1070021 oh of course it takes a while for a tight end because its a great adjustment up at this level you have to be the renaissance man you have to do everything youve got to pass receive deep and underneath you have to pass block you have to run block you have to pass block from the backfield all that stuff youre going to have times where guys come to this level and they havent done all those jobs in college so its a big adjustment hes doing really well and im really pleased with his progress ton of work to do though ton of work to do to master the techniques his hand placement his footwork his assignments all that stuff so weve got a long way to go
1070022 improving every day were not there yet but hes improving every day and thats the message that we give him every day i tell this to guys like witten all the time i say were in search of the perfect play were in search of the perfect rep were in search of the perfect game so the key is the constant pursuit of that were never satisfied until you get it exactly right thats what were preaching thats the message he hears its very clear to him and hes working towards that
1070023 well its a real battle between those guys tony has done a real good job of handling all the jobs and all the different roles and personnel groups theyre both doing well we havent made decisions yet theyre probably both going to contribute this year in different areas and have their own distinct role

1070033 tdrs are a growth management policy that tries to compensate potential losers when you try to constrain that growth
1070034 its an attempt to construct a win win situation depending on how it is executed
1070035 we havent found anybody who seems to think that somehow the beauty of rural albemarle county ought not to be protected the questions are myriad about how you would do it
1070036 we fully intended to have our growth activities occur inside the growth area and i lived out on a farm on fox mountain for a number of years
1070037 i was very disturbed at the rate at which growth was happening where it was not supposed to be happening
1070038 each of those proposals would have to some degree constrained growth at the expense of property rights
1070039 i thought tdrs offered us that special potential opportunity to balance these potentially competing objectives
1070040 if we can get through that process and have an outcome and theres enough people in this room that believe its the right way for the board of supervisors to go ill take it back to my board
1070041 i dont know that everybody in the room has to support it but it better be close to everybody or politically its going to be challenged on arrival
1070042 what we dont know today is the size of that universe of actually usable development rights that would be rendered useless with the downzonings and would therefore be eligible for the tdr program
1070043 if were going to take away from landowners the ability to sell off their land we have to create a mechanism to make them whole
1070044 if we have a market of 20 000 things for sale and it can be sold into a receiving market on a 2 to 1 ratio where theres a demand for 10 000 20 000 arent going to be put on the market next thursday and 10 000 arent going to be bought next thursday
1070045 this is creating a market condition that will be in place for a generation but during that generation of potential transactions we wont be continuing to corrode the rural areas
1070046 they will become rare artifacts and that will be a very elite market and they will not be as available to what i would call small farmers who want to buy land

1070057 i believe this legislation is important as the first national effort to begin to exercise a precautionary principle in the use of chemicals as additives to products that affect human health it is my belief that chemical additives should not be placed in products that can impact health adversely until they are tested and found to be benign
1070058 that congress responded to this health threat in lieu of federal agencies is yet another illustration of the broken regulatory system a better approach is to require chemical manufacturers to prove their products are safe before exposing consumers to them the kid safe chemical act introduced in may by senator frank lautenberg d n j and representatives hilda solis d calif and henry waxman d calif would do just that by overhauling how the epa handles the 80 000 chemicals in consumer products phthalates in toys are just the tip of the iceberg

1070071 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1070072 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1070073 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1070074 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1070075 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1070076 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1070077 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1070078 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1070079 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1070080 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter

1070090 bonuses do not lead to improved performance our high performance has come from work we would have done anyway
1070091 based on the existing body of evidence and our experience implementing male circumcision to strengthen our prevention efforts we are asking the international community to help national governments and their partners to introduce male circumcision wherever hiv prevalence is greatest and circumcision rates are lowest in the nations of eastern and southern africa
1070092 as news gets out about the efficacy of male circumcision we need to meet that demand with quality services and a comprehensive hiv prevention approach and scale up male circumcision as an ethical human rights issue
1070093 we seem to forget that we have an intervention that is 60 to 70 percent effective for preventing hiv in men more effective than any vaccine currently under development
1070094 but the word is getting out just by word of mouth the demand is so great that already men are going to unqualified practitioners and experiencing serious complications we must scale up our response rapidly to meet the demand for safe circumcision services
1070095 specific cells in the foreskin are favored targets for hiv infection
1070096 also the inside of the foreskin lacks the tough covering that protects most skin from infection
1070097 circumcision status was not associated with any sexual dysfunction or with specific sexual dysfunctions premature ejaculation pain during intercourse erectile dysfunction at follow up visits
1070098 the results of this study suggest that hiv risk behaviors are unlikely to increase they may even decline as we saw in our study
1070099 we were struck by this monumental research that shows circumcision having the greatest efficacy in curbing the spread of heterosexual transmission of hiv to date greater than any vaccine in the pipeline today
1070100 free in both mind and body of concerns over hiv
1070101 was how many men seek out the service without our doing any marketing at all of the male circumcision program leading to the concern that awareness of the impact on transmission without access to services may lead to unsafe practices

1070115 you can definitely do it part time and in fact i think thats the best way to start
1070116 this business is open to people from all financial backgrounds a domain costs less than 10 most places so you can start with very little those who already have a lot of money can afford to buy more attractive assets right away but others can certainly build up to the major player level over the years ive seen many people become millionaires
1070117 those who understand domains and what they represent can and have done very well
1070118 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
1070119 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
1070120 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
1070121 i played 20 years ago in seoul when baseball was a demonstration sport i had a great time then
1070122 this will be great because i started my career with the olympics and i feel like this would a great end for it
1070123 ive had five elbow surgeries so its obviously not a new elbow anymore
1070124 but its definitely good enough for one last kick at the can here at the olympics i had seven years in the big leagues and i feel very blessed to have played that long
1070125 this is pretty cool to be able to say i went to the olympics as well
1070126 when i decided to hang them up from professional baseball i was driving home and i wasnt even thinking about the olympics
1070127 then when greg hamilton baseball canadas director of national teams called to ask if i was interested i couldnt resist
1070128 i was actually built up to throw five six seven innings by now
1070129 but i had to take some time off after the injury it set me back a lot and now ill be a one or two inning guy again my body wouldnt allow me to do more
1070130 my whole focus was to get my arm in shape
1070131 i know i can pitch im only a year away from being out of the big leagues my whole thing when i talked to greg was to get my innings where i could get my arm strong and keep it there and i feel its where it was before
1070132 it was great actually more than i thought it was going to end up being
1070133 it was a great experience im glad i did it i got a chance to see a lot of people that i probably hadnt seen in 20 some years plus the fans got a chance to see me live pitching instead of watching me on tv
1070134 and it was a good way to give back to the community to the kids and try to encourage them to keep following their dreams and to never give up

1070141 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1070142 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
1070143 i do not believe that we should use this strategic oil reserves at this point
1070144 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1070145 i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1070146 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution
1070147 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1070148 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore and we need it now he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage and the only thing ive heard him say is that we should inflate our tires so he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face
1070149 we strongly object to this report which merely repeats the prosecutions arguments

1070155 think outside the box and pay attention to customer needs and if you cant do that hire us
1070156 out of curiosity what do you do to verify it
1070157 we scan it through a machine that makes sure its real
1070158 look at it test it with a blacklight call the motor vehicles bureau whatever you are not allowed to record that card electronically
1070159 thats two forms of government issued photo id that should be enough
1070160 the situation with hackers can the data be intercepted can the database be hacked is scary but its not really a realistic threat when you consider the other information available to them like credit card numbers and social security numbers
1070161 this is just yet another database of information on you
1070162 would you like a list of every bar youve visited to be posted on the internet how about marketing would you like to receive more of that this data is sold to and combined with other data about you and sold to a wide variety of companies for marketing
1070163 lets say i had a bar i could offer a drink special for 10 off if you agree to let me sell your drinking data to bacardi theres nothing wrong with that because as the bar owner id be telling you about it upfront and youd have to agree to it but to do this without notifying people by collecting data through age verification is kind of sleazy
1070164 the record of your drinking habits could be used in court as evidence for instance in a divorce case if your wife accuses you of being an alcoholic a record like this could be used but this kind of thing happens all the time in our society do you have some kind of toll booth pass like ez pass data from ez pass usage has been used in divorce cases every time you use a credit card theres a record of the purchase and where it occurred your cell phones whereabouts can also be tracked all of this information is being collected organized and used for all kinds of purposes good and bad
1070165 youre basically screwed because if you dont let them scan your license they make you leave or wont serve you the courts and the ballot box are a better way to fight this matter talking to the employees wont make a difference because as you said its company policy theyre going to do it because its company policy and since the decision about scanning is made far away from the point where it happens youre not going to get anywhere
1070166 this is certainly a violation of our privacy civil liberties

1070168 so i bought a mac and i really didnt like it i told the mac people i knew that i really didnt like my mac and they told me i just needed to get used to it well im used to it and i still dont like the interface i still have trouble getting software to work correctly and it locks up so much i can hardly use it
1070169 it sounds like you have a software problem id save all my data to a dvd or external hard drive and reinstall the operating system
1070170 so i called up my mac friends and asked if they could come over and help me fix this problem and they said that i shouldnt be having any problems because im using a mac

1070177 but i wont let it be the last thing people remember me by as far as a player and as a person im not going to run and hide but i am not going to allow this moment this paragraph or this chapter to define my book of life in the end

1070182 in todays western society the inequality has been revealed of freedom for good deeds and freedom for evil deeds
1070183 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror it is considered to be part of freedom and theoretically counter balanced by the young peoples right not to look or not to accept life organized legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil
1070184 this means that the mistake must be at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries i refer to the prevailing western view of the world which was first born during the renaissance and found its political expression from the period of the enlightenment it became the basis for government and social science and could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him it could also be called anthropocentricity with man seen as the center of everything that exists

1070224 unless policies are adopted in developing countries to strengthen the participation of small farmers especially women in biofuel production by increasing their access to land capital and technology gender inequalities are likely to become more marked and womens vulnerability to hunger and poverty further exacerbated
1070225 biofuel production certainly offers opportunities for farmers but they will only trickle down to the farm level especially to women if pro poor policies are put in place that also empower women

1070284 it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserved to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games
1070285 the itf believes that a transparent and consistent system of entry is the only possible way for tennis as an olympic sport to have credibility with players and fans
1070286 every tennis event around the world uses the world ranking as the basis for entry and the itf finds it difficult to accept that criteria can be changed from country to country depending on the views of particular national olympic committees

1070306 la coag tenemos muy claro que hay gente que se han escindido de nuestra organizaci n por meras motivaciones pol ticas ante ello la forma m s clara de responder a quienes nos acusan de estar plegados ante los intereses del psoe es la m xima popular que dice piensa el ladr n que todos son de su condici n
1070307 nosotros valoramos el hecho de que antes no hace muchos a os un agricultor o ganadero jubilado apenas si llegaba a obtener una pensi n de unas 80 000 pesetas hoy tras la reforma del r gimen especial agrario del trabajador aut nomo el pensionista cobra cerca de 130 000 pesetas a los gobiernos hay que valorarlos por sus avances ahora si hay quien se niega a verlo as respetamos sus opiniones
1070308 la que m s manifestaciones convoc en madrid la que m s con mucha diferencia y es curioso los que hoy nos acusan de habernos plegado al gobierno del psoe no participaron en esas movilizaciones por lo tanto en la coag creemos que las personas se acreditan o desacreditan por lo que hacen y no por lo que dicen es muy f cil sembrar la desconfianza entre la gente de buena fe entre los trabajadores nuestra gente est harta de palabras y promesas los agricultores y ganaderos quieren soluciones y desde luego no nos parece nada correcto pretender justificar una escisi n diciendo que los malos son los otros
1070309 en nuestra opini n la organizaci n mundial del comercio no es buena siempre hemos defendido la necesidad que tiene la agricultura de salirse de la omc al final lo nico que se obtiene con la liberalizaci n es el desplazar a los pa ses que est n en v as de desarrollo s lo se consigue que cinco grandes empresas multinacionales se lleven todos los beneficios de los acuerdos que se adopten en la omc

1070311 tengo constancia de que este a o se han devuelto tres millones de euros de un sector que est en una profunda crisis y ello se ha producido por una gran error de planificaci n de alguien que tiene nombres y apellidos el se or viceconsejero de agricultura del gobierno de canarias
1070312 nuestra valoraci n es netamente positiva el se or demetrio su rez ha tenido el valor de sacar adelante a pesar de las enormes presiones que ha recibido un mercado en el que los agricultores pueden vender directamente sus productos a los consumidores
1070313 nosotros no vamos a entrar en pol mica con nadie los datos est n ah y son objetivos cada a o desaparecen 300 empresas agr colas la venta agraria viene cayendo a o tras a o desde antes de la crisis y con la crisis tambi n en definitiva la superficie de cultivo disminuye con cada a o que pasa en la coag sabemos que el peque o comercio est sufriendo por efecto de la gran distribuci n lo que tienen que hacer el peque o comercio es aliarse con los agricultores y no con las grandes cadenas de distribuci n es una cuesti n de estrategia lo que resulta incomprensible es que el peque o comercio no identifique todav a qui n es el que les est apretando las clavijas qui n les est desplazando fuera del mercado

1070359 we appreciate your call to reform new york state government especially since the changes you are advocating are ones that we have long advocated for and enthusiastically supported
1070360 most of your priorities already have passed in our republican led senate and we welcome your commitment to greater fiscal responsibility property tax reform more open and accountable state government and a more prosperous economy
1070361 the differences in priorities and philosophies between republicans and democrats in the state legislature are enormous the facts speak for themselves we in the senate republican majority have consistently championed an extensive agenda that gives relief to our hard working overburdened taxpayers revitalizes the economy and changes the way albany does business our voting record proves it
1070362 unfortunately state democrats have a record of blocking or fighting against these measures no matter whether they are from upstate or downstate new york that is why many of these bills have not been passed in the state assembly however in many instances we have successfully enlisted the publics support to help us force them to make the right decisions for our families
1070363 without the checks and balances we assure state government would be totally controlled by democrats from new york city keep in mind that a democrat controlled senate would be lead by malcolm smith of queens tom duane from greenwich village manhattan and jeff klein from the bronx the assembly would be lead by speaker sheldon silver of manhattan thus it is critical that you join our fight and help us achieve reform

1070404 se corre el riesgo de imitar el muy criticado modelo brit nico que ha llegado a ser calificado de verg enza por los laboristas
1070405 en la mayor a de los casos en que se inicia este proceso se enjuicia la idoneidad del sector p blico acus ndolo de ineficacia lo que nos resulta m s una coartada ideol gica para presentar estos sistemas como si de una intervenci n empresarial altruista se tratara cuando en realidad lo que se pretende es poder repartir mayores dividendos entre sus accionistas

1070407 la administraci n es capaz de gestionar eficientemente los recursos humanos y materiales que la sociedad ha puesto en manos del estado y en este sentido nuestro modelo aeroportuario p blico es un ejemplo porque ha permitido afrontar el crecimiento del tr fico a reo y desarrollar las infraestructuras necesarias mantenimiento de las tasas m s bajas y competitivas de europa un 40 por ciento inferiores a la media europea autofinanciaci n sin ninguna aportaci n de los presupuestos generales del estado ptimos niveles de seguridad y operatividad aeroportuaria vertebraci n del estado y un mayor desarrollo y equilibrio territorial
1070408 los beneficios de baa aumentan a costa del bienestar de los pasajeros y de los propios beneficios de las aerol neas con lo que la sociedad en su conjunto sale perjudicada
1070409 en conclusi n podemos decir que el modelo aeroportuario de aena es un ejemplo envidiado a nivel internacional y el peligro de la privatizaci n reside en que m s que un inter s por mejorar un servicio p blico lo que se da es un inter s por querer tomar parte en el goloso pastel que representa aena para las empresas privadas
1070410 cuenta con importantes fortalezas que nos deben ayudar a superar la situaci n actual entre las que se encuentra el di logo social que debe dotarse de mayor relevancia
1070411 los datos indican que el menor ritmo de crecimiento y de creaci n de empleo y el aumento del desempleo est n afectando a todos los grupos de trabajadores en todas las actividades econ micas aunque los hombres dedicados al sector de la construcci n siguen siendo los m s perjudicados si bien el sector servicios refleja un notable aumento

1070413 esto supone un fraude de ley con repercusiones muy negativas sobre los trabajadores y los recursos de la seguridad social que debe ser perseguido de forma espec fica por la inspecci n de trabajo

1070417 i didnt have to tell my kids get up they got up on their own
1070418 they were telling me lets go mom we got games we got practice so it was something that they just enjoyed doing
1070419 it was like the next big thing and its just taken off since
1070420 we didnt really think that brenda or patty would be able to make the olympics because they were short
1070421 then brenda and patty showed them that their size didnt really count and then they just showed their talent and now that theyre in the olympics i think that i have a pretty good chance to go to the olympics too
1070422 they make us work harder because they show us that if they can do it then we can do it
1070423 i think itd be standing room only to see that game live on a big screen
1070424 to watch two kids that theyve seen grow up or two neighbors or two cousins or two friends that they went to school with playing in the gold medal game in the olympics would be awesome for us

1070434 most alarming from the perspective of asean was the fact that some of the equipment for the burmese navy had to be installed and at least partially maintained by chinese technicians to asean strategists this meant that the chinese had gained a toehold in the maritime region between india and southeast asia for the first time
1070435 soon the northern region of burma will be swamped by the chinese government officials workers truck drivers and businessmen said larry it will no longer be burma but the autonomous region of china as prof dr khin maung kyi has predicted in his special lecture at the aeiou the burmese university in diaspora the chinese authorities are planning to use burma as a crucial transit point not just for the products grown or manufactured in southwestern china but as a way of transporting goods from the countrys economic powerhouses along the eastern seaboard by shifting the transit route away from the south china sea and the malacca strait to using burmas port facilities to reach south asia the middle east and europe they hope to avoid the dangers of crowded shipping lanes and pirates the malacca dilemma as beijing calls it some time ago the chinese authorities decided that the only way to insure their existing investment in burma was to strengthen economic and business ties with burma
1070436 they no longer trust north korea and were dismayed that two important neighbors had effectively gone behind their backs and resumed relations
1070437 if there is one thing we need to do above all it is to end the culture of impunity which underlies so many abuses
1070438 there are widespread reports of serious human rights abuses including rape by burmese military personnel in conflict areas and other ethnic minority areas
1070439 tell china that it can have its olympic games or burma which also stands for darfur and rawanda it cant have both if a threat to those games could help tip the balance then let the games not begin some things matter more

1070503 apparel is one of the largest u s e commerce categories accounting for roughly 15 percent of total online retail sales
1070504 however some of the biggest retailers in the category are significantly underrepresented in the online display ad market given the internets proven ability to drive both online and offline sales those retailers failing to make use of this growing advertising channel are overlooking a substantial opportunity
1070505 theres no question about the combined power of search and offline channels that is well established
1070506 whats missing from this equation is the right environment to truly push integration forward and fully reap its benefits it is incumbent upon the cmo to break down the silos eliminate the obstacles that plague its progress and create a culture that rewards integrated efforts
1070507 look at the scandalous sacrifice you are requiring of we pride ourselves on having some of the most open honest debate anywhere about the crisis in our church
1070508 if the wto permits the continuation of the monetisation of food aid resources for purposes not connected to the cost of food aid delivery it will undermine the credibility of the food aid convention the international treaty on food aid at a critical moment
1070509 as important as some of the other uses of monetisation proceeds may be for example purchase and supply of agricultural inputs it would be far wiser to seek these resources in the form of cash assistance rather than jeopardise the system of international food aid as a whole
1070510 the result is grotesquely inefficient the cost of shipping food from the united states to a recipient country to be sold on the open market thereby displacing commercial sales of both local and imported production wastes half or more of the value of the aid monetised aid is not targeted at the households that need the food
1070511 monetisation increases volatility in local markets and often causes abrupt if temporary price falls these market conditions discourage local production yet livelihoods food security and rural development all depend on stimulating increased production in food aid recipient countries
1070512 during this food crisis we should be improving rules to ensure much needed food gets to as many people as possible not allowing a highly inefficient and trade distorting system to continue
1070513 nearly all other food aid donor countries agree an untied cash based system would make the best use of scarce and expensive food aid resources
1070514 these tying practices are prima facie a form of export subsidy
1070515 there is some sympathy for proposals to avoid the use of food aid as a way of offloading surpluses and expanding market share
1070516 how best to ensure that the aid goes to those really in need does not harm domestic production in countries receiving aid does not distort trade in particular jeopardise exports from competing suppliers responds genuinely to demand does not amount to the disposal of surpluses in subsidising countries and does not allow countries to get around their export subsidy commitments
1070517 most countries argue that aid should only be in the form of grants i e not on credit but some warn that this could be too rigid and prevent food aid from promptly reaching those who need it
1070518 many developing countries are calling for binding commitments from donor countries on the amounts they supply with rising amounts of food at times of high prices aid supplies in response to demand technical and financial assistance to help countries develop domestic production instead of relying on food aid and increased transparency through notifications to the wto agriculture committee some developed countries also endorse some of these ideas
1070519 the us argued that opening markets was the best way to achieve food security and to promote livelihoods
1070520 india and china supported by the majority of developing country members argued for a strong safeguard mechanism to protect food security and livelihoods in the event of major disruptions to agricultural markets

1070845 employee ownership is a great help when things are tough because we dont have institutional investors breathing down our necks pushing us to cut costs

1070847 the business was built on sustainability before anybody started using the word and sustainability remains at its core
1070848 but does this historic view of ownership as stewardship still apply in the age of global capital flows instant trading and complex derivatives stewardship means a sense of responsibility for that which you own and handle every day it implies that the business should be around for generations and that the owner is responsible for handing it on to the next generation in better shape than he or she inherited it so is ownership as stewardship a sentimental concept that is rooted in our past and rendered obsolete by the death of distance and the impersonal operation of global capital markets does the idea of ownership obligations actually get in the way of the efficient allocation of capital in global markets and hold managers back from making the right decisions for the business are concerns about sustainability best met through trying to hang on to the idea that owners have obligations or will sustainability only be achieved through the imposition of external rules on businesses
1070849 mexico is not prepared for this for the tremendous problems
1070850 we are here on the call today to really begin to look at what we are going to hear for the rest of the day which is the unveiling of barack obamas energy plan for the future
1070851 so it is clear that this is an issue that is very important to our economy and to the families of america and i believe that what we will see today is barack obama attempting to paint a picture of an energy plan that frankly is not based on developing more american energy supply i believe that anyone who says that we can achieve energy independence in this country without that without more nuclear power without more offshore drilling without more clean coal doesnt have the experience to understand the problem we are faced with or isnt being straightforward to the american people

1070856 just coming to america there are so many things it makes me really appreciate
1070857 i used that to kind of motivate myself and see how hard people work and how proud people are to represent their country

1070881 we opened every show then taj mahal played then the band minus robbie robertson and then michelle shocked
1070882 we were on the tour for the first five or six shows our last one was at carnegie hall
1070883 one of my last memories of that tour was standing outside carnegie hall in the rain in a flannel shirt thinking we could have been better
1070884 the show got a good review in musician magazine though
1070885 so i got to the task of learning every song
1070886 they encapsulated what i liked about music as a young person in his early 20s they rocked hard i had no idea that they were going down such an intense folk route on the new album

1070894 maybe with the giving away of his money he would justify what he had done to get that money
1070895 any honest review of he 20 th century to date would conclude the evil empire is the us there is virtually no country which was not attacked by the us or whose government was not overthrown the u s has over 1 000 military bases in over 130 countries to date we are 3 the population of earth but spend 51 of the entire military budget the enemy is us
1070896 my political belief is that the u s is a horrendous empire that needs to end
1070897 whereas slavery in america resembled no other form of involuntary servitude known in history as africans were captured and sold at auction like inanimate objects or animals
1070898 it is crucial to realize that such slaves were being treated essentially as animals a fact symbolized by their ritualistic slaughter and the final cannibal feast this behavior dramatizes the point that wholly apart from later economic functions slaves from the very beginning were perceived as dehumanized humans humans deprived of precisely those traits and faculties that are prerequisites for human dignity respect and honor
1070899 compared the teaching of slaves unlike that of free workers with the training of wild animals
1070900 a commitment to god myself my family my friends my future mate and my future children to a lifetime of purity including sexual abstinence from this day until the day i enter a biblical marriage relationship
1070901 were less likely to be sexually active over the three year study period than other youth who were similar to them but who did not make a virginity pledge
1070902 if its your intention as a teen to not have sex its perhaps a good idea to make a pledge because youre more likely to delay sex if you do so and not more likely to engage in other sexual behaviors as a substitute
1070903 ive never really heard the clutch player thing until just recently
1070904 when you are playing with a college you are just trying to make the team better
1070905 shes one of the fastest players on our team and i think as long as we can keep putting her in positions to score goals for us shell continue to do so
1070906 what ive found with amy is when she gets those opportunities and chances she capitalizes on them
1070907 you have to be prepared to step up at any time
1070908 and im ready to do that abby is irreplaceable but i know and my teammates know i have something to bring to the game and i plan on doing that in my own way
1070909 but she is a young player so she has her ups and downs sometimes she plays tremendously well and sometimes she doesnt have a good day
1070910 defending a rod is very difficult she is so fast you cant stay with her she reminds me a lot of tiffeny milbrett and brazils marta if you let a rod turn you with the ball youre fried and her turn is so quick and explosive
1070911 she just has a really good sense of humor and she just is always having a good time
1070912 i was really torn at the time because i wasnt sure what my chances were with the team school is important to me i took a chance
1070913 now i feel like with abby out someone needs to step up and take that position
1070914 well she is young and you have to perform not only once or twice
1070915 the fact that she is young and has so many things to learn its one thing to play 45 minutes compared with 90 minutes
1070916 i think its an exciting time to be amy rodriguez
1070917 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
1070918 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
1070919 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
1070920 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
1070921 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
1070922 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
1070923 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
1070924 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
1070925 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
1070926 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

1070932 behold i have inscribed you on the palms of my hands
1070933 oh yeah i guess were going to have a late night talking
1070934 apparently i wasnt clear enough this morning on my position with respect to the war in iraq
1070935 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1070936 so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
1070937 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
1070938 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race

1070950 when ahmadinejad was elected in 2005 there were some who argued that the reformist experiment had been an exercise in wishful thinking that had not reflected the reality of iran and that with ahmadinejads election the real raw iran had finally come to the foreground

1070954 im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run thats it its already made
1070955 its just the fact that because ive not been running huge amounts at full body weight outside on it they team gb dont know whether it will get me there
1070956 the only decision that would be made would be made for me and i dont want to think about that
1070957 this time i think ive had the worst period of stress and now its just get on and enjoy it
1070958 im actually thinking its going to be more like the 2002 london marathon when i had the nightmare with my knee three weeks before and didnt even know ifid be ready to start that race
1070959 i would say people have seen that the level between the mexican clubs and mls teams is similar
1070960 the depth in fmf is greater but you see now with the teams playing in competitions that the gap is closing
1070961 i think you saw that post game in the semifinals
1070962 they see the gap closing and they dont like that
1070963 we always think whats happened in the past doesnt count
1070964 weve beaten houston already but that means nothing its who gets the job done on the night the past is exactly that the past
1070965 and we feel a little fortunate some times we know they are a good team and we respect them as much as they respect us over the past four or five years these have been the two best franchises in the league so to meet again in a final is pretty special wed still like to hold the edge on those finals but theyre a good team
1070966 the reality is that were not being compensated to be dealing with this to have last night go like it did its just a microcosm of the whole situation
1070967 how it ended up touching the wires whether a piece of equipment failed and it slipped and touched the wires or whether the act of jacking it up higher on one side caused it to touch we just dont know yet
1070968 as we stand here today we intend to keep both drivers and i dont think thats ever been in any doubt to be honest
1070969 im just happy that he had a really strong race here
1070970 jarno would have had a stronger race if he hadnt been caught behind mark webber because of a bad start
1070971 overall im very happy we had a strong result today
1070972 certainly from the moment he drove out of the garage on friday he has been on it all weekend
1070973 if you really look at his sector times from qualifying earlier in the season he was struggling to put a complete lap together but generally showing he had the speed to do it
1070974 he proved to himself in hockenheim particularly on race pace how quick he was and the fact he had an issue and he just continued from that point this weekend
1070975 you have a great voice you should be on the radio
1070976 estamos apurando em conjunto com a dig delegacia de investiga es gerais mas n o temos pistas ainda
1070977 i saw him break the glass crawl through and try to get into the office one way he decided he couldnt get in that way and tried another i was thrilled to see his face that was a great shot
1070978 were going to put a more secure door in for the 2nd time is this a situation where were going to have to put bars on school windows the keep thieves out
1070979 i hope someone will recognize the man and turn him in even if it is for two dollars its more than that its replacing the door its the sense of insecurity
1070980 in most cases we found that the parent or other adult responsible for supervising the child simply was not present when the injury occurred
1070981 young children need nearly constant supervision and of course thats not always possible but it should be the parents highest priority many infants died because parents placed them in an unsafe sleep environment parents may not be aware of whats safe and what isnt especially with so much new information being released about safe sleeping environments for infants in other cases parents failed to use mandated safety devices such as car seats or the adult was present when the injury occurred but could not protect the child because they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol
1070982 what we know is that these injuries can be prevented
1070983 the importance of intervention is huge recognizing at risk families can help care providers take proper action nurses and other health care providers often encounter families with young children but there isnt enough time to address all aspects of child care with every single family care providers can use these findings to identify high risk families and provide them with specific information or referrals

1070986 once you get to dam neck it goes pretty fast its more of a straight shot you get on the bike path you dont have to worry about so many drivers
1070987 the average is you know were seeing maybe five to six miles but we are seeing a lot more people that are going ten 15 some people are even going 20 miles
1070988 making cycling irresistible lessons from the netherlands denmark and germany
1070989 because obama is at the head of the ticket hes going to create an awareness and an impetus to go and vote
1070990 this is an opportunity african americans have never had before and it may not be an opportunity they have again
1070991 i think republicans in mississippi were happy to have wicker appointed to the seat they thought he would win election fairly easily
1070992 but it turns out he is in a very very tight race
1070993 kuntar it was never about him it was the sacred promise of sayed hassan to return the prisoners that was pursued the file on kuntar was symbolic to show that only armed resistance can force the zionists to act
1070994 he is only free because of his value as a message to those who want us to talk without the dignity of arms
1070995 you dont want to know how hard this is for us
1070996 there was national pride when the resistance freed the south from israeli occupation even if you opposed hezbollah and supported israel you felt some pride to see lebanon liberated but over this one thousand people hundreds of children died in the 2006 war to free this monster none of us even know hezbollah freed him to show they could and now they will make us celebrate their victory because they know they can
1070997 the age of defeats is gone and the era of victories has come

1071004 yeah shes one of mine danced under lexie real name is sarah brown with an h i think
1071005 her id has her as sarah brown shes a student at coast college
1071006 from back east somewhere she wasnt a talker more of a listener
1071007 i dont know her trigger and she wasnt that powerful i could feel it in her but not irritating you know
1071008 i think it was an empathic thing shed get customers talking to her then theyd buy dances she was as much a shrink as she was a dancer
1071009 not that i noticed of course other girls spilled their guts to her so that might have gotten her down

1071396 the work we are doing focuses on finding out more at a molecular level about how fast muscle can switch to slow muscle and could lead to a better understanding of how to genetically choose animals for breeding that will produce better quality meat
1071397 this new tool offers a google maps like view of integrative genomic data
1071398 it brings together different kinds of genomic data into a single holistic view im incredibly proud of our computational scientists for responding so rapidly and effectively to the critical needs of the growing genomics research community
1071399 other tools offer detailed localized views of genomic data and a few tools are equipped to provide a whole genome view
1071400 igv was designed to integrate both and to provide smooth zooming and panning across all resolution scales
1071401 most visualization tools are limited in their ability to handle multiple types of genomic data and are typically retrofitted to accommodate new data types as they have arisen
1071402 igv was designed from the ground up to integrate all of these data and to provide a strong platform for future growth and refinement
1071403 before i was introduced to igv i had to use three different programs to visually integrate my data
1071404 but now this one universal browser allows me to rapidly scan the entire genome and identify promising regions which has revolutionized my work
1071405 this tool is designed to enable researchers to view many types of genomic data especially those relevant to human disease
1071406 were particularly excited about its already groundbreaking use in ongoing studies of the cancer
1071407 job growth matters but only if you could get it where jobs are needed the most we found that jobs had a bigger impact on reducing poverty in smaller metropolitan areas because if you live in a small area you can get to where the jobs are but if you live in columbus or cleveland or new york or atlanta it is going to be harder to get to the jobs
1071408 many lower skilled workers are single mothers with children who dont have reliable transportation their kids get sick so they miss a couple of days of work and then they get fired so finding ways of breaking down this kind of barrier so they can work can really make a difference
1071409 you tend to find out about jobs from your friends coworkers and neighbors but if you live in an area that is downtown and the jobs are being created out in the suburbs it will be more difficult to find out what jobs are available
1071410 in some suburbs there are particular kinds of zoning that make it difficult to create affordable housing lot size requirements and zoning that keeps out apartments puts limits on where people can move if they have limited resources all of these three barriers public transportation information about new jobs and housing barriers keep the people from low income households from getting the jobs that are available far from home
1071411 these data provide unprecedented insight into the toxicity of ems for humans they will change the long held perceptions of the hazards posed by low doses of some genotoxic carcinogens
1071412 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1071413 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1071414 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1071415 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
1071416 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life
1071417 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1071418 im not into labels but if you call me a reformer its shorthand for people to understand what youre talking about

1071423 its wrong to tell many people that if you cant afford to leave your day job dont bother running
1071424 its a politics of exclusion and i find it offensive what youre doing is youre saying a wallace school teacher should be excluded while a teacher from the private hudson school is automatically included in beths universe of eligible candidates

1071431 these results mean that the tevatron experiments are very much in the game for finding the higgs
1071432 in the past year alone the two experiments have produced 77 ph d s and 100 publications that advance the state of our knowledge across the span of particle physics at the energy frontier
1071433 the discovery of the higgs boson would answer one of the big questions in physics today
1071434 we have not heard the last from the tevatron experiments
1071435 community recreation and parks is the health provider that you dont know about
1071436 traditionally these agencies are considered as organizers of games and sports in a towns parks or ball fields but our study shows that 9 out of 10 recreation and park professionals are actively involved in a health partnership sometimes several of them
1071437 twenty years ago health care providers didnt consider recreation and park professionals to be a partner in the campaigns to promote health but in the 1990s community based health partnerships were starting to consider the role of recreation and parks in promoting physical activity and quality of life since many related programs are offered by recreation and park managers
1071438 health campaigns naturally involve recreation and park departments because they provide low cost close to home opportunities for physical activity such as trails recreation centers outdoor courts and outdoor swimming facilities
1071439 parks trails and recreation centers can also serve as settings for physical rehabilitation
1071440 having facilities is critical but then programs also have to be established to bring in residents and encourage them to take part
1071441 partnerships that include after school programs diet and nutritional information and policy efforts to promote recreational settings should be encouraged
1071442 the study was designed to provide baseline information on the state of current health partnership practices within the profession their successes and their challenges
1071443 such information can be used to help a community effectively develop a program in health and physical activity promotion
1071444 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents or are they something we should be concerned about we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances

1071449 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1071450 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1071451 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1071452 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1071453 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1071454 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the

1071467 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
1071468 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
1071469 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
1071470 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
1071471 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza

1071529 a method often used in laboratories which enables the easy and efficient separation of mixtures of chemical compounds using the phenomenon of adsorption the techniques strengths are especially manifested in the separation of isomers and natural materials in 1910 tswett first used this method in the separation of leaf pigments and the technique achieved rapid growth later when it was applied to the separation of carotinoid pigments among other uses the separation method called column chromatography uses a glass column filled with adsorbent though which passes a composite liquid mixture the technique operates such that each component will form in a different section of the column arranged by color according to the adsorption affinity of each material in performing column chromatography a vertical glass column is filled evenly with the proper amount of adsorbent next a liquid mixture is poured into the column and the liquid passes through the adsorbent each compound is absorbed into beds at different heights depending on the components individual adsorption affinity at this stage the sections into which each of the components have been absorbed are still not completely separated however if the appropriate desorbent is poured into the column the components which have been adsorbed on the adsorbent dissolve into the desorbent and start moving downwards in the column each component moves towards the lower part of the column but the migration rates again differ according to each components adsorption affinity the components in the lower layers move faster and in the end each components will be clearly separated this stage of the column chromatography process is called development if the material being separated is a mixture of pigments there will be colored zones at different heights in the column filled with adsorbent these colored zones are called a chromatogram when the development stage is over and the pigments appear the adsorbent is pushed out of the column divided into each zone and the absorbates are extracted separately using a desorbent this stage of the process is called elution alternately without removing the adsorbent from the column a desorbent may be successively poured in from above and each zone preferentially eluted by the desorbent will dissolve into it and trickle down the column one at a time the liquids can then be collected from the bottom of the column as they drip out

1071583 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
1071584 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
1071585 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
1071586 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
1071587 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now
1071588 every time i hear the pager go off you know you wonder whos gonna be there and whos not
1071589 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day
1071590 i hate to admit it but theres been more times this year where other departments have had to help us out
1071591 we pat them on the back as hard as we can

1071593 he said that one of the reasons he needed to fence off his property was that when he was living in switzerland
1071594 he was interrupted so much he couldnt get any work done
1071595 hed always been a fairly enigmatic person and him making a public appearance to the local townspeople that went a long way with the folks in town
1071596 when the news media found out he was in cavendish they just descended on the town to find out everything they could people wouldnt tell them anything
1071597 no matter how late it was he seemed to be working
1071598 our children grew up and went to school here alongside your children
1071599 indeed our whole family has felt at home among you exile is always difficult and yet i could not imagine a better place to live and wait and wait for my return home than cavendish vermont
1071600 your idea that humans only have moral status in virtue of the fact that people care about them or that they live in communities which value them is problematic
1071601 are you going to bite the bullet and say that when people stop caring about others then they cease to have any moral standing
1071602 well we dont force them to work here and at least theyre not on the streets besides its not my fault that the world desires silk stockings and that our stockholders demand adequate returns on their investments i couldnt do anything about it if i wanted to anyway i think its really the government that should be doing something about the poor things its not our fault theyre too poor and uneducated to find work elsewhere
1071603 is there anything wrong with causing them to suffer so horribly at the hands of others
1071604 je mehr ich an das endspiel denke desto w tender werde ich mit dem schiri war etwas falsch man muss sehr vorsichtig sein aber das mindeste was man sagen kann ist der schiedsrichter war parteiisch er hat gegen die spanier eine rote karte nicht gezeigt ein handspiel gegen uns hat er auch nicht gepfiffen

1071607 the advanced bluetec system is a technological marvel that brings out the best of diesel technology while virtually eliminating the shortcomings
1071608 the e320 bluetec filled an important spot on the list its a satisfying utterly well built luxury vehicle that just happens to have a very advanced and economical engine and transmission

1071616 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1071617 there is a limit on how much profit you can take
1071618 we feel that it is consistent with the governments approach that it wants to listen and learn from the experiences of people in this country
1071619 we will continue to work with the energy companies and others to make sure that we provide help including social tariffs for those groups

1071657 i live in the northeast and its so crunchy and crisp in the fall that i couldnt possibly imagine myself anywhere else it is so hard to pick just one thing autumn is exhilarating apple orchards are one of the best especially with apple cider donuts all warm and crunchy and crumbly for clothing its just the delight in layering without winter coats tweed things cardigans sullen makeup and halloween
1071658 version 2 0 is the culmination of the evolution of i o virtualization for the first time it allows running our software on a customers own hardware
1071659 it reduces the number of lan local area network and wan wide area network ports by 80 percent
1071660 we tried to make the administrators do the least amount of work so we differentiated between server administrators and infrastructure architects for the server admins there is no need to rely on others to approve changes because the infrastructure architects have all the planning done
1071661 i o virtualization is a crucial step towards the next generation data center
1071662 3leaf is leading the charge in this area with a software solution that runs on commodity hardware
1071663 there are unimplemented bits bugs etc that need to be sorted out but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
1071664 the web has faced fragmented video standards for over a decade now
1071665 everyones experienced broken video support whether it be a flash plug in that crashes or an unsupported browser
1071666 if these things were to just work that would be a huge improvement in the browsing experience we will have the same user experience with videos and other multimedia that we currently have with images
1071667 theres the official standards then the kind of force of nature standards
1071668 you get this tipping point a most people use it so i want to use it kind of thing
1071669 eventually the platform represents a significant point and then all of a sudden stuff thats proprietary looks kind of stranded and obsolete
1071670 its not like some magic is going to happen these kind of things tend to move over time kind of like the adoption of the firefox browser itself
1071671 its not like microsoft hasnt used ogg in the past the halo games for pc used ogg vorbis for all of their music for instance
1071672 it would just be present and work and they wouldnt have to fuss about it thats the end goal for open source

1071676 we have now learned that 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006 not 40 000 that had been previously cited these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
1071677 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
1071678 thats life if nothing else its life its real and sometimes it fuckin hurts but its sort of all we have
1071679 why is the blog so great well its combining so many things in literature communication and technology it has already become very popular and influential and is only going to get bigger as we venture through the twenty first century
1071680 the wiki and the blogs create a dialogue between writers while everyone is anonymous on the blogs outsiders can still read and respond to what is being said anonymity lets students truly speak there mind and say what is important without feeling embarrassed
1071681 when classes are run quite similarly it becomes a good way to rework assignments to use them in the future
1071682 aside from the aspects of wiki which allow students to post work it also serves as a forum for information about class stephs students are able to keep up to date on homework assignments as well as in class activities

1071687 we are god fearing people and we believe in the american system and we believe it will ultimately turn out ok
1071688 there are people who would like to see us leave but on the whole we have very warm relations

1071692 and he was a total jerk to me both times
1071693 cmon it was thirty seconds of his life and ive seen all his movies and therefore thats some kind of personal connection that he will want to acknowledge
1071694 what would help that jeopardy guy have a nice day at the bite would it be having half a dozen awkward conversations about jeopardy with total strangers or would it be getting left alone to enjoy the day with this family

1071704 we talk to los everyday looking for ways to work from anywhere web based loss like mortgagedashboard tm are leading the way in making that happen so really this integration was a no brainer

1071706 the mortgage market is slowing down so we want to offer originators every opportunity to originate more loans

1071708 i dont believe that the doha round is yet a failure
1071709 i think there were difficulties and in that difficulty it was better to stop to reflect how to continue
1071710 i was very clear with bush that it is not possible that two countries as important as the united states and india which are negotiating a nuclear agreement cant find the conditions to make a deal on the issue of food because there is very little remaining differences between them
1071711 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
1071712 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
1071713 basically i got a lot of stuff on my album thats not that simple its just basically a way to calm things down
1071714 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1071715 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
1071716 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
1071717 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
1071718 im excited its good to have him back in the house
1071719 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
1071720 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
1071721 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
1071722 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
1071723 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
1071724 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback
1071725 im not going to change any direction that weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation tomorrow and we have all the confidence in the world in aaron
1071726 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1071727 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1071728 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1071729 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1071730 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1071731 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1071732 employers today want to support their employees efforts to adopt healthier lifestyles
1071733 regence activate offers a solution by encouraging members to become active partners in their health care decisions and rewarding them directly for that behavior
1071734 regence activate offers a win win for employers and their employees
1071735 employees will reap the benefits of healthy living and managing their own health care while regence partners with their employer to incentivize the right behavior
1071736 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1071737 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower
1071738 people are looking for any excuse to sell oil right now
1071739 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1071740 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1071741 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1071742 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1071743 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1071744 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle

1071750 allstates sponsorship is helping in our mission to strengthen the black filmmaking community through resource sharing artistic collaboration and career development
1071751 while we expect industry pressures to also weaken fords liquidity we estimate that ford will end 2009 with 15 3 billion in cash without raising additional cash
1071752 we werent talking about cursory stuff what kind of clothes to wear we were talking trial strategy
1071753 theres no question that these calls are privileged and we rely on that because the criminal justice system would come to a screeching halt if we had to drive to the jail every time we had to talk to our clients
1071754 anyone could call and ask that their numbers be added to the database but the problem was that we didnt do as much as we could have in publicizing this fact
1071755 the first thing you hear when you pick up the phone is that your call can be recorded
1071756 if you didnt register your phone number with the list then you didnt do your job the onus is on you
1071757 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong

1071761 my hands are fine while my feet are black from frostbite anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1071762 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1071763 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1071764 i would love it if everyone could contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers they put me through the wringer but its so beautiful the night will be long but beautiful

1071773 semua pengusaha kantin diminta tidak menggunakan bekas polisterina dalam kegiatan penjualan makanan dan sebagai alternatifnya pelanggan diminta makan di kafeteria menggunakan bekas eco pack dengan harga tambahan sebanyak 20 sen atau membawa bekas makanan sendiri
1071774 saya yakin tambahan 20 sen tidak menjadi beban dan jika warga kampus membawa bekas makanan sendiri adalah lebih baik dan menjimatkan
1071775 bekas polisterina ini juga memberi kesan kepada alam sekitar kerana memerlukan sekurang kurangnya 500 tahun untuk reput manakala jumlah tenaga yang tinggi untuk memusnahkannya

1071809 vroeger liepen wij altijd achter de bundesbank aan die bestemde in feite het monetaire beleid voor heel europa nu praten we in frankfurt mee en hebben dus ook een vinger in de pap dat is een veel actievere rol dan vroeger toen we alleen maar de bundesbank volgden
1071810 strikt formeel kan dnb niet zelfstandig de inflatie te lijf met een renteverhoging maar in adviserende rol kunnen we wel degelijk wat doen we zitten in tal van adviesorganen die onder meer de sociale partners kunnen oproepen de lonen te matigen

1071816 totdat ik zelf in het westen kwam en twee jaar kon rondkijken kon ik mij niet voorstellen hoe sterk het westen een wereld is geworden zonder wilskracht een wereld die geleidelijk is versteend in het aanzicht van het naderende gevaar wij allen staan op de drempel van een grote historische ramp een vloed die de beschaving op zal slokken en hele tijdperken zal veranderen
1071817 men gelooft dat alle andere landen slechts tijdelijk door geslepen regeringen grote crises hun eigen barbarij of onbegrip worden afgehouden van het pad naar de westerse pluralistische democratie en de westerse leefstijl landen worden beoordeeld naar de mate van vooruitgang op dat pad maar dat is een idee dat is ontstaan uit westers onbegrip over de essentie van andere landen uit de fout om hen langs de westerse meetlat te leggen het echte beeld van de ontwikkeling op aarde is heel anders
1071818 op onze weg vanaf de renaissance tot nu hebben we onze ervaring verrijkt maar we hebben het concept verloren van een hoogste complete entiteit dat vroeger onze passies en onverantwoordelijke eigenschappen in de hand hield we hebben te veel hoop gevestigd in politieke en sociale hervormingen om te ontdekken dat we waren beroofd van ons meest kostbare bezit ons spirituele leven in het communistische oosten is dit vernietigd door de machinaties van de heersende partij in het westen verstikken handelsbelangen het dit is de echte crisis
1071819 het moderne rusland heeft geen parlement een zwakke regering geen juridisch gezag de figuur van gorbatsjov is overdreven in het westen zowel zijn persoonlijkheid als zijn rol in recente gebeurtenissen er is niets gedaan om het lot van de bevolking of de economie te verbeteren gorbatsjov koos de verkeerde weg hij verspeelde zeven jaar en heeft niets nuttigs bereikt

1071825 en de zwaluw dat is een methode uit de soechanovka maar ook de gevangenis van archangjelsk kende die een lange handdoek van ruw linnen wordt je dan door de mond getrokken het optuigen en daarna over de rug met de einden aan je hielen vastgeknoopt en zo mag je dan opgebonden als een rad een dag of twee met een krakende rug zonder water en eten op je buik blijven liggen

1071836 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state

1071885 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama

1071913 i know the teams dont want to be seen as groveling around favre and begging him to come because of the impression it would leave about their incumbent quarterbacks but favres in a sensitive spot right now hes human hed like to be loved a little bit right now or at least gather some information so if he had to make a decision about whether to accept a trade hed know more than he knows now

1072096 i was just standing out there in the heat of the day and bleeding and trying to be quiet about it
1072097 i made a conscious effort to educate myself more deeply
1072098 i began to study race sexuality and gender with a hope to understand my own place in the world more clearly
1072099 youre going to this environment thinking youre going to make all this money
1072100 but youre going back to a system that is going to keep you down
1072101 it really did make me feel like i belonged somewhere and that i could be good at something
1072102 i think it was 20 minutes later after i was able to do it right
1072103 and i was so numb afterwards that i couldnt even say anything
1072104 i passed a dark corner somebody grabbed me and i was raped
1072105 it had to be one of the drill sergeants just the type of uniform that he had
1072106 they thought that that was the best thing for them to do to break me down
1072107 was to make myself tired enough where i couldnt think about things
1072108 i thought i was crazy and i didnt connect that to the rape
1072109 because i had such a great record and was one of the top soldiers in the service
1072110 that proved to them that this could not happen to me
1072111 you program individuals to go into the military but you dont deprogram them when they come out
1072112 they dont transition properly they just walk away and if you dont deal with it then it will manifest itself later on
1072113 you go you serve they honor you and you come back and then nobody talks about what happened
1072114 and the nearest va is maybe a hundred miles away so youre not going to go so yeah youre going to start drinking youre going to start acting out in other ways that are going to put you in prison
1072115 how do i hold the child that i left when i dont have arms
1072116 i was raised not really reflecting too much upon my own race and in fact there was actually shame involved around being different
1072117 i really wanted to prove that i was just as good and just as strong and just as capable as all the boys
1072118 all the reasons why women shouldnt be in the military
1072119 youre not capable you shouldnt be here youre holding us back
1072120 because i was 22 at the time and extremely confused and just really ashamed
1072121 the military reproduces the same socioeconomic inequalities that are in the civilian world
1072122 if given another chance i would do it all over again
1072123 i see all my experiences as opportunities for growth and change im the person i am today because of them
1072124 you really dont see the peace activists or the antiwar movement in south central l a
1072125 its very difficult for them to find a space to voice their experience even within the antiwar movement
1072126 the problem lies in the racism that is still in our nation the problem lies in the separation of issues
1072127 when i come upon a bad assonance or a repetition in my sentences im sure im floundering in the false by searching i find the proper expression which was always the only one and which is also harmonious the word is never lacking when one possesses the idea is there not in this precise fitting of parts something eternal like a principal if not why should there be a relation between the right word and the musical word or why should the greatest compression of thought always result in a line of poetry

1072168 motherhood is an adventure a white knuckle thrill ride soothed occasionally by heartwarming moments it seems that one minute we are new parents just home from the hospital wondering how on earth we will ever raise this newborn baby and the next minute were standing in the driveway waving good bye as junior drives off into the future

1072184 in fact whitney thinks the actual declines will be worse closer to 40 because of the loss of the securitization market and the paucity of mortgage credit available
1072185 the consumers ability to refinance his way out of trouble has diminished greatly
1072186 whitneys critics and there are many among bankers and analysts contend her bearishness at this point shows she simply doesnt now how to measure the remaining downside risk
1072187 her response if she has no idea how to properly value bank stocks now its because the metrics dont work price to earnings ratios are useless when earnings are nonexistent and valuing banks on price to book ratios is just as futile those book values which reflect underlying assets and liabilities are moving targets

1072204 fire extinguishers are haphazardly placed and sometimes even used as doorstops
1072205 in the event of an emergency without designated areas people would not be able to locate a fire extinguisher
1072206 these windows allow no privacy and may make female customers uncomfortable or unwilling to go to the restroom
1072207 an exhibition is for brands to showcase their new products not for sales
1072208 this will not help customers who need to withdraw money to make a purchase
1072209 i cant believe hes taking another trip to a foreign country
1072210 dont look at me i havent touched the stuff in years
1072211 he took everything you can possibly imagine he even sniffed cooking gas
1072212 the crime took place after hed been awake for four days using cocaine when the girl arrived he was using crack she picked up the telephone and said she was going to call the police and he had an attack of rage
1072213 they shot him in the leg the face it smashed his face
1072214 my son is not this monster that society thinks he is he always helped people he has a good heart
1072215 we express our deep sympathies to the family of benjamin and pray that god will give them comfort in this time of sorrow
1072216 at 27 calories and 2 2g of fiber of a recommended daily intake of 20g per 100g bamboo shoots provide a light good food source in summer especially when they are chilled and sliced after cooking
1072217 fibrous bamboo shoot can also balance out fats contained in contemporary diets
1072218 as a defense mechanism to avoid being eaten by animals bamboo shoots turn bitter when they break the soil which is a result of being in contact with the sun choosing bamboo shoots that do not have any greenness ensures they will be sweeter
1072219 as a rule of thumb choose ones that are short and stout
1072220 i think that were seeing graphically ps3 games starting to create some distance and some of the other competitors are going to feel that theyre getting long in the tooth looking quite dated because they havent created that ten year vision from a horsepower standpoint
1072221 were looking to convert the ps2 owners and the tens of millions of installed base that were playing dvds and playing games on their ps2 to now play blu ray movies and blu ray games with their ps3
1072222 i think the reality is that we will win hands down if we convert the ps2 owners to ps3
1072223 people were excited when the baseball team was in arizona
1072224 this was before we made it to the world series in omaha
1072225 i re ordered national championship shirts nearly 15 times the hats and t shirts are the hot items we needed to have a glory and it came at the perfect time its exciting to see the community behind the bulldogs
1072226 people love football and i think the craze will continue into august
1072227 we had to hire security the line after the baseball teams victory went for a solid eight hours one customer spent 1 400
1072228 roughly 35 of our total sales came off the web
1072229 i probably shipped something to almost every state in the country
1072230 there will be no signing tomorrow i got a call from the supreme court
1072231 the court issued a tro temporary restraining order restraining the respondents from signing the moa memorandum of agreement
1072232 do not build a berlin wall among the people in mindanao
1072233 view it very helpful in winning equal opportunity for asian americans in that event this convention may reconvene
1072234 im very disappointed that john mccain did not respond to our questionnaire
1072235 i know well probably pay more taxes but the most important thing for asian americans is equal opportunity and justice i hope during the next election the republican will do more for the asian american community
1072236 we have to separate the emotions from the brain side of it
1072237 my name is arthur cheung i dont have kids and im not married but i think the work we did here today will affect the future for my kids that i will have
1072238 sometimes its what you identify with some people identify with age some identify with gender high on my list is ethnicity
1072239 if you look at the increase in lithium prices over the past seven to 10 years its been dramatic
1072240 there are very limited global reserves and theyre in potentially very unstable parts of the world
1072241 that was the last time that an organization got together to do that type of research
1072242 there is no surplus lithium carbonate available for the automotive market its all being used by existing industrial applications
1072243 tahils argument that the world is short of lithium carbonate is wrong
1072244 tahil considers that the total world lithium reserves are 4 million tonnes
1072245 however sqms proven and probable in situ reserves alone total 5 million tonnes
1072246 theres a difference between long term availability and short term supply
1072247 there seems to have been a big change at the end of 2007
1072248 it seems to be largely due to the chinese theyre inputting their production capabilities and they may be releasing more stuff that was stockpiled
1072249 for those investments to be made folks have to have a degree of certainty that in fact this time these vehicles are going to happen and that oil prices or more particularly retail prices for petroleum products will remain high
1072250 youll have more efficient cars alternative fuel blended fuel then the hybrids and electric drives and all of them will have their piece of the wedge
1072251 i tried my best and im very impressed by how the low scores have been this week it was a great win for ji yai
1072252 i kept it together pretty well today but i was emotional on the first tee and coming up the final few holes i was pleased to play well and to break 70 for the first time this week i just wish the birdie putt at the last had been for the championship
1072253 w e must continue to advocate for reform and support indigenous agents of change in nondemocratic countries even as we cooperate with their governments on security
1072254 e ven as we worked with president pervez musharraf in fighting terrorists and extremists we invested more than us 3 billion to strengthen pakistani society
1072255 president george w bush declined to question his domestic policies or insist upon democracy
1072256 i think we all knew that there are so many and they are playing so well and consistently and working so hard
1072257 now we can see that the asian tour is becoming very strong the top players are coming to the states and they can also win in the states before it was a different story so the rest of us just need to prepare and continue working hard with so many more good players around
1072258 pak se ri she was my hero because of watching golf
1072259 im watching her then and watching her now and shes still my hero

1072262 the war on greenhouse gasses is too important to be left to the environmentalists
1072263 a manhattanites carbon footprint is 30 smaller than the average americans
1072264 a single organically raised cow puts out 16 percent more greenhouse gasses than its counterpart
1072265 over its lifetime a tree shifts from being a vacuum cleaner for atmospheric carbon to an emitter
1072266 pound for pound making a prius contributes more carbon to the atmosphere than making a hummer largely because of the nickel in the hybrids battery
1072267 if the new prius were placed head to head with a used car would the prius win dont bet on it making a prius consumes 113 million btus according to sustainability engineer pablo p ster a single gallon of gas costs about 113 000 btus so toyotas green wonder guzzles the equivalent of 1 000 gallons before it clocks its first mile a used car on the other hand starts with a significant advantage the first owner has already paid off its carbon debt buy a decade old toyota tercel which gets a respectable 35 mpg and the prius will have to drive 100 000 miles to catch up
1072268 only about one fourth of all medical schools in the us require medical students to take even one nutrition course less than half of medical programs even provide an elective nutrition course students in such classes receive less than twenty total hours of nutrition education an amount they themselves consider inadequate

1072270 the uses of enchantment the meaning and importance of fairy tales
1072271 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1072272 its a huge honor and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country they are big shoes that i have to fill but i will give it the best possible go it is a great honor it is something that has turned my life around in the last 24 hours it has been a very emotional time for me
1072273 time will tell but i hope it wont restrict the way i play ive been successful with my style and i would be foolish to change that
1072274 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
1072275 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
1072276 the loser is the clubs because we pay the players but dont get anything from them
1072277 no the loser is actually the people from fifa because they have shown themselves to be incapable in this whole affair
1072278 we still need to push very hard in the development of the car and the reliability but even in a worse case like this were still in the championship completely
1072279 were still in the fight well be pushing very hard over the break
1072280 we are very sad for felipe because he did in my view the best race of his career today
1072281 it was fantastic in the way he attacked and the way he managed the race so we are very disappointed for that
1072282 im in a very strong position in terms of me so i think im still growing a lot and learning race to race and that can help for the championship the confidence and thats the most important thing
1072283 i think for the moment everything is completely open we have three cars in a very small gap in terms of points
1072284 hes very strong for sure this kind of race if youre able mentally to manage after the disappointment you have you will only get stronger
1072285 and this is what were going to do together because that is the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia
1072286 when the track is clear we showed that we have the speed when there is traffic we cant take advantage
1072287 the olympics for many many years now has been circulating around marketing and sponsors tv and glamorous athletic stars and money the athens olympics contradicted that approach our olympics was also about culture peace and truce
1072288 the olympics are beautiful and this is the first time i can participate
1072289 i was shot at here by a sniper in this stadium and i wasnt killed because thank god i happened to be running
1072290 there were several assassination attempts on our way home car bombs and explosions
1072291 many times when we were driving home we were followed by gunmen who started shooting at us it was her insistence that pushed me to continue working with her she is really a brave girl
1072292 participation in the olympics means a lot to me because i will represent an entire country not just myself
1072293 when i heard about our elimination from the olympics on the television i cried for two and a half hours
1072294 i was so depressed because i felt that everything i had worked for under such difficult conditions had vanished but after we were allowed to participate in the games life came back to me i was as happy as child and during a party at my home my happiness was indescribable
1072295 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1072296 has come to soundtrack our lives like sonic wallpaper reports alan connor in
1072297 at least i am convinced that we have a very strong team for the olympics
1072298 im taking a lot of confidence from this win you expect to get that after winning your first big tournament
1072299 its different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you
1072300 he was making me do a lot unforced errors he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm today i had a great match last night i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14 we used to watch these kind of matches on television and now we are playing them
1072301 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
1072302 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us
1072303 i had to change something i played a bit more aggressive and served a little bit smarter than i had in the past and obviously it worked its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
1072304 its the first time in my life i have won tournaments back to back
1072305 usually i would win a tournament and the next week i would lose in the first round
1072306 i was happy when i won the first match and then i was just taking it one match at a time
1072307 i was pretty nervous in my first big final and i wished to play better
1072308 im kind of upset with how i played in the final i wanted to have a good match against dinara but i think she played really well i hope in my next final i will play better
1072309 winning in stockholm is completely perfect i feel at home and the spectators were rooting for me
1072310 that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
1072311 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour 136 8kph to hit somebody
1072312 ozzie doesnt play like that this team doesnt play like that
1072313 as more and more large local enterprises have begun to recruit talent by following foreign companies employee benefit systems foreign companies have gradually lost their attractiveness leaving only those that offer better future prospects
1072314 3ms patents in the industrial medical and optoelectronics industries are all major sources of export revenue for taiwan that is why our company is popular among local job seekers despite a lack of advertising
1072315 the sell through of diamond phones is very good demand is quite strong
1072316 the launch of iphone has not hurt our sales as some thought
1072317 it is not a problem for us to sell more than 2 million diamond phones by the end of the year we can reach the goal ahead of schedule
1072318 the display resolution smart dial feature user friendliness and 3 5g capability make it a more attractive alternative than apples iphone
1072319 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1072320 maybe they can write an album full of catchy radio rock this is great
1072321 i think were definitely bigger than the beatles now but its almost irrelevant because their music sounds so old and boring anyway
1072322 the love guru didnt work well because mike myers addresses a teenage audience and he was trying to mix it up with metaphysics
1072323 humor mixed with spirituality can work if its done well but frankly speaking this was not a good attempt
1072324 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
1072325 in 1975 the same way emergency was slapped on the nation media was forced to shut or praise govt common people were not allowed to walk freely on the streets amp democracy was hung now in jammu govt doing the same police attacked media brutally some were hospitalized tv cable newspaper offices were shut forcibly police even forcibly burnt the body of hindu youth kuldeep dogra with liquor amp beat up his family 2 more hindus are killed amp many injured
1072326 this is a conspiracy of jehadis hand in hand with the government to kick out amarnath amp hindus even from jammu now same way as they did in 1990 when 3 lakhs kasmiri hindus were forced out their daughters raped sons killed why was the army not sent on time there even today they are not relocated to their own homes land in kashmir amp now kasmiri muslims helped by the govt doing same with amarnath land amp jammu too instead of helping hindus govt using police amp got the army in jammu to terrorise hindus
1072327 omar abdullah said that not even an inch land will be given to amarnath omar must know that exactly 5000 years from now kauravas said the same to shrikrishna that they would not give even the needle point land to pandavas jammu still has the pandav gufa amp hindus still have the blessings of shivji amp shrikrishna omar or any muslim does not own any land of hindu temples teerths amp surrounding jungles rivers seas amp hills anywhere in kashmir or india it belongs to that hindu deity as hindu religion amp deities came in much before islam was even born huriyat amp other such outfits or any govt have no right to tell hindus when where how to do yaatras amp how to worship if they interfere in hindu faith then all india hindus would be forced to ask them how not to do noise pollution 5 times a day with loud ajan from mosques or how not to block roads crouching for namaz on streets or how not to use ajmer land haji malang hill amp jungle near mumbai haji ali sea in mumbai char minar streets in hyderabad or kashi lane near ganga amp kashi vishwanath govts must stop meddling in hindu faith by helping jehadis instead govt better focus on hanging jehadi afzal on controlling jehadi terrorism that kills hundreds in india every month

1072329 taiwan is still a very export oriented economy and with export growth looking to slow down it will start impacting on the taiwan dollar
1072330 the risk of an export slowdown in taiwan has heightened
1072331 the spending plan will not be able to offset falling demand from the us and other trade partners
1072332 the government is poorly equipped in the battle against imported inflation as the country has no control over global oil or food prices
1072333 although the actual price cut depends on various factors the ministry has asked the industrial development bureau to negotiate with local business operators to first cut flour prices
1072334 didier will not play in our first game against portsmouth and will probably miss the second against wigan if there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that
1072335 but when you have a knee injury you just never know
1072336 initial tests show serious damage to his knee ligaments but the player will undergo complementary exams including an mri on monday to determine the full extent of the injury
1072337 kenwynes going in tomorrow for an operation and we will know in 24 hours of the exact damage so fingers crossed
1072338 as the global economy becomes more uncertain customers are more cautious about placing orders and aggressive in inventory control

1072346 nearly every single possible combination of the childrens meals at kfc taco bell sonic jack in the box and chick fil a is too high in calories
1072347 ninety three percent of 1 474 possible choices at the 13 chains exceed 430 calories an amount that is one third of what the institute of medicine recommends that children aged four through eight should consume in a day
1072348 chilis has 700 possible kids meal combinations but 658 or 94 percent of those are too high in calories including one comprised of country fried chicken crispers cinnamon apples and chocolate milk 1 020 calories and another comprised of cheese pizza home style fries and lemonade 1 000 calories
1072349 there are things we need to go through and from that conversation we will move forward
1072350 with brett coming back if they do open it up to a competition then i get a chance to compete

1072356 we know that this software exists in very critical infrastructures in the u s
1072357 through his research wes demonstrated how it was possible to obtain unauthorized access to the control system in just a few seconds
1072358 he then discovered how to break every encoded password in the system and how to bypass password security altogether
1072359 wes is one of the most technical students we have and a real asset to the department of computer science and engineering
1072360 he now also has proven himself to be an asset to the federal government

1072366 hardly a day has passed without mats sundin being mentioned in newspapers everywhere as well as being a favourite topic among talking heads on television and radio
1072367 my choice is scotty bowmans decision to join the chicago blackhawks as their senior advisor of hockey operations
1072368 the reason while the sundin story is all about money bowmans is all about family its about what really matters its about scottys son stan 35 whos entering his second season as assistant general manager in chicago its about a father supporting his son on the ice and a lot more off it
1072369 earned the right to pick his favorite ending to be closer to his family to take on one more big challenge
1072370 scotty told me probably over a year ago that he might go to chicago but not to say anything about it in respect to the red wings and his son
1072371 don t kid yourself scotty still knows more about what s going on in the game in his little pinkie than 95 percent of the rest of the current gms in the league the blackhawks just got a lot better with his arrival
1072372 average goals game totals fell during this period from 95 96 first full year after strike it was a lockout cynical joe sh of 6 29 g gm fairly steadily to the low of 5 14g gm in 03 04 last season before lockout the 5 14 goal average per game was less than the oilers used to score on their own at the height of gretzky era
1072373 i think its a good project and it will need time to reap its rewards theyve taken a few steps but it will need five or six years for the league to develop to say the level of the nhl
1072374 i dont really read the american press to be honest
1072375 internet cloud based development and use of computer technology computing
1072376 comes from characteristics that simply cannot be replicated internally like not having to engineer for peak loads and being able to build on top of the ecosystems existing services yes you can build a cloud computing
1072377 most people who consume alcohol in the united states drink in ways that may increase their risk of the metabolic syndrome and related conditions
1072378 prevention efforts should focus on reducing alcohol consumption to safer levels
1072379 unfortunately few physicians screen their patients about alcohol use or are knowledgeable about guidelines that define low risk or moderate drinking

1072381 i almost dont care whats going on this show is so beautiful to look at you could just hit the mute button and just lose yourself in the cinematography and styling

1072383 i dont know how to say this without sounding naive but you fooled me
1072384 im in the persuasion business and i find your pitch really disappointing
1072385 will there be an eruption its who will blow up and melt down first
1072386 after much deliberation and careful thought quinn resolved to retire from the nfl
1072387 people think i am and theyll start saying stuff ill start nodding my head and pretend i know
1072388 we want to leave the door open for him because i have been aware of people changing their minds
1072389 we told him to take as much time as he needed
1072390 people probably think im crazy when i say it but chris wells is the closest thing to jim brown that ive ever seen
1072391 that says a whole lot i know but i really believe it
1072392 i want the person whos deserving of winning the heisman trophy to win the heisman trophy
1072393 i certainly want beanie to have a great season because hes here at ohio state and i know him extremely well but i also want to make sure that he has the season thats deserving of winning it if hes going to win it and the same thing with tebow
1072394 mainly its his speed his strength and the way that he brushes people off of him
1072395 people can hit him and just fall off of him
1072396 its almost comical when you watch it because it seems like people try to get to him and he just brushes them off of him with that stiff arm thats one of the reasons i say he really reminds me of jim brown
1072397 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all

1072400 two things we said when we got back from california one we said guys when you watch the tape youre going to be really disappointed we didnt play the way were capable of playing and the no 2 thing is we know what people are saying
1072401 thats why if we can take a freshman class and go all four years and win then you can say youve turned the corner
1072402 what you have to take into perspective as a reporter is find out when those games were scheduled
1072403 the reason i scheduled cal poly was because before we play michigan ohio state and penn state back to back this season i was set to play virginia tech and that didnt seem like a good idea for me when you have those games i got out of playing virginia tech
1072404 the reason i think weve been successful is because weve had good scheduling
1072405 as i travel minnesota i feel the states pain and the fact that we havent represented the big ten in a long time in pasadena thats a tremendous challenge for me our staff and our school without question we believe we can make an impact in the big ten
1072406 when i arrived in 1993 if we would have had six wins then we would have had a parade down central street we wouldve shut it down and had a purple party in chicago
1072407 but things have changed its taken 13 years and were not where we need to be
1072408 if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 percent or so still is very useful for us
1072409 we understand they are disappointed because they had been awaiting for the approval but did not obtain it within the time of period they expected
1072410 but china oriental and arcelormittal have so far never talked about giving up raising the stake
1072411 theres going to be greater use of port facilities expansions are under way so its a growth area
1072412 thered be further upside id say to bed it down
1072413 its a multi player online game set in the world of the spy agency that trained bourne
1072414 we expect the company will achieve tremendous success from the upcoming metallica expansion pack which will likely attach 20 percent of the installed base implying nearly 5 million units or 250 million in sales
1072415 we expect the company will release at least 3 expansion packs for guitar hero iv before the next iteration of the franchise
1072416 ultimately the game could produce a legitimate medium for artists enabling music creation marketing and distribution
1072417 while i can claim no credit for the success the students have been having i am very proud of this team and previous teams which are bringing name and fame to missouri state university
1072418 we were very happy with how we did at the competition and overall the project was a success
1072419 it would be natural for hsbc to try to renegotiate the price given the market conditions
1072420 as much as hsbc is determined to buy keb its also true that the current price is too high
1072421 we dont lose anything by being patient to get the deal done
1072422 the stock price can go up and down but the overall value of korea exchange bank has increased over the years
1072423 as long as wall street remains unstable taiwan cannot isolate itself from volatility suffered by global markets in the near term
1072424 i do not rule out the possibility that the weighted index will test 6 800 points again this week
1072425 the environment has become more difficult and will probably remain that way
1072426 that refers to the more pessimistic outlook on the economy in general the impact of the credit turmoil continuing for the sector and also to the acceleration of inflation in europe
1072427 its iran again the iranian issue remains fluid and it looks like more sanctions will be imposed by the world powers and they will likely raise tensions over iran
1072428 some reports are saying much of the us offshore oil production facilities are in the likely path of the storm but it is a little too early to say what the direction of the storm is going to be
1072429 if at first you dont succeed youre not chuck norris

1072431 norse legend tells that odin lord of the gods was attended by two ravens named hugin thought and munin memory who served him as reconnaissance agents returning after each long snoopy flight to perch on his shoulders and whisper into his ears
1072432 polly put the kettle on hurrah polly put the kettle on and well all have tea grip grip grip grip the clever grip the wicked grip the knowing
1072433 the ravens croaking might have been prophetically heard in the course of the drama
1072434 be less destructive in his criticism and concentrate on his poetry
1072435 willis was right and within a few months the poem was published in numerous journals and was a high society sensation
1072436 the ravens would fly along with hunting parties and make a wing dipping move to signal the hunters toward caribou so that the hunt would be successful and everyone humans and birds would tuck into a bounteous feast
1072437 here comes poe with his raven like barnaby rudge three fifths of him genius two fifths sheer fudge
1072438 in sweden ravens are known as the ghosts of murdered people and in germany as the souls of the damned in danish folklore a raven that ate a kings heart gained human knowledge could perform great malicious acts led people astray and had superhuman powers
1072439 edgar allan poe is dead he died in baltimore the day before yesterday this announcement will startle many but few will be grieved by it

1072463 lord if youre ever feeling proud of me just for a fleeting moment could we kind of keep it between the two of us
1072464 the lord does not see as man sees for man looks at the outward appearance but the lord looks at the heart

1072489 just like you didnt come down here and tell everyone that tony her husband the coach asked you to come and scout for him
1072490 you thought we were making it up that they have an unreasonable hate of us and our kid
1072491 he just shook his head just then the director in question walked by almost as if it were scripted i ask him why he is telling untruths he sputters and hems and haws and finally said someoine else told him i said that and litterally runs away i tell his retreating back it is a damn lie

1072496 if people are around the riff raff dont raise their heads

1072500 the tia have committed to having a serious consideration of it and i welcome that feedback i have been talking to various sector groups floating it theres been better than 50 support but the industry needs to embrace this wholeheartedly
1072501 any major division on it means firstly governments not going to implement it and secondly that would cause rumbles across the industry that wouldnt help
1072502 retail investors get access to liquidity first however if all the retailers decide to go at the same time well have to close it completely
1072503 it is feeding on itself and it will have to work its way out there is nowhere to hide right now apart from cash you have to call it a crisis of confidence

1072510 el hecho de comenzar a editar nuestras propias grabaciones tuvo mucho que ver con el hecho de crear nuestra propia libertad con hacer exactamente lo que quisi ramos hacer de vivir nuestra fe en dios era nuestra oportunidad de aprender m s de llegar a donde pudi ramos a una compa a grande por nosotros mismos la desventaja creo es que nunca ten amos tanto tiempo para grabar como tenemos ahora con atlantic nos han proporcionado un gran presupuesto y hemos podido disponer de mucho m s tiempo esa financiaci n nos ha servido para conseguir una buena grabaci n cosa que no fue posible en las cuatro grabaciones anteriores por no disponer de tanto tiempo
1072511 era nuestro dinero y siempre est bamos tenemos que hacer tenemos que hacer pero todo esto nos ayud a desarrollar la banda de un modo underground con nuestros propios fans movi ndolo hemos tocado en cantidad de sitios diferentes y en cada sitio donde toc bamos por todo el pa s aparec an los muchachos y vend amos discos en la trasera del coche y esto nos ha ayudado para fichar por una gran compa a teniendo cuatro discos anteriores tambi n ten amos como una fundaci n de gente que le gusta nuestra m sica
1072512 llevar la distribuci n nosotros mismos era un trabajo duro
1072513 as que una vez que firmamos todos esos muchachos fueron a las tiendas a comprar el disco y crearon una chispa mayor en la industria p o d salt a las listas y la gente preguntaba de d nde vienen p o d as que todo ello revirti en nuestro beneficio fue trabajo aprendizaje y firmar con atlantic ha mejorado nuestra distribuci n
1072514 no simplemente hicimos lo que hicimos para conseguir poder negociador as que no hemos sacrificado nada por firmar con atlantic porque ten amos tantas cosas en movimiento antes de firmar que el hecho de firmar nos permiti expandito antes de firmar que el hecho de firmar nos permiti expandirnos
1072515 nos permiti que la gente supiera lo que est bamos haciendo simplemente ellos tienen m s presupuesto para marketing y para situarte en un mejor lugar as que no hemos sacrificado nada al firmar por una gran compa a vamos a seguir hablando de lo que hablamos sobre el amor a dios vamos a entregar nuestras canciones a dios y nadie podr cambiar eso de nosotros
1072516 creo que el positivismo creo que el mundo est cansado de ver esas bandas heavies cantando voy a matarme o dr gate los miembros de p o d han estado all lo han visto y hemos salido de eso dios cambi nuestras vidas y nuestros corazones y nuestra vida es mejor ahora queremos transmitir a los muchachos s feliz dios puede cambiar tu vida no tienes por qu ser totalmente religioso pero si le das tu coraz n l te aceptar tal y como eres aunque tengas tatuajes pendientes o trenzas dios ama a todo el mundo si escuchas nuestras canciones lo que decimos a la gente b sicamente amaos unos a otros tratamos de ser lo mejores posible y la forma de hacerlo es pedirle a dios que ponga amor en nue nuestros corazones y por eso cuando escuchas las canciones de p o d te sientes bien y las letras definen al cien por cien lo que sentimos
1072517 traemos un bagaje positivo al mundo lo que nos hace diferentes de lo que hab a hasta ahora
1072518 eso nos hace tocar todav a m s porque hemos descubierto que nuestra fe es tan aut ntica para nosotros que nos da la motivaci n m s importante para tocar
1072519 escuchamos todo lo que puedas e puedas imaginar podemos escuchar a frank sinatra
1072520 y quince minutos despu s podemos estar escuchando algo de hip hop jazz de todo reggae
1072521 escuchamos todo tipo de m sica al principio cuando est bamos formando el grupo escuch bamos bandas a las que segu amos como bad brains tambi n podr amos hablar de carlos santana
1072522 desde que somos un grupo hemos aceptado un mont n de estilos de los otros y hemos escuchado tanto los gustos de los dem s que hemos aprendido a disfrutar de los estilos musicales del resto de los miembros del grupo cuando formamos el grupo de tocar unos con otros hemos aprendido muchos los unos de los otros y de sus gustos lo bueno de esto es que hemos llegado a asimilar el hecho de que no tenemos l mites no tocamos un estilo espec fico de m sica
1072523 ninguno de nosotros creci en familias religiosas llegamos a conocer a dios individualmente en nuestros propios caminos sonny habla de experiencias personales de la vida tribal habla de todo un colectivo de gente que son como guerreros que tratan de amar a dios en este mundo sa es una de nuestras ventajas que conectamos con gente espiritual ellos aman a dios y cuando nos ven tocar quieren seguir amando a dios y est n en este mundo tratando de ser guerreros soldados tribales tratando de hacer el bien cuando el mundo entero est vuelto hacia el odio crean o no en dios el mundo est lleno de odio por eso tenemos una banda tratando de salir ah y decirle a la gente que se animenmen a unirse a algo que es real intentar ser positivo es todo lo que tratamos de hacer y no hay nadie m s haci ndolo
1072524 es un tema incre ble de un grupo fant stico
1072525 u2 es una banda a quien siempre hemos admirado especialmente marcos que le encanta the edge y hace ruidos del mismo estilo como l as que a marcos le encantaba la idea y al resto de la banda tambi n admiramos su integridad como banda son tambi n positivos y tienen una fuerte integridad como banda de modo que cogimos el tema y en vez de reproducirlo ntegramente lo hicimos m s p o d un poco m s pesada siempre hab amos querido hacerlo y al firmar con atlantic ten amos suficiente tiempo en el estudio as que lo hicimos adem s es la nica versi n que tocamos en el repertorio y la tocaremos esta noche
1072526 ya ten amos un single funcionando ndr outkast y antes de venir aqu lanzamos el segundo video que corresponde al segundo single que es uno de los grandes temas del disco rock the party off the hook que puede gustar a un tipo m s general de gente as que veremos qu pasa

1072530 hes been good for us and good for the boys too having to deal with someone from a different culture
1072531 his command of english is ok and a lot of the rugby terminology is universal anyway its more the detail stuff thats a bit more difficult hes energetic he certainly likes the physical side of the game and he just needs to find a balance between the two in terms of when he goes into contact and when he stays out on his wing
1072532 he recovered very good he does not need any treatment now he is active to the people he knows but he is quiet when he see strangers
1072533 i did find them on that website at us675 and decided no im glad i did
1072534 i had some suspicions about it especially having heard that these tickets were only available through accredited agencies and tickets werent actually leaving beijing you had to pick them up there the usa site just didnt ring true to me and i dont have a spare us675 anyway
1072535 that site www beijingticketing com is the biggest scam in the world
1072536 they are based out of arizona somewhere and are being sued by the united states olympic committee if they can even find them they are a complete fraud and anybody who gave them money off their website to unofficial people really are taking a hell of a risk
1072537 where people lose money we obviously have huge regrets about it where we have heard that people have gone elsewhere and got caught we have made every effort to get them tickets and have done so
1072538 we have managed to get a lot of the parents that have had problems sorted out but we wouldnt know how many there are because they wouldnt all come to us they might feel so ashamed they dont want to do anything so we dont know how widespread the effect is
1072539 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can

1072567 news international are the power brokers because the key to everything in the states is being able to get onto television we know that americans love the game when they see it on television but getting onto tv is difficult wed need to televise the games at a cost of 350 000 per game the figures still stack up though and while wed need to start off with a team full of kiwis south africans and australians and perhaps even players from europe argentina and the pacific islands young american players would soon come through and would benefit from playing alongside these guys
1072568 the two systems are all but mutually exclusive for any number of reasons and there are at least two reasons to reach consensus first at present america doesnt have 60 young i e less than 25 years old players who project to the international level let alone the 90 needed for 3 teams second neither the na4 nor the all americans are currently generating cash for a union thats dependent on dues and overseas largesse
1072569 teams arent willing to use one of their non ec player exemptions on him hes not good enough for one of these roster spots kiwis aussies and south africans get them italy or france doesnt even have a place for him hes not going to the uk
1072570 if you say so flynn im sure they can contact petris agent im sure he has one with all these offers on the table fyi rhys webb is 19 years old and considered to be a real challenger for the position regardless of who they sign it is rumored that marshall was making 200k pounds per year per the bbc so they have a talented person in their academy and they have the money they could go after anyone they wanted to go after

1072598 pbs has become much too opinionated when it comes to politics
1072599 the agenda here is blatantly biased against the entire war and this white house
1072600 enough is enough you may not continue to do what you are doing we will not allow the bullies to run rampant in the schoolyard we will not tolerate the inhumanity
1072601 every day we just try to get better and it would be garbage now to think that we cannot improve so i will be relentless in the pursuit of improvements and i will impress that upon the guys strongly and i think that everyone takes that approach
1072602 you can always get better we led the first race but matador were going well and we chose the deeper of our two jibs for that second beat and the breeze built a little which was a bit difficult then matador are fast down wind and slipped past us there but always our mode is consistency and good sailing and we talked through the things we can do better technically driving the boat downwind communication understand what the guy is saying sail calls bottom mark decision little incremental improvements to work on
1072603 im happy we are sailing well but im not relaxing either im very respectful as always of our competitors so i just know we have to keep the whole thing moving forward
1072604 it is a lot tighter than it has been in previous years there are any number of good boats out there and you look at what happened to mean machine in marseille and to them yesterday that is an unfortunate day but they are an excellent team and i know they will keep fighting through to the end of the year but that is capable of happening to any boat in this fleet it could be us tomorrow it could be quantum
1072605 the level on the race course is most definitely higher we have had the proof of that with our boat which is the same as last year but we have had to raise our speed target since we are sailing faster and faster by the day the boat is sailing at least three tenths of a knot faster upwind than last year which is about 4 faster a huge difference in this kind of fleet that makes the difference of whether you cross a boat or can get to the more favoured side you can also see how the boats in the fleet that havent been able to do the whole circuit are paying the price for it because being able to keep up the rhythm and spending hours on the water with these people is what makes it easier for us to keep bringing up our own level as well
1072606 we have to work on the starts and speed and not make silly mistakes we are definitely in the top group for speed get off the line in clean air we are sometimes a bit conservative which takes us away from the favoured side you have to weigh up if you go for the risky move or the safe option sometimes when the course is so favoured the risky move is still the safe option its a real tricky balance
1072607 we had a bit of strife in the last race when we got tied up with cristabella and desafio and they fouled us pretty bad but we had a good last run and we were able to get a decent result we gybed at the buoy and were able to take the pressure down low and then we gybed early and were headed and so we got the fast mode all the way to the finish and took some more boats it headed about 15 degrees and so we are back up to second overall on the standings and that is a relief after marseille to be back to up to second from disastrous regatta in marseille to be back here is good quantum are just playing mr consistent which is the way to win events today it was important to get good starts and choose the correct side the right was favoured especially
1072608 we made a couple of mistakes over the day but it was good in the first race we went hard left on the first leg but we were able to come back on the last run so we saved the race
1072609 we stayed low and pushed them to the left corner and managed to get down inside them and so when they gybed we were on their wind we gybed back again and forced them to the corner and on the last time we were on their wind and able to roll them
1072610 it is about averages about keeping single digit finishes tomorrow will be an important race and the final results will start to emerge and so we hope we can keep this up every time we have a good start and have boat speed we are able to do well
1072611 we had a good start to the day and just couldnt keep it going an average second a bad start to the third and just never really quite got back into it a tough day and frustrating but the boat is going well and we are sailing it well we just have to try and capitalise a bit more when we have the opportunities
1072612 in every race we have been able to put our finger on one thing or other we can improve but it is so close with some huge competition and after the start today being so good we just couldnt quite repeat it
1072613 we need a good race tomorrow to get ourselves back into it today was disappointing for a number of reasons but tomorrow if we can bounce back with good results well be right there again
1072614 but we already had this conversation mamma and yesterday you said yes we could buy that
1072615 the great satan hisself is red and scaly with a bifurcated tail and he carries a hay fork
1072616 the first beat was really difficult we wanted to go left like everybody did but we decided that there was slightly better wind pressure up the middle of the course we got a great start out of the middle of the line blew off everyone to the right of us and were living well above everyone to leeward and then it went quite left and we could not live with it and made big losses but we stuck it out and lived with it a minute or so making big losses tacked over with a really great lane to the right suddenly all the guys to the left of us were in no pressure and we were right back in the hunt we were winning we were deep we were winning all on the first beat it was about shifts and pressure the rest of the day went pretty much exactly to plan
1072617 in fact everything we said in the forecast and the geography of the day happened i have never been so right about the wind and what was going to happen geographically in any race in ant regatta it did exactly what we expected it to do going light as it did last year with that big light patch around portals and increasing as you go across the bay to arenal that was the breeziest part of the day when you have that left hand sea breeze blowing like it did today then the right hand corner is always light morgan larson unbelievably had never sailed here before so he brings fresh eyes to it he can be a bit more open minded about it it was a really good combination today we needed to get a good result and unfortunately for mean machine they did not have a great day but obviously a very good points wise for us but you would not wish it on any one but it helps in the overall and in the regatta
1072618 at the start we wanted the left side of the course and we wanted the code zero to get there but unfortunately you lose a little bit of manoeuvrability so we got buried there pretty badly but going the right way we thought and probably the fleet thought too but when the breeze started going right then that was pretty much against anything that we had thought about and that put us pretty deep we fought our way up the second beat and then it went left and we were just on the wrong side most of the day the shame is that this is a double points and races you cant discard and we had got so far back up the circuit leader board as well but thats harsh it about these coastal races but that is the rules and we all know it and then once you do get behind after the first windward leeward it just gets to be a bit of a one way track there is not a lot of coming back
1072619 so we just need to wear this like we did in marseille and start winning a few inshore races we seem to be used to coming back and all you need is one good day again to get rolling some of these guys today are feeling pretty good about themselves after having a good day and we have been there so all you need is one good day but for us it is pretty hard to look at these points from today and figure out what to do i think these two days in marseille and here will prove importantif any team can come back from this then its this one as a crew well be out there fighting tomorrow like we always are the boat is going well and we are sailing it well and that hasnt changed
1072620 we probably saw a variance of up to five knots over the race course at times so it was really vital to be able to change gears a lot the trimming team did a really good job of keeping the boat powered up in the lulls and peter did a really good job of starting we had two good starts at the pin end and a very good start between artemis and quantum at the windward we had really good speed the boat seems to go well in the light air as we did in alicante we have learned a lot since she was new and we were fast in alicante and fast here probably especially downwind
1072621 the overall feeling today is obviously positive i am very happy we have started the regatta so well and two times out of three we started well and in the race we started bad we were in the right position we have always understood well how the wind shifts here and the boat speed in particular is a result in part to a new set up of the mast that we are testing for a light wind and waves part of our success today is due to the speed of the boat and partly the way we sailed the wind shifts
1072622 it was a good recovery in that first race in fact every time we did something well someone would tack on us and send us back which i guess is a complement but we did really nice work in the last half of the last run to pass four boats so that was really good the next two races the other positive was we bounced back strong we highlighted a couple of things in our strategies prior to this i didnt have a good start which was part of it and we were a little impatient with a couple of things we were eight points out of lead but it is good to see that the boat and changes with the sails and stuff have all been good steps forward plenty of racing to go
1072623 it has been the best start to the season so far lets hope it continues today we made some changes once again on board with a few new sails and the set up of the mast based on the data we have from last year as we have sailed really well in palma in the past fortunately it seems to still be working we hope that continues to be the case for the rest of the week palma is our home the boat is comfortable in these waters and so are we and i suppose that has its positive influence on us
1072624 id love to win the gold and silver breitling trophy a silver and gold cap again i think the cap suits me joking today was a nerve racking day with light airs and quite puffy and shifty but we had a good couple of starts we tried to play the game conservatively and it worked very well we had two starts on the pin which in itself is not conservative but there was a big hole and then relied on our boat speed from there we sailed nicely in phase for all three races we like being in palma a smaller scaled venue its a relaxing environment and i think that gives you a nice mental ease

1072660 god is seeking to enter the heart of every person on this planet but he faces a significant obstacle the problem has never been the message we have that straight for the most part nor is gods problem the lack of an audience plenty of people need to hear the good news his problem is the reluctant army he calls the church god is looking for people who are willing to participate in acts of love and kindness to those outside of their present circle he is looking for people who believe that a humble demonstration of love plants a seed of eternity in the hearts of others that will blossom into faith in christ

1072711 the issue anne points out appears to be that soa is still siloed within the it organization and the transformative effects have not yet spread to the business line of business managers she observes are not ready to share services the crux of soa value anne says so far she has only come across one company that has been able to connect soa success to business success through the establishment of strong positive and negative incentives that encourage people to adopt a better attitude toward sharing
1072712 since soa is seismological consider that it is an inevitability but only if you look at it in the geological time scale woa is sociological and therefore has a greater chance of establishing momentum in the short term what remains to be seen is if woa soa and poa emerge as a postmodern rethinking of the role of technology in business

1072721 a lot of people like the concept of governance and having policies but its not necessarily practical all by itself for the way businesses construct and leverage applications this happens because soa governance without validation doesnt provide any assurance that its actually meeting the business requirements set forth in the policies in essence it is like posting a speed limit but not having the radar gun to ensure that drivers are obeying the rules of the road

1072755 kosovars used to identify with the palestinians because we albanians are muslims and christians and we saw serbia and israel both as usurpers of land
1072756 then we looked at a map and woke up israelis have a population of six million their backs to the sea and 300 million arab enemies albanians have a total population of eight million our backs to the sea and 200 million slav enemies so why should we identify with the arabs
1072757 in albania and kosovo we are in support of israel i would never side with the muslim side to wipe israel off the face of the world 90 of kosovo feels this way the reason why is we sympathize a lot with the people who have suffered the same fate as us we were muslims even in the second world war stronger muslims than we are now but even then we protected them with our lives our grandfathers protected the jews wherever they were in the region
1072758 drop the passengers and go away we dont need you here

1072764 headwinds to the economy havent diminished and are possibly getting worse setting the stage for a lengthy period of weakness like that seen in the early 1990s
1072765 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
1072766 is israels lifeblood no one understands this better than israels enemies that is precisely why they still engage in a systematic campaign to erase the historical link of the jews to this great city for if israel were severed from jerusalem the jewish state would lose its sense of legitimacy and its will to fight only then could israel be destroyed
1072767 we were in shock when we heard about the rumors and could not stop laughing if they had been conceived by ivf we would have been happy to discuss it

1072800 and then the doctor will come to your room to talk with you
1072801 so get over yourself nothing scary is going to happen now because your life has already dealt with that this will be simple and straightforward you narcissist this has nothing to do with you its just medical and it will be fine so stop over dramatizing even in your own head your life is not les mis
1072802 i just am im going to say or do the wrong thing im going to wait on you too much or not enough im going to ask you if theres anything else i can do im going to be annoying im learning here and im not a mind reader so just tell me and i wont be offended
1072803 i dont want to discuss this its the last discussion were having about my health everything is going to be fine and i dont want us living our lives around thursday enough im fine i dont want to talk about it
1072804 okay how about this we only discuss it when you bring it up okay
1072805 see what youre dealing with now is karma ha you really are a greek tragedy
1072806 the comments on your site really made me feel hopeful and better about the whole situation since i have no experience with cardio stuff
1072807 oh because at st davids we dont do heart transplants
1072808 well we need to do a heart biopsy and the ones who do that are the doctors who handle transplants
1072809 but im also not just going in there until you know the risks so in a transplant patient to do a biopsy of the heart to see if theyre rejecting it isnt a big deal but with you phil the risk is five fold and its by no means a simple little procedure if you want i can go in there and biopsy but when i do that the heart can tear and make a hole which well isnt good see the heart is like fajitas
1072810 you know how a flank steak can just tear well essentially im going in there and taking bites out of your heart im telling you all of this because you need to know the risks and some people would rather not have the biopsies theyd rather not know whats going on
1072811 because given all you have atrial fibrillation complete stage three heart block and most concerning in all of this a very low velocity and very erratic heart trace something is wrong and very abnormal something bigger is probably going on now usually you have symptoms you come in complaining about your gallbladder or something and we narrow it down to the heart but everything about this situation is well something weve never seen before
1072812 if we do the biopsy hopefully well be able to rule out certain heart diseases namely myocarditis but other things as well the bad thing with doing a biopsy aside from the risks involved with tearing is that sometimes a biopsy yields nothing
1072813 is you might not like the results i might tell you that you have something that cannot be cured that even a transplant wont fix and some people dont want that kind of knowledge so they elect not to do the biopsy ill let you two talk it over
1072814 well on monday we might have some preliminaries back but thursday is the gold standard of results that is our best indicator
1072815 yes i have something for a nurse to pick up

1072903 dios padre celestial parece decir a toda la creaci n es bueno que t existas
1072904 como una gran acci n de gracias a dios padre en primer lugar y a nuestros propios padres en segundo t rmino porque si no se hubieran animado a tener una familia grande todos esos d cimos no hubieran estado all presentes
1072905 se aprende casi necesariamente a compartir a esperar a tolerar la frustraci n y postergar la gratificaci n actitudes tan necesarias hoy en d a y tan mencionadas por los psic logos a valorar cada vida humana como un precioso regalo de dios padre a aprender que con poco uno se puede conformar porque lo importante y necesario no es lo que el mundo te ofrece como imprescindible sino la presencia del que tienes al lado
1072906 hoy es cada vez mayor el miedo a no poder dar lo imprescindible desde lo material el mundo rechaza a las familias numerosas y a veces son muy atacadas como si fueran una gran locura pero los que se deciden a armar una familia grande necesariamente tienen puesta su mirada en lo alto creyendo que es m s valiosa la existencia de un nuevo miembro y el hecho de poder darle un hermano a los otros hijos que lo material que no pudieran llegar a tener
1072907 en el mundo hay mucho miedo al hijo por motivos diversos pero te idos quiz s de cierto ego smo pues en la cultura posmoderna en que vivimos el placer es priorizado sobre el valor de la vida y obviamente tener un hijo implica responsabilidades que necesariamente deben postergar nuestros propios intereses moment neos
1072908 no hay gratificaci n laborar ni personal que compense la alegr a de ser colaborador de la obra creadora de dios
1072909 encontrar el tiempo para atender a cada uno personalmente sin masificar diferenciar a cada uno sin generalizar no hay recetas y suponemos que cada familia sigue su propio estilo pero se debe priorizar el tiempo de la familia y para estar en familia
1072910 el secreto se alaron radica en vivir cada d a como si fuera el nico obviamente cada etapa de la vida tiene sus caracter sticas y a veces no se puede decir en algunos momentos soy feliz pero a la larga uno eval a que son mayores los beneficios en todo sentido que las carencias que se pueden haber sufrido

1072918 solo la fuerza del jes s y de su evangelio son capaces de transformar de forma definitiva la ra z de los males que nos aquejan solo l es capaz de transformar el coraz n humano del que tantas veces arrancan los ego smos que se encuentran en el origen de las diversas esclavitudes y en el cu l sin embargo se encuentra tambi n la libertad para responder al amor nico principio perdurable de un orden nuevo un mundo nuevo hecho de hombres nuevos

1072989 birax will hopefully be a long running program to strengthen the existing ties between britain and israel
1072990 because of the ongoing discussion of boycotts the british government decided that the most appropriate response was to strengthen research ties
1072991 by choosing starting academics when the unions start discussing a boycott there will be more people who have had some contact with israel and will have some knowledge weve discovered that 80 percent of those who attend the union meetings dont know anything about israel or the issue so its sort of a value added element to the program

1073007 movies into which huge amounts of money are poured in an effort to turn zionist themes into entertainment include movies created for children and youth
1073008 many films from the 1960s and 1970s indirectly convey the notion that the jews were oppressed this is conveyed through the themes of distance from the motherland and the search for ones mother who symbolizes the motherland these messages were gradually introduced into animation and childrens films
1073009 these people never make a film without a premeditated motive
1073010 two emotional themes can be identified in childrens films especially animation one is the lost mother and the other is the lost land there is also the lost dog these three themes frequently appear in animation produced since the 1970s
1073011 even though chicken run is a sort of fantasy about an animal farm on a deeper level it depicts the zionists favorite themes which appear in many of the visual dramas of the 20th century the recreation of a kind of genocide using visual elements reminiscent of nazi germany death camps an idea linked to the religious themes of a savior and immigration to a promised land serves a propaganda machine whose goal is to depict itself as a symbol for the oppressed and for those who suffer
1073012 in chicken run for example you find allusions to the holocaust to concentration camps and to the concept of awaiting a hero or a savior it portrays efforts to escape a predetermined fate the death of all those who lived in that camp who are depicted as chickens eventually a kind of noahs ark is built in this case a flying ship which is used for their escape
1073013 unfortunately zionist notions can be detected in childrens movies from the days of walt disney and tv animation films the zionists exclusive investment in groups specializing in childrens films such as dreamworks in the 1990s and the appearance of various works like chicken run which employed magnificent techniques were part of their premeditated plan to cover the bloodstains soiling the clothes of the occupiers of the lands of lebanon and the gaza strip

1073020 i remember at one point coming across his collection of materials on anti semitism there were certainly materials from germany but the focus of the collection and his own concerns was elsewhere anti semitism was a problem associated with france germany in general was presented as the success story this helps explain the strong self assurance that german jews of this golden era felt they considered themselves germans and indeed one of their faults was certainly a measure of hostility directed against their co religionists there were few slurs hurled more heavily by the german jews who had arrived as those against the ostjuden

1073034 patients seek out breast reduction surgery for many reasons not the least of which is to ease pain and discomfort associated with having larger breasts
1073035 however there is also an emotional discomfort as well including low self esteem social and sexual embarrassment and frustration with difficulties in performing daily routines it was our goal to determine quantitatively whether these emotional issues improved as well as the physical
1073036 this study further demonstrates that the connection between the aesthetic results of plastic surgery and the emotional social and physical quality of life of our patients cannot be underestimated
1073037 these findings will go a long way towards helping us to evaluate and better understand the implications of the impact of plastic surgery on patients lives and serve as an example of our commitment to evidence based medicine and outcome studies in aesthetic surgery

1073066 speaking from the museum point of view its very easy to look at the world in a vacuum but there are always market forces in how things are produced the fact that recasting is an easy process is probably driving this trend
1073067 the idea of taking a quotidian object and rendering it in a new material or taking a quotidian material and making something different out of it thats the post modern experiment going back to frank gehrys cardboard chairs
1073068 when designers were recasting ancient greece it was because of an ideology the ideology of the classical world or in the 70s and 80s it was this backlash against corporate modernism but casting and gilding as ways of creating an object are very easy manufacturers love it because its low cost speaking from the museum point of view its very easy to look at the world in a vacuum but there are always market forces in how things are produced the fact that recasting is an easy process is probably driving this trend
1073069 these items are not just souvenirs and there are no famous names behind them or manuals required to operate them

1073078 im fed up with the whole idea and now its time to laugh about it here you go society chew on that
1073079 lord today i surrender my negative thinking to you and ask that you give me the strength to get back on track i surrender my eating and exercise habits to you knowing that you will provide the strength and discipline i need to make it through today and the rest of the week thank you for reminding me that i can do all things through christ who strengthens me amen
1073080 sprained knee and its day to day and we anticipate he should be sooner than later
1073081 i never thought what it was until the doctors really looked at it you didnt know hes going to be fine hes walking around a little bit and he should be back here pretty soon i dont think hell participate in the chicago game but well look at it next week
1073082 he got kicked in the shin its like when you are playing soccer and you dont have those shin guards
1073083 yeah i mean now hes going to have to play in the pre season to get his carries and his runs and the timing with the offensive line hes anticipating having a good year
1073084 well sit down and talk how many carries he needs to get ready the whole thing with running backs is picking up the blitz pickups and running the ball getting hit and getting tackled there is a number in his mind where hell feel comfortable i learned that from curtis martin when i was in new york there was a number of carries he needed in the pre season and you have to make sure you get those carries to feel good about yourself
1073085 but youre talking about two players who are two first round draft choices theyre a little bit different theyre pretty special as far as picking things up and understanding the game of football thats the saving grace for those two guys everything ive seen from those guys so far is everything we anticipated when we drafted them
1073086 well start talking about that actually tonight well make a decision on whos going to play how long theyre going to play and how many plays i think im going to go by plays more than quarter s
1073087 no i think well just have to do some things to make sure we protect him i think what youre realizing as you watch practice and some of you have just arrived i wont mention the names but when you run boots and nakeds that always protects your quarterback some that always has the defensive end in a predicament where if he continues up the field and this guy runs around the corner weve got a problem with that in your offense that gives you the ability to protect the quarterback some just by doing that thats something weve added to our offense and so far has looked pretty good now weve got to go do it in a game
1073088 the kid told me that hed never been hurt thats what he told me so i told him were getting it out of the way you got it in the spring sprained ankle a little bit and now were getting it in training camp that means during the season you dont get hurt
1073089 theres nothing you can do its just football you hate for it to happen to any player when it happens to a first round pick everyone gets concerned but you dont need to be concerned hes going to get well and hes going to come back hes going to be a good player both those kids ive said it and ill say it again the kids we drafted are going to give us a great opportunity to build this organization and this franchise in a direction that we want to go all these guys are going to have an opportunity to play and theyre going to be good players
1073090 no because there is always somebody who has it worse than i do ive lived a great life and ive been very fortunate to be in this league all these years and you accept what happens to you you always find something good about it you find another guy who wouldnt have gotten all those reps that ends up being a good football player the good thing about it is theyre not done for the season theyre going to come back and theyre going to help us win
1073091 no he cant run fast hes more quick than fast hes athletic when we looked at quarterbacks our whole mindset was weve got to get a guy who has the ability to get outside of the pocket and make plays on the run when the train is not on time youve got to have a quarterback who can delay that can go make a play both our guys can brodie can get outside the numbers and throw the ball anywhere on the field wide or short theyre not running quarterbacks but theyve got some ability to move and throw on the run

1073142 backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
1073143 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
1073144 this is the same thing that was done four years ago or eight years ago
1073145 you guys are all familiar with this we have seen this movie before
1073146 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1073147 how dare you try to disrupt our political system with your disfunctional family
1073148 you may not have to wait until 2012 obama is imploding so fast that by convention time dems will be running to hillary screaming save us save us i have already written senator nelson i live in florida a hillary supporter to make sure her name is put in nomination above all this is where our efforts now ought to be getting commitments from the dnc and super delegates that her name be placed in nomination if that i happens i believe she will win i spent many years in ny politics and i know many of the players at this point they are looking for a way out we have to keep the heat on to give them room to maneuver
1073149 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this
1073150 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
1073151 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1073152 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
1073153 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
1073154 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1073155 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
1073156 i knew that i needed to act as both the grenade thrower and the bomb deflector if we were going to get from here to there
1073157 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1073158 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
1073159 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
1073160 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1073161 we must revitalize our military to foster peace obama claimed echoing orwell by adding 65 000 soldiers to the army and 27 000 to the marines
1073162 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
1073163 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
1073164 has told top u s officials that israel wont rule out a military strike against iran
1073165 the african american reputation as the most consistently progressive ethnic group in the united states will stand or fall according to how blacks comport themselves politically under a barack obama administration
1073166 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
1073167 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
1073168 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
1073169 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
1073170 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
1073171 scarborough is the media turning against him is the media going to start seizing on things like this to prove that theyre not in the tank for barack obama
1073172 halperin theres been a little bit of the paradigm shift i think that mccain web video might have had the same effect as the saturday night live parody that on the clinton obama race
1073173 mr obamas advisers say that a central message of his campaign that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in washington would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated democratic politics since bill clinton won the presidency in 1992
1073174 i think its time for a revival of dope jokes
1073175 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
1073176 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
1073177 hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
1073178 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush
1073179 it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1073180 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
1073181 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
1073182 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
1073183 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
1073184 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
1073185 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
1073186 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye
1073187 i criticize moveon for what they are not doing and that is empowering a bottom up democratic progressive movement for fundamental social and political change
1073188 it is unclear whether speaker nancy pelosi would allow a final vote
1073189 in that little jail cell thats in the basement of the house
1073190 we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible
1073191 resulted in very serious damage in the department of justice
1073192 did not think there was a sufficient basis for criminal prosecutions for false statements for anyone
1073193 potential bar issues for the attorneys who have committed misconduct
1073194 so i dont believe they have gotten away with it
1073195 in 2001 michael l connell of govtech solutions l l c a notoriously partisan gop operative and bush family confidant was selected to re organize the capitol hill it network under the guise of selecting a female owned it company connells wife heather is listed as the owner former congressman and convicted felon bob ney reportedly arranged for connell to be the man behind the firewall for the u s house of representatives connells role and activities need to be investigated by putting connell under oath and examining how arguably one of the countrys most zealously partisan it specialists managed to land the contract and be allowed access to this electronic communication system

1073197 congress conspired to grant millions of acres to the railroad barons
1073198 used their political and economic power to take possession of digital channels they have done absolutely nothing to earn
1073199 what this business needs in general are more young people who need to be great journalists but who also need to know all the technology to be more nimble and resourceful
1073200 the idea is to give our readers as complete a picture as possible of the coverage around the web on the stories our editors think are important

1073212 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1073213 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1073214 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1073215 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1073216 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1073242 economic models that have correctly predicted the winner of almost all post war u s presidential elections say recession fears will secure a victory for barack obama in november
1073243 everything that the obama people were doing they accused the hillary clinton people of doing it
1073244 hillary clinton asks not to be nominated at democratic national convention
1073245 she talked about her name being put into nomination and she said that she wanted her voters to be heard and for her delegates to have the experience of what a real convention is she said that by doing this and by having a roll call that it would help unify the party

1073352 everything that the obama people were doing they accused the hillary clinton people of doing it
1073353 hillary clinton asks not to be nominated at democratic national convention
1073354 she talked about her name being put into nomination and she said that she wanted her voters to be heard and for her delegates to have the experience of what a real convention is she said that by doing this and by having a roll call that it would help unify the party
1073355 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out on
1073356 i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong
1073357 appear to have been railroaded into a very difficult situation
1073358 if he can change on fisa nafta kyl lieberman iran the surge sort of guns abortion campaign financing corporate taxes the payroll tax cap his devotion to reverend wright and trinity united church unconditional meetings with ahmadinejad and an undivided jerusalem why not offshore drilling i figure itll take a couple of weeks or until gas hits 5 a gallon which ever comes first
1073359 can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks
1073360 backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
1073361 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
1073362 this is the same thing that was done four years ago or eight years ago
1073363 you guys are all familiar with this we have seen this movie before
1073364 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1073365 how dare you try to disrupt our political system with your disfunctional family
1073366 you may not have to wait until 2012 obama is imploding so fast that by convention time dems will be running to hillary screaming save us save us i have already written senator nelson i live in florida a hillary supporter to make sure her name is put in nomination above all this is where our efforts now ought to be getting commitments from the dnc and super delegates that her name be placed in nomination if that i happens i believe she will win i spent many years in ny politics and i know many of the players at this point they are looking for a way out we have to keep the heat on to give them room to maneuver
1073367 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this
1073368 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
1073369 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1073370 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
1073371 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
1073372 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1073373 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
1073374 i knew that i needed to act as both the grenade thrower and the bomb deflector if we were going to get from here to there
1073375 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1073376 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
1073377 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
1073378 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1073379 we must revitalize our military to foster peace obama claimed echoing orwell by adding 65 000 soldiers to the army and 27 000 to the marines
1073380 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
1073381 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
1073382 has told top u s officials that israel wont rule out a military strike against iran
1073383 the african american reputation as the most consistently progressive ethnic group in the united states will stand or fall according to how blacks comport themselves politically under a barack obama administration
1073384 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
1073385 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
1073386 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
1073387 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
1073388 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
1073389 scarborough is the media turning against him is the media going to start seizing on things like this to prove that theyre not in the tank for barack obama
1073390 halperin theres been a little bit of the paradigm shift i think that mccain web video might have had the same effect as the saturday night live parody that on the clinton obama race
1073391 mr obamas advisers say that a central message of his campaign that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in washington would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated democratic politics since bill clinton won the presidency in 1992
1073392 i think its time for a revival of dope jokes
1073393 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
1073394 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
1073395 hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
1073396 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush
1073397 it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1073398 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
1073399 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
1073400 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
1073401 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
1073402 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
1073403 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
1073404 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye
1073405 i criticize moveon for what they are not doing and that is empowering a bottom up democratic progressive movement for fundamental social and political change
1073406 it is unclear whether speaker nancy pelosi would allow a final vote
1073407 in that little jail cell thats in the basement of the house
1073408 we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible
1073409 resulted in very serious damage in the department of justice
1073410 did not think there was a sufficient basis for criminal prosecutions for false statements for anyone
1073411 potential bar issues for the attorneys who have committed misconduct
1073412 so i dont believe they have gotten away with it
1073413 in 2001 michael l connell of govtech solutions l l c a notoriously partisan gop operative and bush family confidant was selected to re organize the capitol hill it network under the guise of selecting a female owned it company connells wife heather is listed as the owner former congressman and convicted felon bob ney reportedly arranged for connell to be the man behind the firewall for the u s house of representatives connells role and activities need to be investigated by putting connell under oath and examining how arguably one of the countrys most zealously partisan it specialists managed to land the contract and be allowed access to this electronic communication system
1073414 abandon ed the troop visit because the cameras werent allowed
1073415 congress conspired to grant millions of acres to the railroad barons
1073416 used their political and economic power to take possession of digital channels they have done absolutely nothing to earn
1073417 what this business needs in general are more young people who need to be great journalists but who also need to know all the technology to be more nimble and resourceful
1073418 the idea is to give our readers as complete a picture as possible of the coverage around the web on the stories our editors think are important
1073419 readers uninterested in that aggregation of content will still be able to use our regular home page
1073420 time inc has complete editorial control over all of its 120 magazines and 40 websites
1073421 as such it was one of those small events that may well mark a watershed toward a truly cross platform world with professionally produced content playing wherever the audience wants to see it and breaking down the wall of tv network vs
1073422 civilian casualties increased by 62 percent in 2008 compared to figures from the first six months of 2007
1073423 obtained dozens of small business contracts worth more than 110 million even though
1073424 may have improperly classified blackwater guards in iraq and afghanistan as independent contractors rather than employees
1073425 not within 10 miles of a highway overpass to sleep under
1073426 i dont believe that the doha round is yet a failure
1073427 i think there were difficulties and in that difficulty it was better to stop to reflect how to continue
1073428 i was very clear with bush that it is not possible that two countries as important as the united states and india which are negotiating a nuclear agreement cant find the conditions to make a deal on the issue of food because there is very little remaining differences between them
1073429 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
1073430 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1073431 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1073432 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1073433 the oil markets main focus right now is on any weakness that signals a slowdown in the economy and this personal spending report is further evidence of that
1073434 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1073435 the hsbc group has a global strategy of joining up the company
1073436 hsbc bank canada and hsbc financial corporation limited are both successful companies and will continue to operate as separate businesses while sharing best practices as we build the hsbc brand in canada
1073437 the company initiated a voluntary retrenchment redundancy package because mining in our depleted mines was becoming difficult
1073438 our aim is to trim operating cost and increase productivity
1073439 we have ceased operations in two of our depleted mines driefontein and kloof that dismisses claims by the union that we were transferring workers to kloof
1073440 workers chose to go home rather than risk their lives
1073441 given the forecast for tropical storm edouard shell will begin limited evacuations of approximately 40 personnel from some of its gulf of mexico west operations area today monday
1073442 no further evacuations are planned at this time and based on current information and forecast we do not expect any impact on shell operated production in the gulf of mexico
1073443 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
1073444 open web foundation is not a standards body but it wants to do the same things they do only hipper
1073445 google evangelist dion almaer as rationalizing the need for yet another
1073446 justification for why existing web standards organizations do not meet their needs
1073447 one off organizations like the open id foundation and the whatwg that are dedicated to a specific technology
1073448 the united states has significantly underreported the number of new h i v infections occurring nationally each year
1073449 the annual infection rate is 40 percent higher than previously estimated
1073450 this person has to step up and stand here with mr wilkes
1073451 communicates the primarily nonreligious message of military service death and sacrifice as such despite its location on public land the memorial is constitutional
1073452 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1073453 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1073454 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1073455 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1073456 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1073459 at one point the lights went off in the house and the microphones were turned off in the chamber meaning republicans were talking in the dark
1073460 this band of brothers here is staying late to make a point to the american people we want to work
1073461 republicans felt they got a lot of good press out of fridays revolt so they will be back at it again

1073469 rick smolan has found another way to support his gorgeous and thus expensive collaborative photography books sponsorship
1073470 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned
1073471 many of the kinds of stories covered by individual newspapers today simply wont see the light of day in the future
1073472 for 13 years ive been a cheerleader and ambassador for the station despite our struggling in the ratings because i believed in the product
1073473 ive been coming around to the opinion that bloggers are just journalists
1073474 im willing to make the same prediction about blogging that i made 10 years ago about internet companies in 10 years there wont be an distinction
1073475 being a blogger does not make you a journalist any more than being a journalist makes you a blogger
1073476 far exceeds what outsiders have reported as the estimated download total from the bands official website regardless of whether those downloaders paid or not
1073477 machiavelli and sun tzu working in tandem couldnt have put together a week for john mccain that would have rivaled the favorable coverage that obamas getting from his foreign tour

1073479 during july the number of americans who consider themselves to be democrats fell two percentage points to 39
1073480 while barack obama has been newsstand gold for some publications people magazine isnt one of them as its obama and family cover turned out to sell at slightly below its usual newsstand average
1073481 people normally sells 1 45 million copies a week on newsstands the latest estimates put the sales figure for last weeks obama cover at 1 4 million it is believed to be one of the first covers featuring obama that has not sold above normal when time had obama on the cover in 2006 it was the second best selling cover of the year

1073564 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1073565 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1073568 at one point the lights went off in the house and the microphones were turned off in the chamber meaning republicans were talking in the dark
1073569 this band of brothers here is staying late to make a point to the american people we want to work
1073570 republicans felt they got a lot of good press out of fridays revolt so they will be back at it again

1073573 mona shaw was the first called before polk county fifth judicial district associate judge william price

1073575 perhaps the most idiotic form of communication of our time

1073577 illegal distribution and commercial use of audio and video files owned by mediaset the milan based company said in an e mailed statement today the lawsuit was filed in a rome court
1073578 rick smolan has found another way to support his gorgeous and thus expensive collaborative photography books sponsorship
1073579 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned
1073580 many of the kinds of stories covered by individual newspapers today simply wont see the light of day in the future
1073581 for 13 years ive been a cheerleader and ambassador for the station despite our struggling in the ratings because i believed in the product
1073582 ive been coming around to the opinion that bloggers are just journalists
1073583 im willing to make the same prediction about blogging that i made 10 years ago about internet companies in 10 years there wont be an distinction
1073584 being a blogger does not make you a journalist any more than being a journalist makes you a blogger
1073585 far exceeds what outsiders have reported as the estimated download total from the bands official website regardless of whether those downloaders paid or not
1073586 machiavelli and sun tzu working in tandem couldnt have put together a week for john mccain that would have rivaled the favorable coverage that obamas getting from his foreign tour
1073587 with a 3 gain in a a as a percentage of the electorate obama still does not win in missouri even if we give mccain 0 a a votes
1073588 during july the number of americans who consider themselves to be democrats fell two percentage points to 39
1073589 while barack obama has been newsstand gold for some publications people magazine isnt one of them as its obama and family cover turned out to sell at slightly below its usual newsstand average
1073590 people normally sells 1 45 million copies a week on newsstands the latest estimates put the sales figure for last weeks obama cover at 1 4 million it is believed to be one of the first covers featuring obama that has not sold above normal when time had obama on the cover in 2006 it was the second best selling cover of the year
1073591 economic models that have correctly predicted the winner of almost all post war u s presidential elections say recession fears will secure a victory for barack obama in november
1073592 everything that the obama people were doing they accused the hillary clinton people of doing it
1073593 hillary clinton asks not to be nominated at democratic national convention
1073594 she talked about her name being put into nomination and she said that she wanted her voters to be heard and for her delegates to have the experience of what a real convention is she said that by doing this and by having a roll call that it would help unify the party
1073595 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out on
1073596 i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong
1073597 appear to have been railroaded into a very difficult situation
1073598 if he can change on fisa nafta kyl lieberman iran the surge sort of guns abortion campaign financing corporate taxes the payroll tax cap his devotion to reverend wright and trinity united church unconditional meetings with ahmadinejad and an undivided jerusalem why not offshore drilling i figure itll take a couple of weeks or until gas hits 5 a gallon which ever comes first
1073599 can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks
1073600 backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
1073601 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
1073602 this is the same thing that was done four years ago or eight years ago
1073603 you guys are all familiar with this we have seen this movie before
1073604 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1073605 how dare you try to disrupt our political system with your disfunctional family
1073606 you may not have to wait until 2012 obama is imploding so fast that by convention time dems will be running to hillary screaming save us save us i have already written senator nelson i live in florida a hillary supporter to make sure her name is put in nomination above all this is where our efforts now ought to be getting commitments from the dnc and super delegates that her name be placed in nomination if that i happens i believe she will win i spent many years in ny politics and i know many of the players at this point they are looking for a way out we have to keep the heat on to give them room to maneuver
1073607 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this
1073608 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
1073609 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1073610 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
1073611 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
1073612 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1073613 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
1073614 i knew that i needed to act as both the grenade thrower and the bomb deflector if we were going to get from here to there
1073615 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1073616 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
1073617 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
1073618 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1073619 we must revitalize our military to foster peace obama claimed echoing orwell by adding 65 000 soldiers to the army and 27 000 to the marines
1073620 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
1073621 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
1073622 has told top u s officials that israel wont rule out a military strike against iran
1073623 the african american reputation as the most consistently progressive ethnic group in the united states will stand or fall according to how blacks comport themselves politically under a barack obama administration
1073624 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
1073625 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
1073626 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
1073627 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
1073628 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
1073629 scarborough is the media turning against him is the media going to start seizing on things like this to prove that theyre not in the tank for barack obama
1073630 halperin theres been a little bit of the paradigm shift i think that mccain web video might have had the same effect as the saturday night live parody that on the clinton obama race
1073631 mr obamas advisers say that a central message of his campaign that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in washington would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated democratic politics since bill clinton won the presidency in 1992
1073632 i think its time for a revival of dope jokes
1073633 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
1073634 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
1073635 hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
1073636 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush
1073637 it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1073638 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
1073639 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
1073640 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
1073641 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
1073642 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
1073643 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
1073644 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye
1073645 i criticize moveon for what they are not doing and that is empowering a bottom up democratic progressive movement for fundamental social and political change
1073646 it is unclear whether speaker nancy pelosi would allow a final vote
1073647 in that little jail cell thats in the basement of the house
1073648 we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible
1073649 resulted in very serious damage in the department of justice
1073650 did not think there was a sufficient basis for criminal prosecutions for false statements for anyone
1073651 potential bar issues for the attorneys who have committed misconduct
1073652 so i dont believe they have gotten away with it

1073670 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707

1073779 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1073780 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1073781 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1073782 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama

1073797 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned
1073798 many of the kinds of stories covered by individual newspapers today simply wont see the light of day in the future
1073799 for 13 years ive been a cheerleader and ambassador for the station despite our struggling in the ratings because i believed in the product
1073800 ive been coming around to the opinion that bloggers are just journalists
1073801 im willing to make the same prediction about blogging that i made 10 years ago about internet companies in 10 years there wont be an distinction
1073802 being a blogger does not make you a journalist any more than being a journalist makes you a blogger
1073803 far exceeds what outsiders have reported as the estimated download total from the bands official website regardless of whether those downloaders paid or not
1073804 machiavelli and sun tzu working in tandem couldnt have put together a week for john mccain that would have rivaled the favorable coverage that obamas getting from his foreign tour
1073805 with a 3 gain in a a as a percentage of the electorate obama still does not win in missouri even if we give mccain 0 a a votes
1073806 during july the number of americans who consider themselves to be democrats fell two percentage points to 39
1073807 while barack obama has been newsstand gold for some publications people magazine isnt one of them as its obama and family cover turned out to sell at slightly below its usual newsstand average
1073808 people normally sells 1 45 million copies a week on newsstands the latest estimates put the sales figure for last weeks obama cover at 1 4 million it is believed to be one of the first covers featuring obama that has not sold above normal when time had obama on the cover in 2006 it was the second best selling cover of the year
1073809 economic models that have correctly predicted the winner of almost all post war u s presidential elections say recession fears will secure a victory for barack obama in november
1073810 everything that the obama people were doing they accused the hillary clinton people of doing it
1073811 hillary clinton asks not to be nominated at democratic national convention
1073812 she talked about her name being put into nomination and she said that she wanted her voters to be heard and for her delegates to have the experience of what a real convention is she said that by doing this and by having a roll call that it would help unify the party
1073813 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out on
1073814 i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong
1073815 appear to have been railroaded into a very difficult situation
1073816 if he can change on fisa nafta kyl lieberman iran the surge sort of guns abortion campaign financing corporate taxes the payroll tax cap his devotion to reverend wright and trinity united church unconditional meetings with ahmadinejad and an undivided jerusalem why not offshore drilling i figure itll take a couple of weeks or until gas hits 5 a gallon which ever comes first
1073817 can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks
1073818 backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
1073819 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
1073820 this is the same thing that was done four years ago or eight years ago
1073821 you guys are all familiar with this we have seen this movie before
1073822 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1073823 how dare you try to disrupt our political system with your disfunctional family
1073824 you may not have to wait until 2012 obama is imploding so fast that by convention time dems will be running to hillary screaming save us save us i have already written senator nelson i live in florida a hillary supporter to make sure her name is put in nomination above all this is where our efforts now ought to be getting commitments from the dnc and super delegates that her name be placed in nomination if that i happens i believe she will win i spent many years in ny politics and i know many of the players at this point they are looking for a way out we have to keep the heat on to give them room to maneuver
1073825 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this
1073826 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
1073827 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1073828 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
1073829 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
1073830 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1073831 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
1073832 i knew that i needed to act as both the grenade thrower and the bomb deflector if we were going to get from here to there
1073833 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1073834 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
1073835 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
1073836 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1073837 we must revitalize our military to foster peace obama claimed echoing orwell by adding 65 000 soldiers to the army and 27 000 to the marines
1073838 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
1073839 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
1073840 has told top u s officials that israel wont rule out a military strike against iran
1073841 the african american reputation as the most consistently progressive ethnic group in the united states will stand or fall according to how blacks comport themselves politically under a barack obama administration
1073842 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
1073843 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
1073844 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
1073845 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
1073846 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
1073847 scarborough is the media turning against him is the media going to start seizing on things like this to prove that theyre not in the tank for barack obama
1073848 halperin theres been a little bit of the paradigm shift i think that mccain web video might have had the same effect as the saturday night live parody that on the clinton obama race
1073849 mr obamas advisers say that a central message of his campaign that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in washington would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated democratic politics since bill clinton won the presidency in 1992
1073850 i think its time for a revival of dope jokes
1073851 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
1073852 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
1073853 hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
1073854 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush
1073855 it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1073856 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
1073857 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
1073858 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
1073859 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
1073860 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
1073861 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
1073862 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye
1073863 i criticize moveon for what they are not doing and that is empowering a bottom up democratic progressive movement for fundamental social and political change
1073864 it is unclear whether speaker nancy pelosi would allow a final vote
1073865 in that little jail cell thats in the basement of the house
1073866 we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible
1073867 resulted in very serious damage in the department of justice
1073868 did not think there was a sufficient basis for criminal prosecutions for false statements for anyone
1073869 potential bar issues for the attorneys who have committed misconduct
1073870 so i dont believe they have gotten away with it
1073871 in 2001 michael l connell of govtech solutions l l c a notoriously partisan gop operative and bush family confidant was selected to re organize the capitol hill it network under the guise of selecting a female owned it company connells wife heather is listed as the owner former congressman and convicted felon bob ney reportedly arranged for connell to be the man behind the firewall for the u s house of representatives connells role and activities need to be investigated by putting connell under oath and examining how arguably one of the countrys most zealously partisan it specialists managed to land the contract and be allowed access to this electronic communication system
1073872 abandon ed the troop visit because the cameras werent allowed
1073873 congress conspired to grant millions of acres to the railroad barons
1073874 used their political and economic power to take possession of digital channels they have done absolutely nothing to earn
1073875 what this business needs in general are more young people who need to be great journalists but who also need to know all the technology to be more nimble and resourceful
1073876 the idea is to give our readers as complete a picture as possible of the coverage around the web on the stories our editors think are important
1073877 readers uninterested in that aggregation of content will still be able to use our regular home page
1073878 time inc has complete editorial control over all of its 120 magazines and 40 websites

1073883 not within 10 miles of a highway overpass to sleep under
1073884 the scale of the banks financial prejudice can be explained by the fraudulent manoeuvres of a trader who abused the trust of his hierarchy by taking advantage of its deficiencies and of the faults in the internal control system
1073885 a shift in the current monetary stance is likely to be a story for 2009 rather than 2008
1073886 in line with the consensus in expecting policy rates to be left on hold
1073887 this is the first phase of investment in lithium ion batteries sony is undertaking as part of efforts to reinforce core areas of its component and semiconductor business over the next three years
1073888 while we must reflect the global stock market as it is we must also recognize the rapid rise of companies in countries such as india
1073889 we have already seen great indian companies acquiring famous brands such as jaguar and land rover but these developments are just the beginning of a long term trend that will fundamentally change the international corporate landscape
1073890 we will see huge capital flows both from and to india in coming years and that is an opportunity for us as a financial information company as well as for international investors who want to take advantage of this profound trend
1073891 is for a significant slowdown but no recession or prolonged period of sluggish activity
1073892 a deceleration in the course of 2008 and a re acceleration toward trend during 2009

1073977 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
1073978 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances

1073980 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush

1073982 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
1073983 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
1073984 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
1073985 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
1073986 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
1073987 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
1073988 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye

1074014 perhaps one of the greatest frustrations of living with chronic illness is the inability to predict how youre going to be feeling on any given day an exhausting week at the office coupled with intense ministry left me physically and emotionally drained unable to make church this morning on days like this rather than miss out on worship and the preaching of the word i worship online at new hope streams their services online and offers video on demand i love the creativity of this church and think that you will too

1074040 this kind of thing scandals happens all the time somehow it becomes the price celebrities pay for their fame now i agree with johnny is that his name keep it low if your trust in maou guy is as strong as what youre saying then theres no problem and who cares if companies are dropping him because of these rumors theyll regret it sooner or later with his fans backing him up i think he can get through this whole ordeal
1074041 china is moving quickly to develop social work services and they are developing practice and policy innovations from which we are learning
1074042 international collaboration forces us to look at old problems in new ways and allows us to see new possible solutions that were not evident previously
1074043 im not aware of any state thats done it and the u s certainly hasnt done anything like this
1074044 school faculty are excited about the opportunity to work more closely with the educational institutions in china though cultivating a deeper relationship and trust will take time
1074045 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1074046 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1074047 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1074048 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
1074049 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life

1074055 it s not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area
1074056 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1074057 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so they re reluctant to prices
1074058 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1074059 the oil market s main focus right now is on any weakness that signals a slowdown in the economy and this personal spending report is further evidence of that

1074073 process is an embedded reaction to prior stupidity we are often glad of this of course it explains a lot of whats good about the world our knives come equipped with handles
1074074 and our programs include dialog boxes that say are you sure you want to casually delete the last 3 hours of work all because of lessons learned from prior stupidity but but not all stupidity is amenable to deflection by process and even when it is the overhead created by process is often not worth the savings in deflected stupidity stupidity is frequently a one off and a process designed to deflect it within an organization actually ends up embedding it as a negative shape like the outline of wile e coyote just after he is catapaulted through a wall making everyone fill out the form designed to keep you from doing the stupid thing that one guy did three years ago actually emphasizes the sense memoryof that stupid thing within the group caution the beverage you are about to enjoy is extremely hot

1074076 its easy now to pretend that the surge and its success was inevitable
1074077 to you basil the renaissance was just something that happened to
1074078 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
1074079 mccains facts are literally true but his insinuation that the visit was canceled because of the press ban or the desire for gym time is false in fact obama visited wounded troops earlier without cameras or press both in the u s and iraq and his gym workouts are a daily routine
1074080 senator obama had hoped to and had every intention of visiting our troops to express his appreciation and gratitude for their service to our country
1074081 we learned from the pentagon wednesday night that the visit would be viewed instead as a campaign event senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event and decided instead not to go
1074082 nobody denied senator obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at landstuhl obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity
1074083 restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics
1074084 the senators staff was informed of the limits on what the military can do with respect to a political campaign and how we could support a senators visit to landstuhl and quite frankly i expected them to have the visit
1074085 the senator decided out of respect for these servicemen and women that it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a u s military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign
1074086 it seems that one of obamas campaign advisors and one of his spokesmen said that obama decided not to go because he didnt want it to appear as a campaign event
1074087 another option to taxing the politicians is to lower their pay
1074088 very few economists believe that you can cut taxes and you will get the same amount of revenues when you cut taxes you gain some revenue back we dont know exactly what this is but its not small but its also not 70 percent or anything like that
1074089 snake oil salesman who is trying to sell a miracle cure
1074090 it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
1074091 we learned from the pentagon last night that the visit would be viewed instead as a campaign event
1074092 senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go
1074093 the key to defeating the initiative is to keep it off the ballot in the first place

1074100 greg mankiw stated that an economist who says that tax cuts pay for themselves is a
1074101 the result is that once again lawmakers and the governor are facing off over what to cut revenues are 472 million short of the forecasts made in january and next years budget is already 400 million in deficit
1074102 if they lower taxes the revenue to the state will increase it happens everytime its tried
1074103 and since jenny our democrat senator has taken over mi has lost 490 000 jobs

1074105 another option to taxing the politicians is to lower their pay

1074107 snake oil salesman who is trying to sell a miracle cure
1074108 there is something wrong with a system that charges people tuition that dont have children in college
1074109 they raised taxes causing people to tighten their budgets yet the state increased their spending this is wrong
1074110 im about one fingernail away from suggesting we need a revolution to replace all politicians
1074111 right youd have a reason to complain about them being from the
1074112 being a right wing think tank basically makes them a propaganda mill people should be suspicious of the policy proposals of any think tank that is committed to a particular ideology the mackinac center is not objective in their analysis of basically any subject but they are often cited as if their proposals are based on objectivity
1074113 the united states is in a recession but the downturn is expected to be mild because consumer spending is not expected to fall precipitously
1074114 again if you dont like the think tank then refute their facts
1074115 a nonpartisan research and educational institute devoted to improving the quality of life for all michigan citizens by promoting sound solutions to state and local policy questions the mackinac center assists policy makers scholars business people the media and the public by providing objective analysis of michigan issues the goal of all center reports commentaries and educational programs is to equip michigan citizens and other decision makers to better evaluate policy options
1074116 i believe they are open and honest about what they want
1074117 if the state cuts the funding by 20 its possible that the tuition will increase the first year however when they no longer are getting students because their costs are too high theyll cut their fat to be competitive with like schools from other states
1074118 im for cutting it all by 20 if you truly want to share the pain cut spending by 20 across the board
1074119 since you chose to call me a moron i guess its okay for me to return the favor especially in light of what you said about people not paying for education if they arent or their family that they may be responsible for is not attending then to turn around and say that tax dollars support public colleges and universities
1074120 you believe our legislators are intelligent i wonder if youd say the same thing when the republicans hold the house senate and governorship
1074121 i suspect you wouldnt say that if that were the case which i also believe you alluded to earlier in this when you tried to lay the fault at the feet of the republicans in the 90s youd also think they were intelligent
1074122 you also say that you think they lack political will or are more committed to party ideology or political party so now you have just contradicted yourself
1074123 there is place for both open source and proprietary in any sme environment its really about the right tools for the job
1074124 for example in a desktop environment in which users just need a simple web interface basic word processing and a spreadsheet an open source package such as ubuntu running openoffice would be perfect these users dont need the bells and whistles of a microsoft office
1074125 absolutely the way to go open source allows for rapid change customisation and greater flexibility
1074126 sme versions of heavyweight proprietary solutions generally offer fewer features than their big brother counterparts which is why they are more affordable for the sme but what if the particular whistle that has been left out is one the sme needs and what if there are still features in the lite version that the sme can easily do without
1074127 with an open source option smes can have a solution that not only fits their precise needs it will be easy to scale as the business grows

1074161 i felt like i was getting back at those guys who were keeping me from my friends and family
1074162 i know for sure when i played the game it helped me take my mind of the illness
1074163 we need to be a lot more imaginative about how we influence peoples behaviour to have positive impacts on their health
1074164 you dont just learn about the one you have it gives you a broader understanding of cancer
1074165 i got quite educated about the different forms of cancer what and where they attacked in the body
1074166 its definitely a good idea for patients to experience it
1074167 this may be a more effective way for them to understand and embrace cancer treatment
1074168 visualizing the battle helped give them a sense of power and control over cancer
1074169 that helps them to be the victor instead of the victim of cancer
1074170 this is the strongest evidence to date that video games are not just entertainment but powerful tools that can impact behaviour and be important for health
1074171 weve got the drugs but theyre not going to work if the kids arent going to take them
1074172 what we do in the game is make it clear to people that this behaviour taking the follow up chemo monitoring side effects is important at a biological level it shows you the battle still going on in your body and what you need to do for a dramatic triumph over cancer
1074173 the idea was to come up with something that would have an impact
1074174 we know from other studies that if kids deviate from their prescribed therapies there could be a significant impact on their survival
1074175 the timing of all the drug delivery is so precise now you have to do it on the exact time day hour to make sure the combination therapy is going to do all the things it is supposed to do
1074176 what i find is the kids that play this game go through this whole process a lot easier
1074177 they understand they are not the only ones going through this

1074184 these are encouraging results as they signal good stuff for those children fortunate enough to be living with both of their parents but this study also left me thinking about how all of the children in single parent households are fairing
1074185 i have a personal interest in this because believe me when i was growing up ward cleaver wasnt pulling into our driveway every night nope in the 50s my brother and i were a bit of an anomaly a couple of kids being raised by a single working mother and a single working grandmother right there smack dab in the middle of southern california suburbia
1074186 but what do i know from my own experience im happy to report that children from single parent households can and do grow up to be healthy happy adults truly some of the best fathers i know were raised by single parents like my big brother

1074470 mccain wants this contest to be about whos more like britney spears well im the young guy in the race so theres that but just like britney spears mccain has no plan to bring american troops out of iraq and just like britney spears mccain has no understanding of economics and just like britney spears john mccain is a strong supporter of george bush so if its a question whos more like britney spears thats a debate im happy to have
1074471 our troops are dying in iraq and afghanistan and john mccain is obsessing over a young heiress
1074472 were here to talk about the economy and john mccain wants to talk about britney spears
1074473 were ready to sit down with prime minister al maliki to talk about a timetable for bringing our troops home with honor but john mccain prefers to talk about paris hilton
1074474 and when we get together to talk about providing healthcare to americas working families what do you think john mccains going to want to talk about hell probably want to talk about brad pitt and angelina jolie
1074475 were talking about the things that matter to real people and john mccain wants to talk about the things that matter to people magazine
1074476 its funny that my opponent would try to paint me as a celebrity after all it wasnt me who guest hosted snl as my opponent did it wasnt me who announced his candidacy on letterman as my opponent did
1074477 since senator mccain brings up the issue of preparedness for office lets talk about who was wrong about iraq and who has been wrong about the economy lets talk about who wants to change washington and who is desparately clinging to president bushs apron strings senator obamas ready to lead with a program of meaningful change senator mccain has been wrong on the decisions he has made and has been flip flopping on everything else
1074478 honestly i think we should just trust our president in the decisions he makes and be faithfull to what happens

1074486 the dric downriver border crossing is the absolutely best alternative because it will significantly ease traffic congestion between detroit and windsor thus enhancing the ability of companies on both sides of the river to get their products to market in a timely and efficient manner
1074487 the windsor detroit gateway is more than a river crossing it is not only vitally important to the economies of windsor and southeast michigan it is a critical supply chain stretching from montreal to the port of los angeles windsor supports the preferred location announced recently by the bi national study to locate the next crossing in the brighton beach industrial area of the city

1074523 i believe anyone who says we can achieve energy independence without that without more nuclear power without more offshore drilling without more clean coal that individual either doesnt have the experience to understand the problem we are faced with or isnt being straightforward with the american people

1074526 if his conviction stands the enron prosecutions were a success if it doesnt prosecutors will have a hard time convincing the public that they took the right approach
1074527 but its clear that the law is evolving in this area

1074552 the global poverty act of 2007 s 2433 is coming up for a senate vote according the office of senator kay bailey hutchison once harry reid and the democrat leadership put it on the calendar we could have as little as a week to prepare for the vote
1074553 rumors have been circulating around capitol hill that a few activist groups have renewed their surge and have begun lobbying full force for a bill introduced by presidential candidate sen barack obama d il the bill has already passed out of the senate foreign relations committee without any public hearings and it also passed the house earlier this year it is important to note that both of these votes were voice votes which was a deliberate strategy of the congressional majority so that no record would be kept of those who voted in favor of this problematic bill
1074554 while senator barack obama struggles to keep the public in the dark about the nature of his pro u n global poverty act a recent bay area interfaith leaders luncheon was held to lobby for senate passage of the bill whose cost has been estimated at 845 billion

1074586 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
1074587 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
1074588 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
1074589 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
1074590 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed
1074591 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
1074592 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
1074593 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
1074594 this is tremendously important work since black holes can be elusive and there are only a couple of ways to weigh them accurately
1074595 its reassuring that two very different ways to measure the mass of a big black hole give such similar answers
1074596 it was wonderful to finally see convincing evidence of the effects of the huge black hole that we expected
1074597 we were thrilled that our new technique worked just as well as the more traditional approach for weighing the black hole
1074598 monster black holes like this one power spectacular light shows in the distant early universe but not in the local universe
1074599 so we cant wait to apply our new method to other nearby galaxies harboring such inconspicuous black holes
1074600 there is an astronomer joke that goes to understand the universe we examine galaxies for radiation gases temperatures chemical constitution and much more
1074601 the stronger observed rotation of the quasar light with a higher redshift is on a longer path and can be ascribed to the subsequently greater probability of coming into contact with other galaxies
1074602 a galaxys magnetic field has to develop much more rapidly during its evolution than we previously assumed a lasting equilibrium then appears at a relatively early stage
1074603 i could imagine that the methodology we recently introduced and the combination of faraday rotation measurements and data from telescopes like the vlt might open a new window into the distant universe
1074604 if those resistant strains begin to propagate then thats when were going to be in trouble because we dont have any anti virals active against them
1074605 so we should have something as a backup and thats exactly why were working on this
1074606 in light of the urgency to find drugs to combat this virus were hopeful that our results will assist in that effort
1074607 they give us a real picture of the protein but its just one picture
1074608 the treatment of receptor flexibility with molecular dynamics simulations played a critical role in understanding the mechanism of action for this new class of inhibitors
1074609 the general idea is that we will be able to make a better drug through the strategic targeting of multiple active site pockets
1074610 importantly half of these compounds would have been neglected based on the crystal structure simulations alone many of these drug leads would only have been found through the use of this computational method
1074611 we will capture or kill osama bin laden some day you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general

1074634 no cambar mucho el equipo pero s quiero que el equipo sea ofensivo que ac en calama metan en una arco al equipo contrario la visita tiene la opci n de hacer tiempo de especular pero el local siempre debe hacer un esfuerzo doble y eso ya se los dije a mis jugadores el esfuerzo debe ser doble
1074635 algunos tienen mucha actitud como oscar cornejo iv n guillauma el bloque defensivo ellos hicieron esfuerzos b rbaros pero no alcanza tiene que ser colectivo muchos dicen salimos cansados pero no se dan cuenta de que caminaron gran parte del partido y tiene que hacer un esfuerzo colectivo y parejo hay deseos de salir de esta situaci n y para eso estamos nosotros como cuerpo t cnico para revertirlo
1074636 si se puede s s que este equipo no se concentr contra antofagasta y tuvo una derrota dolorosa pero vamos a pelear para que el equipo est en condiciones m nimas es complicado porque si no hay dinero no se puede pedir mucho
1074637 llego a un gran equipo a una ciudad acostumbrada a tener equipos ganadores s muy bien lo que representa esta camiseta y se los hice saber a los jugadores y toda la gente debe

1074639 la huelga legal del sindicato hace que los trabajadores involucrados no trabajen pero eso no tiene que ver con que los equipos funcionen o no funcionen
1074640 si es que la derecha vota en contra y tiene que asumir el costo frente a todos los chilenos le respondo a allamand que esto no es una pistola de agua es una metralleta contra los chilenos que andan en micro
1074641 a partir de octubre vamos a buscar la opci n presidencial de la udi y si es una contribuci n a la alianza y encarna bien el proyecto de la udi va a seguir hasta la primera vuelta no tenemos contemplada primarias y creemos que puede ser muy conveniente para la alianza el poder presentar dos candidatos fuertes
1074642 siempre he sido partidario que hay una solo candidato la otra vez hubo dos candidatos sebasti n pi era y yo efectivamente sumamos muchos votos pero cuando llega el momento de centrar los votos hay un porcentaje que se pierde por los roces que se crean
1074643 me parece que joaqu n lav n est pensando en hacer alguna forma de competencia que no signifique machucarse como pas en la primera vuelta anterior donde se dijeron cosas que dejaron heridas y que no cicatrizaron tan f cilmente
1074644 sebasti n pi era no va a tener rival para la primaria
1074645 yay looks good good job you did real good woo
1074646 pero esta situaci n de postergar y postergar en lo nico que se traduce es en una desinversi n en un deterioro permanente en una degradaci n de las condiciones en las que funcionan estos colegios y eso no es aceptable es realmente vergonzoso que sigamos manteniendo colegios que no tienen hace 30 a os inversiones importantes
1074647 no hay ning n plazo hasta el momento pero ella la ministra jim nez dijo que iba a hacer todo lo posible para que incluso se pudiera cambiar la ley de presupuesto para de una u otra forma apoyar y dar recursos al instituto nacional
1074648 nosotros esperamos que la ministra act e que el ministerio de educaci n intervenga dentro del instituto nacional porque hasta el momento no hay ning n ente gubernamental que est preocupado por lo menos de la crisis por la que est pasando el instituto nacional
1074649 s que en estos momentos han aparecido muchas personas a nivel de medios comprometi ndose pero muchas de esas personas y por favor no me pidan nombres muchas de esas personas se comprometieron muchos a os atr s
1074650 hay ex presidentes de la rep blica que claramente ten an informaci n de la realidad del colegio
1074651 given the forecast for tropical storm edouard shell will begin limited evacuations of approximately 40 personnel from some of its gulf of mexico west operations area today monday
1074652 no further evacuations are planned at this time and based on current information and forecast we do not expect any impact on shell operated production in the gulf of mexico
1074653 we had to do something we think the usta and what they have to bring on so many levels is the best partner
1074654 they can invest money in the event the money will come back to them
1074655 the game like a lot of businesses is you get bigger or you get smaller
1074656 its hard to be in the middle there needs to be a lot of improvement to move the tournaments forward to partner with the usta theres a lot more resources clout and influence it will help us immensely
1074657 they wouldnt be doing it if they didnt think it could grow
1074658 im excited for the area everyone wants to be part of something growing and were headed in the right direction
1074659 as a well known financial player arqaam will act as a new channel for regional and international investors to access the growing range of securities listed on the difx we look forward to building a close relationship with arqaam through its headquarters in the dubai international financial centre difc
1074660 our membership of the difx will play a central role in our offering to clients who wish to take part in the strong economic growth story underway in the middle east
1074661 the difx is building momentum as the regions international exchange and we believe this unique listing platform will offer a growing range of exciting regional and international investment possibilities
1074662 theres an intricate pattern in which this accused helped in the preparation of and transportation of the leadership that made this possible
1074663 not one witness said he had any role in the terrorist attacks themselves
1074664 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1074665 they were sort of going under the radar but its not a huge surprise
1074666 the more players in the game the better it helps bring the cost down and it helps make electric vehicles accessible so were glad to hear the news
1074667 the market is just there there are people desperate to get these vehicles
1074668 so far this has had a good impact so if bmw joins the game too thats great
1074669 the goal of having no meca team members present was to prevent them from being asked any questions that could reveal information before nasa is ready to make an announcement sources say
1074670 the bush administrations presidential science advisors office however has been briefed on the new information that nasa hopes to release as early as mid august
1074671 not true meca results have not been discussed at the white house
1074672 there is no one who knows either on the phoenix project in tucson or at nasa hq who knows where this information came from
1074673 they had nothing new to report the story was about water ice
1074674 we do not know of any briefing from nasa to ostp about science results from mars phoenix
1074675 we are attempting to assess the chemicals and minerals that make up the soil composition
1074676 we are now about halfway through the process and there are several conflicting points of view this is not a good time to go public with half the story
1074677 the story is what he says in his sworn testimony if its truthful it would support mr simpsons defense
1074678 shows the prosecution is stretching to try to fill holes in an otherwise weak and crumbling case
1074679 he seemed like a person who was happy to have a job was committed to doing it well and didnt stand out in any way in terms of having anger issues or having any other issues
1074680 we are very thorough in our assessments and there was nothing we could have foreseen
1074681 its not so much convincing people who have walked away from us
1074682 its engaging people who dont think of ford as a car brand
1074683 given where we were and where we needed to get to i felt someone from outside would break some molds
1074684 ford has to change a lot for a maverick approach like farleys to take hold
1074685 saving ford has to appeal to ones ego rather than playing it relatively safe at toyota
1074686 but helping toyota rack up another 12 billion in profits isnt much of a legacy
1074687 he was talking to people losing a lot of hope
1074688 while it played well with some it put a lot of others off
1074689 there was one slogan we all knew that wasnt in the room
1074690 but wed have to be nuts to think the smartest people in the world are all parking their cars in dearborn
1074691 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that

1074693 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
1074694 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
1074695 and they want to know what is going on in athletes personal lives
1074696 i dont think anybodys lives are private or personal anymore
1074697 once you step into the public street everything is wide open
1074698 now you have gone almost full circle on this kind of stuff and i dont see it changing because what few standards are left are just diminishing and diminishing week by week it seems so how will it ever come back unless there is a total sea change in the way that publications begin to look at things thats certainly not going to happen for years and years now

1074720 this difference in the legal systems can be confusing many people are unaware of the many implications and benefits to businesses that arise out of difcs decision to adopt the common law system and not the civil law system
1074721 for all these reasons we felt there was a tremendous opportunity to communicate with difc stakeholders particularly uae businesses and financial services firms about the laws and regulations that govern activity in difc as well as to discuss any new changes revisions and additions to these laws
1074722 the recent developments have opened a completely new world of opportunities for companies in the uae and the region to raise capital necessary for their growth from global markets
1074723 the difx will gain further momentum as the international exchange serving its region through new listings and strengthening links to individual and institutional investors the growth of the exchange supports dubai s role as a financial centre and the development of the capital markets across the middle east

1074741 it caused many potential foreign investors who were planning to set up their businesses in malaysia to review their plans this shows that anwar doesnt care and will do whatever it takes to become the prime minister
1074742 anwar has now shown his true colours he is a man who cannot be trusted and i hope the malays will fight him by rejecting him in the coming by election in permatang pauh

1074767 we want to send a strong message to the new government the northern territory intervention is an abuse of power by the previous government we as aboriginal people need to stand together to be heard as one
1074768 protests in canberra over federal intervention in the northern territory could mar the first ever welcome to country ceremony for the opening of federal parliament meanwhile a delegation of aboriginal people from central australia said they would march on parliament on tuesday week demanding an immediate review of the nt intervention and restoration of the racial discrimination act
1074769 the day before mr rudd makes his apology demonstrators plan to converge on canberra to protest against the government intervention into northern territory aboriginal communities organisers claim endorsement for their cause from the nsw reconciliation council the nsw aboriginal land council the nsw teachers federation getup and amnesty international
1074770 theyre going down there as angry and sad people because of whats been happening to them in the northern territory they want to be able to sit down and talk to politicians because this legislation took not even one day to pass through parliament so were going down there to hopefully meet a lot of politicians and tell them how we feel and why it should be stopped
1074771 a delegation of aboriginal people from central australia will lobby the federal government to overturn the northern territory intervention when parliament resumes next month
1074772 the head of the most powerful aboriginal organisation in the northern territory has criticised the federal intervention in remote indigenous communities saying it has increased violence alcohol abuse and suicides
1074773 the central land council says better policing and education on aboriginal land would be more helpful than removing permits
1074774 reconciliation australia co chairman mick dodson has called on the federal government to bring forward its proposed review of the commonwealth intervention in the northern territory professor dodson says the parts of the intervention that breach the anti discrimination act should be dropped

1074786 our new survey confirms what ive been hearing from the domestic violence community for a long time that abuse doesnt stop when the victim walks out the door one phone call one malicious report can keep a victim trapped in a cycle of abuse and harassment for years it is time we take action to raise awareness of this problem and prosecute abusers for this type of harassment
1074787 it is common practice for perpetrators of domestic violence to threaten their victims with the loss of their children if they dare to leave them many abusers use the child welfare system to make good on their threats the voices of women organizing project vow is documenting cases of malicious reports by batterers and we hope to work with the public advocates office and domestic violence advocates to discourage this form of harassment and abuse
1074788 my ex husband was sent to jail for his violence against me and my children while in jail he made a false and malicious report of child abuse against me my home felt invaded when the police responded to the report and my children were interrogated i felt re victimized this false and malicious report caused a lot of pain for me and my children making false reports is a crime and i want to see that perpetrators are prosecuted and that justice prevails

1074810 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
1074811 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
1074812 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
1074813 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
1074814 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
1074815 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
1074816 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
1074817 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
1074818 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
1074819 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
1074820 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
1074821 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
1074822 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation

1075025 outspoken artist representative fred wilhelms has posted his thoughts on tuesdays internet radio music royalties specifically concerning his own legislative representative senator bob corker r tn
1075026 it was clear corker my senator wasnt in favor of the internet radio equality act and had aligned himself with the forces of darkness marshaled behind the perform act the competing bill endorsed by the riaa and soundexchange which sets the royalties at fair market value which of course means the crb gets to set them wherever they want
1075027 i work for recording artists and songwriters i firmly believe that artists deserve to be paid compensation for the commercial exploitation of their creations almost all of my clients are outside the present day musical mainstream they arent heard often on terrestrial radio and that tells me they wouldnt be heard often on an internet radio landscape populated by only the same broadcasters the high crb rates insure that they will be unheard artists deserve to be compensated when their music is played by webcasters they cant be compensated if the webcasters arent there to play the music
1075028 casts a spotlight on radios failure to compensate the artists and musicians the contrasts could not be more stark 24 billion for corporate radios ownership not a penny for americas artists and musicians
1075029 free radio airplay of music by clear channel and thousands of local radio stations has generated riaa and recording artists we continue to question why the riaa would support a prohibitive tax on the very broadcasters who represent the recording industrys number one promotional platform

1075140 i think we both agree no issue is more important to families in in response kagens campaign manager casey frary said the lawmaker would be happy to hold a town hall meeting with gard
1075141 when john returns the 50 000 hes taken from oil and gas special interests
1075142 im sure congressman kagen would be happy to hold a town hall with him so congressman kagen can discuss how hes voted to eliminate special tax breaks for oil companies crack down on oil speculators who drive up prices and encourage the oil companies to increase production by drilling in the 56 million acres on which they already own leases to drill across america
1075143 drill already drill everywhere we need it and we need it now
1075144 and the speaker is just doing her best to avoid it and thats not going to work when this is an issue that cuts across so many political lines more than immigration more even than health care
1075145 shes the speaker of the house not the speaker of the democratic caucus
1075146 she could have avoided this whole thing by giving us a chance to talk about it last week but instead she shut us down early and got out of town and so were here and her members are back in the district getting an earful from their constituents
1075147 anything that drives this point home every single day is worth doing
1075148 a lot of the democrats agree with us but speaker pelosi is manipulating the rules and abusing the process to keep us from having a straight up or down vote
1075149 this is an issue that the democrats used to vilify us and weve now been vindicated were for exploration and production and while they attacked us for environmental irresponsibility many of them now understand we needed to be doing this years ago
1075150 this is democracy at its worst and at its best
1075151 drill now is not a hoax is not a mirage its real life the price at the pump is real life
1075152 in my district we feel this impact every single day from school buses to military bases to infrastructure most fiscal budgets that looked ahead to estimate fuel costs for all of these organizations were drastically unprepared for this current crisis our constituents cant carry out their plans for their family budget their small business or any other organization this issue hits everyone who doesnt have access to mass transit
1075153 because we dont have the visuals because we cant have cameras on the floor even though speaker pelosi could of course permit them if she wanted the coverage for this wont be as good as wed like but were here because this issue is so important and i know our constituents will appreciate that

1075156 more booze than ive ever seen before but no broads whats wrong with you guys where are the hookers
1075157 and what they have reported to us is that is that there is not an increase in that kind of traffic
1075158 there is so much going on i dont know that there is a lot of unstructured time to be involved in any other activities
1075159 we dont have to come up with whole new technologies and novel methods of doing these sorts of things we can produce energy and reduce our
1075160 we found that biogas energy can produce about 2 5 percent of all the electricity consumed in the u s which is significant and that we can displace about four percent of the greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector
1075161 what we could do is take this manure which right now is an environmental liability and turn it into a commodity this is very appealing for agricultural operations its feasible its been done in other countries we could do it here
1075162 overall you get a net effect of saving over 100 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year if were able to get all that manure and put it into action as an energy source
1075163 ethanol production or even biodiesel production uses a food source and this has caused problems worldwide particularly for the food shortages were seeing this year
1075164 is how feasible this might be but it looks very feasible for these concentrated animal feeding operations where you have a lot of manure in one place anyway
1075165 it does cost some money however you have to buy the equipment but in an era of high electricity prices and high gas prices this becomes more economical than ever before
1075166 people often ask is this new technology or is it expensive its not new technology its been demonstrated for decades in countries like germany its an age old process people have known about it for a long time
1075167 were trying to find ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and we often think of difficult long term multi decade high technology solutions but it turns out the solution might be laying on the ground around us
1075168 maybe obese people can become normal in their sugars without necessarily losing the weight
1075169 obviously losing weight is the optimum way to go but maybe along the way while theyre working towards that goal we can help with a little bit of these natural remedies
1075170 we noticed a very significant drop in their blood sugars so basically after two weeks of consuming curcumin orally their diabetes was essentially gone
1075171 doctors have known for a very very long time that theres a negative impact of being overweight and actually underweight on a womans reproductive capability and in the recent years with ivf in vitro fertilization being very very prevalent studies have come out that show that women who seem to be very very good on paper dont do as well as we would expect with regard to the number of eggs that we may retrieve from them or their ability to become pregnant with ivf techniques if theyre overweight so ive always been very interested about trying to discern why women who are overweight have difficulty becoming pregnant and my interest in that sort of brought me into the diabetes and obesity center here
1075172 there are scientific studies that have shown that have been done of various degrees of rigor that show that turmeric and curcumin really do have significant benefits in inflammatory conditions
1075173 there are innumerable stories of patients ive known many of whom are in the prime of their lives and who ultimately succumb to cancer because in many cases it was just fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle are excited about a discovery that may be the most promising way to detect cancer early with a simple blood test
1075174 ultimately the goal of all of this kind of research is to detect cancer early enough so that it can be cured
1075175 in addition to that other labs had published some research also in the last few years not looking at micro rnas in blood but looking at micro rnas in tissues that had been stored for long periods of time and tissues in which the other kinds of rna molecules get degraded and they also had found began to report that these micro rnas are quite stable in these tissues
1075176 we then wanted to ask even though we could find micro rnas in healthy people could there be micro rnas in patients with cancer that were different than the ones that were there in healthy people
1075177 in a large majority of the cases just by measuring the amount of micro rna in the blood we could tell who had cancer and who didnt
1075178 we havent developed a final blood test for detecting prostate cancer especially not at an early stage
1075179 but what we are very excited about is that its proved the concept its proved the idea that not only are micro rnas present in the blood and stable there but micro rnas arising from tumors can get into the bloodstream and actually do get into the blood stream at levels high enough that we can detect them and it in our minds opens up the possibility that this concept or this approach might be applied not to just prostate cancer but other types of cancer
1075180 although thats an important line of investigation it has some limitations and one of the limitations is that proteins are quite difficult to identify and to detect its of course very possible to do that but its a lot of work to figure out a way to even detect one protein in a very accurate manner
1075181 its very possible that the kinds of micro rnas that are circulating in the blood might reflect something about the tumor which might tell us which treatments might work better than others
1075182 the blood tests that we would love to find are ones in which were not only detecting the cancer but also finding those micro rnas which are involved in actually causing the cancer because those rnas it might be possible to manipulate them in some way or treat the cancer even in some way by treating the micro rnas
1075183 i dont know when thats going to be and theres a lot of work ahead and a lot of challenges
1075184 but absolutely thats the goal and thats why we do what we do
1075185 the thing i love about jazz is that in many ways its so unscientific
1075186 you know when you listen to jazz what you realize is that these musicians they really live by breaking the rules by sort of rejecting excessive control over what theyre going to do and i think for a scientist who sort of thrives on controlling variables and really having a clear sense of order in all things the freedom that really characterizes jazz its an unusual mix
1075187 the mental state the creative state that youre in when youre improvising is entirely different than when youre playing something that youve learned by memory
1075188 as a jazz musician for most of my life ive always wondered what takes place inside my head when im actually improvising something
1075189 improvisation was associated with this very very similar brain response independent of level of complexity
1075190 so the really key part of our paper is that improvisation the unique state in which youre spontaneously generating new ideas and playing them musically has a kind of characteristic signature neural state which were looking at when we do these functional scans we think we really honed in on what is going on in the brain during improvisation
1075191 this is a broad expanse of brain that basically shut down during improvisation
1075192 one of the things its closely involved in is in self monitoring and sort of conscious evaluation of what youre doing so for example to judge the appropriateness or correctness of your behavior this area would be active
1075193 what you want is to just generate ideas and you dont really want to worry too much about whether they sounded right
1075194 you dont want to be too inhibited by that and i think that these musicians are so proficient that theyre able to enter this creative state where theyre essentially uninhibited rather easily
1075195 although theres a tendency to want to very much romanticize artistic creation kind of put it on the level of magic or something mystical while there may be mystical and magical aspects to it they are products of brain function
1075196 and without making that sound mundane i think that what weve done is try to address the fact that well it might be ordinary processes within the brain that are giving rise to these extraordinary musical achievements to me it makes it in a way more appealing than to just leave it in the kind of abstract realm of something mystical
1075197 and on the other hand i think music is so mathematical that when we start to put all these things together you know the logic and structure of music the freedom of jazz and combine that with the fact that theyre all really products of the human brain there is sort of a logical correlation that well if its a product of the brain we should use tools to study the brain to assess something even something thats as seemingly random as jazz
1075198 at least we stopped the bleeding thats the good news
1075199 the bad news is new yorks 1 point gain pales in comparison to the nations 5 point increase
1075200 optimism rebounded slightly but growing numbers of consumers are reluctant to translate hope into buying cars trucks or homes the percentage of new yorkers intending to purchase major items today is down between 10 percent and 40 percent with cars down 40 percent
1075201 we can design materials that have properties that that have never been available before never been discovered before
1075202 we were using 15 000 times more solvent than in terms of mass of solvent than actual material we were purifying
1075203 as we start to scale up the hazards of those materials become much more important the waste generated just multiplies
1075204 to commercialize these materials we have to find solutions that make the processes more convenient much more efficient and safer
1075205 we have for the first time in a new technology the opportunity to try to get these things right the first time rather than proceeding with inefficient and unsafe methods and then having to clean up the mess afterward
1075206 activities and progress toward hava help america vote act compliance are in jeopardy
1075207 continues to identify time and schedule as major constraints and risks to the successful timely completion of the project
1075208 the state sets the highest bar in the nation for approval of voting machines one that vendors have never been required to meet before their performance in new york demonstrates that they are a long long way from understanding that the public will not stand for poorly designed badly tested and outrageously overpriced equipment and a business philosophy of let the customer be damned
1075209 socially undesirable behaviors like drug use or high risk sexual activity or even crimes are more likely to be reported when we dont have to face people directly and say those words
1075210 theyre not afraid to put their hands on a computer to try new things and we actually had many teens ask us questions about what else could the tablets do
1075211 is particularly hard for those teens who might have a long standing relationship with their pediatrician and dont want to hurt their feelings or upset them talking about behaviors that they know they shouldnt be engaging in
1075212 physicians when theyre given good information information thats hard to get from children in a normal visit are very much more willing to start to work with those teens in beginning to address those behaviors
1075213 there have been a number of cases from around the country where techniques werent properly done where there were miscarriages of justice
1075214 several of our volunteers had several outliers that is characteristics which occurred in less than one percent of the sampling this doesnt provide an identification to the exclusion of all others but does demonstrate that there is a scientific basis for opinion testimony
1075215 its a start in the right direction but this has to be continued for many hundred of thousands or maybe even millions of samples so that we could get an adequate population database
1075216 if you have dna from the bite mark thats ideal and thats what should be used
1075217 but in cases where dna has been degraded or lost bite mark patterns are still valuable evidence that should be collected if there is a bite mark and you ignore it thats not the right thing to do all evidence should be gathered and examined for any potential information it might provide
1075218 i should have already the day before the night before done grocery shopping and obviously gone to the pharmacy whenever necessary i should get up in the morning and cook vegetables and the proper protein and have the proper food available for that day and plan out the whole day when i leave the house in the morning im gone for 14 to16 hours so that means that all my medicines for the entire day have to be with me and they have to be refrigerated or they have to be kept cold that goes for things like needles and my glucometer and the test strips and then i should be trying to figure out how to get at least 30 minutes of vigorous exercise in that day
1075219 thats a day when i havent broken down and eaten like a one by one inch sliver of cake at somebodys birthday party or i havent eaten a mango or some kind of fruit that really messes up my sugar but if you can imagine doing that every single day and having that regimen every single day its very tiring you get used to it but people around you dont get used to it and if you travel or if youre invited to someones house its a major undertaking traveling is terrible you just have to prepare for so many eventualities
1075220 thats a terrible thing to do to deliberately put on weight in order to qualify for gastric bypass
1075221 with some operations like gastric bypass or similar procedures the remission of diabetes is very quick after surgery which even precedes the weight loss
1075222 and this occurs even without taking medications anymore so this is what we call a remission maybe not a cure but certainly a remission and this is unprecedented in the history of diabetes that is a striking observation that i think actually gives us a lot of responsibilities because we need to find out why this is occurring and at a time when diabetes is increasing in incidence we must understand why this happens and how can we offer not just surgery but anything that we learn from this experience to more patients than are actually offered hope today
1075223 even those animals that have no obesity but they are still diabetic they do have an improvement following surgeries that are very similar to gastric bypass
1075224 very recently we have seen diabetes surgery being applied to patients that are not obese with very satisfying rates of remission rubino says
1075225 we cant say that there is a cure for diabetes yet because technically speaking to say that there is a cure we should be able to know that we are actually dealing with the cause of diabetes
1075226 unfortunately the cause of diabetes is not known yet so we can say that in a clinical point of view surgical remission of diabetes really looks like a cure but we cant speak about a cure yet
1075227 its clear that we are facing one of the most fascinating opportunities we have ever had in the history of this disease and i think its not an option to ignore that possibility
1075228 when i discovered that dr rubino had come to this country and that he indeed was going to pursue this i sat in my office and cried
1075229 i just couldnt believe it i would be very discouraged right now but im not im hopeful i think this surgery is going to become available some way somehow for me
1075230 this is about getting well this is about extending our lives
1075231 so this suggests that the fat tissue itself is an important component of what happens in caloric restriction
1075232 interestingly there is also a study in humans where they did only the fat with liposuction and it really didnt have measurable metabolic effects so what we see in rats is kind of similar to what we see in humans
1075233 most plastics are made from oil based resources and just as the price of gas goes up the price of plastics go up as these resources become more and more precious
1075234 carbon dioxide is extremely inexpensive arguably for most resources its a free chemical compound
1075235 these plastics can be used for basically anything where common plastics are currently used
1075236 they also have many special applications because they decompose really cleanly when you heat them so making ceramics high tech electronics making cast iron and cast aluminum engines these plastics have a lot of really important potential uses
1075237 the customer would take it into solution put it in place it holds stuff in place during the manufacturing operation and then when theyre done with that they heat it up a little bit and the polymer just goes away leaving little or no residue behind nothing to interfere with the manufacturing parts
1075238 its a novel material no other materials can perform like that
1075239 its important that if you have to use a lot of the catalyst or if the catalyst is really expensive if the catalyst is really slow that making the polymer becomes very expensive so ideally you want a catalyst that converts the feedstocks into the plastic in a very quick time scale so if youve got a really expensive chemical factory you dont have to wait for weeks worth of reactions to take place
1075240 our catalyst is significantly faster than any of the other catalysts that are out there
1075241 nature makes its plastics out of carbon dioxide completely although it does a lot of chemical processing and using photosynthesis
1075242 in our plastics we have to use another molecule because carbon dioxide itself has very little driving force so its a very stable compound so we have to add these helper molecules to make the plastic form which at the current time is based on oil
1075243 one of the things were doing at novomer is trying to find non oil based resources for this other part of the polymer so that at the end the entire plastic will be made out of renewable substances
1075244 if somebody were to use this plastic and accidentally leave it in the environment unlike polyethylene or some of the other common polymers thatll exist in the environment for decades if not centuries these polymers degrade under relatively short time scales
1075245 so we wont have unwanted plastic dispersed in our environment
1075246 for example we see opportunities to blend our materials with other biodegradable plastics giving better properties farther down the timeline but waste stream and end of life issues are complex we dont like to imply that people are off the hook for their behavior so the chemistry that makes biodegradable plastic is just part of the solution
1075247 of the oil that we use every year about 90 percent is used for energy the other 10 percent is used by the chemical industry of that 10 percent about 90 percent is used to make plastics
1075248 this might help in reducing the amount of co2 that enters the atmosphere but realistically its only going to make a very small dent
1075249 to be able to take somebodys waste product and turn it into something thats really useful is great
1075250 what we wanted to do is develop a personal exposure monitor that primarily children could wear 24 hours a day or have near them 24 hours a day so that we could measure their exposure
1075251 to data log and to track whats going on with the different chemicals over time
1075252 the real engineering feat i think is getting all of those sensors to actually work together in a single box because they werent designed to function together
1075253 that we put the vest on and then were able to put in known amounts of the gasses we expect to be detecting and measure it in a simulated real world situation
1075254 from the desktop unit we learned how crafty children can be with instrumentation
1075255 sensor technology is changing very quickly and so theres more advanced sensors smaller sensors that can allow us to move on to more advanced equipment
1075256 our answer is that middle class families and our working poor must not be forced to bear the brunt of such cuts i and my assembly colleagues believe that this state must not backpedal on the important progress we have made for the hardworking families of this state
1075257 it took linda stender five days to give back the 6 000 donated to her by assemblyman neil cohen but it has been 21 days since stender fundraiser and supporter rep charlie rangel was reported to be under investigation for sweetheart housing deals and unethical fundraising practices linda stender should continue to cleanse herself of all of her questionable campaign contributions and return the more than 20 000 she received from rangel and cancel her fundraiser with him

1075259 unfortunately for years these drivers had no coverage whatsoever and many have suffered hardships due to injury assaults robberies and even murder on the job
1075260 an enormous and completely unsustainable run up in state spending
1075261 at the same time there was a tremendous burst of tax revenues fed by a boom on wall street and there was also a real estate bubble which burst
1075262 and what we need to do now is undo that excessive spending because the 5 billion budget gap that was being projected in may which the governor no doubt will announce today is worse that gap was entirely due almost entirely due to projected increases in base line spending
1075263 but now were getting to the point here where we need to see some very real consistent actions
1075264 while we agree that the economy is weakening and state government must rise up to meet this challenge as part of next years budget property taxpayers are facing a crisis right now earlier today i notified members of the senate that we will be returning to albany on august 8th to convene a special session to enact the governors property tax cap and pass legislation to reduce costs for schools and ensure adequate resources for students
1075265 the governor plans to turn this around hes set a course toward financial stability its not an easy course there will be pain and it will take time it took us years to get here and it will take us years to get back delay only increases the degree of difficulty
1075266 now that the governor has brought this fiscal crisis to the publics attention the hard work and the tough choices must begin more than ever we need this governor to lead and make the tough choices if making those choices and standing up to the special interests results in his being a one term governor then he would likely go down in history as the person who righted new yorks ship of state and we would owe him a debt of gratitude

1075269 we are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on that vehicle
1075270 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight falcon 1 flight 3 on the plus side the flight of our first stage with the new merlin 1c engine that will be used in falcon 9 was picture perfect unfortunately a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together this is under investigation and i will send out a note as soon as we understand exactly what happened
1075271 the most important message id like to send right now is that spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward we have flight four of falcon 1 almost ready for flight and flight five right behind that i have also given the go ahead to begin fabrication of flight six falcon 9 development will also continue unabated taking into account the lessons learned with falcon 1 we have made great progress this past week with the successful nine engine firing

1075433 de dichter trekt zich terug na zijn ontdekking dat zomerzinnen geen low budget drents festivalletje maar een groots opgezet evenement is
1075434 wat ik niet snap is waarom de auteurs en dichters uit drenthe en groningen die voor dit drentse festival gevraagd zijn geacht worden hun optreden zelf te subsidi ren een vreemd iets wat je wel vaker in groningen en drenthe meemaakt voor veel geld worden uit artiesten uit het westen ingevlogen en regionaal talent mag blij wezen er voor nop te mogen staan

1075485 normaliter reageer ik nooit op berichten op internetsites maar dit keer kan ik niet anders bij dit artikel over de gedeeltelijke zonsverduistering staat de slechtste foto die je maar kan bedenken iemand die met een cd en zelfs via het gat in de cd rechtstreeks naar de zon kijkt een recept voor oogbeschadigingen ik hoop niet dat iemand die dit bericht leest ge nspireerd door jullie foto op dezelfde manier zodadelijk naar de zon kijkt

1075692 you can feel the energy of this tree you can feel the spirit and the history its alive it has life running through it
1075693 dont you have to trim the tree does it damage the house the roof

1075702 cathy i am so sorry i wish there was a way i do thank you for calling me though i hope only the best for you and the little house it will be ok i just know it
1075703 cathy remember cathy from the little house in harbor springs
1075704 well sniffle cathy called and said that its still for sale and shes about to move and if we dont buy it she just knows that somebody will knock the house and the council tree down and
1075705 she said that she is willing to lower the price to 219 000
1075706 really and she said that its just intuitive that we are the ones to save that tree
1075707 lauren please calm down listen you know this i just think it would be so much money the upkeep it would be stressful and wed have no extra spending cash let alone time wed have to always be up there fixing and maintaining the house its just too much im sorry
1075708 dont feel bad this isnt your responsibility she just wants to sell her house someday if we have the extra money and time well get a place up there i have to go now but lets talk later
1075709 ive been worrying about this all year jon i just felt so badly that i couldnt help to save this place
1075710 you dont have to feel bad dont you think with all of the odawas millions of dollars from the tribal casino and resort in peotosky wouldnt they just buy this place in a heartbeat if it meant something
1075711 they could buy the house like it was candy stop worrying
1075712 madness is a lot like gravity all it takes is a little push

1075716 because our sense of self and of the possibilities intensities ideas that we perceive are formed as a result of past syntheses for deleuze the passive synthesis that is formed by the third most resistant form of repetition is most important here of habit and memory they and we are unable to represent themselves fully
1075717 more in terms of displacement and production and desire as affirmation
1075718 such a definition would cut ideas off from one another and deny their necessary connection
1075719 events are a matter not of the revelation of an essential truth or core but of relations between elements that appear to be impossible or unlikely from the point of view of such essences for deleuze an event is more of the order of the uncanny connection than the essential internal truth

1075727 because they offer a lot of government help a lot of active government help to solve the day to day problems that voters are suffering from and republicans tend to take a laissez faire approach let the problem work itself through the economy and the economy will be better off in the long run that sort of thing
1075728 so what you end up getting is a slightly clearer message from the democratic candidate saying this is what we want to do and you get a confused message from the republican candidate because on the one hand they want to say to the voters we understand and were here to help and on the other hand what they want to do is let the economy sort of go let the economy work itself out thats usually to the advantage of the democrats and i dont see that changing this year
1075729 this is the single biggest unanswered question in this campaign it seems to me
1075730 theres a clear sentiment in the polls that people are hurting theyre hurting because of the cost of gasoline theyre frustrated about the economic insecurity theyre very discouraged about the uncertainty over their pensions and their job prospects
1075731 forty years of political science research demonstrates that people within the presidents party are hurt when the economy is performing poorly even when the president is not on the ballot so mccain has to work twice as hard to get half as far on the economy and all indications are that this election is going to be won or lost on the economy
1075732 would make it much easier for companies to reuse containers also it would help pave the way toward more uniform recycling standards

1075736 its a wonderful district and i enjoyed the challenges of the job but after 33 years in the business and 15 as a school superintendent i think it might be time
1075737 i dont know if the board itself will do the search or if we will hire somebody else or an outside search organization
1075738 we had eagle do the search for us then we went to our then superintendent harv peris to recommend people whom he thought would do the job and thats how we met dr manaseri

1075759 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
1075760 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1075761 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
1075762 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1075763 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1075764 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1075765 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1075766 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1075767 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season

1075773 not comment on speculation about future products or product development
1075774 these acquisitions are a strategic fit for mmc as they provide us with a competitive advantage in the utilities and infrastructure businesses
1075775 the acquisitions will enable us to be an integrated water and power producer in the global arena and allow us to compete more effectively in these fast growing markets
1075776 with a comprehensive air sea and land transportation system we are optimistic that the region will become more attractive to international investors
1075777 malaysia actually remains a pretty attractive market but the recent political uncertainties make people like us hesitant to invest
1075778 it doesnt help that investors are not really going for emerging markets these days so malaysia is not necessarily a place people need to be in right now theres a lot of money sitting on the sidelines
1075779 i would say politics is the single biggest thing weighing on the market we have been a net seller since the general election in march

1075794 i think hes going to be a good source of information
1075795 i was on krfu then while in school and worked as an intern on kmox in st louis
1075796 hes certainly been as big an icon and big part of the franchise as any player or manager
1075797 hes been through it all and he had a very unique style
1075798 i think people appreciated his honesty and his irreverence at times you never knew what you were going to get with skip it could be very factual or it could be very funny
1075799 i had just spoken with skip this week when we did the radio show and i didnt know he wasnt feeling well he seemed in his normal good spirits
1075800 i thought really this past week he had more energy and was sounding more like himself than in past years he didnt come to the ballpark friday because he wasnt feeling well but from what we heard it was like he had a cold
1075801 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1075802 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
1075803 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
1075804 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for his family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
1075805 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
1075806 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
1075807 from now on the republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the negro vote and they dont need any more than that but republicans would be shortsighted if they weakened enforcement of the voting rights act the more negroes who register as democrats in the south the sooner the negrophobe whites will quit the democrats and become republicans thats where the votes are without that prodding from the blacks the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local democrats
1075808 the truth is that there was very little that was subconscious about the g o p s relentless appeal to racist whites tired of losing elections it saw an opportunity to renew itself by opening its arms wide to white voters who could never forgive the democratic party for its support of civil rights and voting rights for blacks

1075817 the ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy instead of diminishing evil it multiplies it through violence you may murder the liar but you cannot murder the lie nor establish the truth through violence you may murder the hater but you do not murder hate in fact violence merely increases hate so it goes returning violence for violence multiplies violence adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that hate multiplies hate violence multiplies violence and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction the chain reaction of evil hate begetting hate wars producing more wars must be broken or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation
1075818 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1075819 no dont you see i am tired of you and dont wanna try to make it work
1075820 i have dreamt and nurtured several dreams when i was a child i have dreamt of becoming a very responsible woman in a very responsible position but believe me i have never dreamt of shaking the hands of the prime minister of the united kingdom let alone having breakfast with him until several days turned into months and into years and i was still not waking from the dream i thought i was having before i realized it was not a dream but a reality i become excited especially when i know that people of my background rarely get such opportunities in life
1075821 i was privileged to attend several workshops and met several personalities a situation that built so much confidence in me
1075822 after months of searching i became the ultimate choice though excited i was not so surprised because my exposure with cama activities has done so much good to me my confidence rose to a level i could not describe and i know that made the magic for me
1075823 during the breakfast with mr brown i discussed with him issues such as the vulnerability of the girl child in africa the need for the african girl to have formal education how poverty in africa affects girl child education
1075824 the vulnerability is of more concern than a slow server
1075825 this will make it cheaper and easier for businesses and families operating in africa and the middle east
1075826 recognizing our communitys great interest in the convention and the desire of so many to observe activity around the pepsi center and have their views be heard by delegates we are dedicating more than a full acre of land to a public viewing area
1075827 the area will be able to accommodate several thousand people at one time our intention is to maximize opportunities for people to express themselves in a safe manner that also respects the rights of others as well as local state and federal laws

1075832 we are increasingly finding that redox proteins which counter the effects of oxidization have an important role in the bodys defense against heart disease

1075841 it wasnt anxiety i was wired from the adrenaline i was trying to self evaluate i reviewed so many conversations with other gms i had during the day how could i have handled something differently or said something differently so many elements running through my mind
1075842 at 3 55 p m we had come to the conclusion we were holding on to jason bay because we did not feel the return we were getting was appropriate then life was breathed into the dodgers red sox deal and because wed put things in place we were able to make a quick decision
1075843 it came together in a minute one question two questions and the deal was finalized
1075844 once we felt we had exhausted the ability to get the elite prospect we felt we needed to get more in terms of quantity but still searching for quality
1075845 either mannys here or hes not it became more of an issue of whether or not he was going to be here and he was pretty adamant he didnt want to be here it came down to his happiness if they had come to manny and he said he wanted to stay here hed probably still be here its kind of out of our hands im glad theres a resolution
1075846 we were in a bit of a difficult circumstance and we made something good of it
1075847 hes not a press guy and when you see his quotes every day thats something different i dont think its surprising but it was weird if dustin pedroia said the same comments we think hes a martian if manny says it people like it its front page news
1075848 would i be the only guy in the new england area that said no if i did i think im probably with the consensus its very obvious from anything you see or hear he doesnt want to be here and anytime that theres a piece of the equation you have a problem and then not trading and leaving him here is a problem because you dont know what youre going to get
1075849 its very hard to tangibly evaluate how hurt someone is id like to and still do take his word for it until someone comes up to me and says i faked the injury its kind of like barry bonds everyone has crucified him but i still have to believe hes innocent until someone proves him guilty
1075850 i enjoyed pitching with pedro but i watched pedro for a year come and go as he pleased and do whatever he pleased from a schedule standpoint and to a point all star break heading home and no one ever said a word the things that pedro said going out of town about terry that crushed me because of what i saw tito do for him mannys the same way
1075851 nobody bothers you in boston it was like from the stadium to home over here they dont make it a big deal hey hi how you doing nice hit move on over there you go straight home
1075852 he had a remarkable run here his whole career was remarkable he is one of the best right handed hitters in history and no one can ever take that away from him
1075853 we didnt leave they sent us out it wasnt our choice it was their choice
1075854 i cant take that what do you think i am juan pierre im not that fast im 5 3 to first base remember
1075855 hey i already made 160 million i like it here you know im looking for peace i got it here im blessed to be here with a bunch of great guys the team is even young i love it
1075856 the dodgers brought me here to end my career in this city at least thats what im thinking
1075857 i told him that if the rule is to get a haircut then ill get one because i dont want any special privileges but joe replied by saying that i should get an apartment and take care of my personal stuff first after which i should see a barber
1075858 torre told me that the most important references that he has of me is that im a nonstop worker and a hustler in the field
1075859 if theres a hooker you want it all comes down to price right and i think thats a better analogy
1075860 hes been outspoken on issues but weve had owners who are outspoken as well ive not heard of him referred to as a loudmouth
1075861 it was the way he presented himself to us in the interview wearing jeans and sneakers and turning his nose up and acting like he was the smartest guy in the room he was a smart aleck kid
1075862 i was surprised they obviously had a need for a bat in the lineup and another outfielder
1075863 well these guys theyre different from one to 25 you will get talked about i found out firsthand its just a matter of trying to fit in and throw my jabs at them the second day
1075864 like i explained to him he only has to go out there when he feels good and good enough to where he feels like he can give us a chance to win with him being out there but if he doesnt feel like his body is going to allow that on a particular day all hes got to do is go to ozzie
1075865 i think he wanted me to know in case i didnt know not to expect what we were used to seeing out there thats the reason i said you only play when you feel great when you dont feel great or dont feel healthy thats ok we have plenty of options i told him that its not as if hes replacing the prototypical guy that was already out there
1075866 it was fine when you only have three balls hit to you you dont have to do too much moving
1075867 listen im not trying to kid anybody about having all the answers if this works great home run if it doesnt its still a double well find a way to make it work and still have what he can give us offensively
1075868 lee has been talking to everybody about making a deal hed like to get something done if it make us a better team but i think hes prepared to not do anything he isnt going to give anyone away we arent a club that has to do things based on money im not sure everyone knows that but thats the way it is
1075869 over the last week we were very competitive for a lot of deals including bay they chose to go in a different direction
1075870 thats the nature of it i know there are some fans who are unhappy and we expect them to feel that way but when we made the decisions we made we feel like on the other side of it they would have been more unhappy with us in two years had we done any moves that were possible
1075871 for the most part there isnt much of a market rauch was our one marketable player that we traded look we are a last place team a lot of them are underachieving thats not surprising
1075872 in our position we have to sit there and listen to everybody well explore everything possible ideally you want to trade veterans for young kids thats the normal blueprint with the exception of the rauch deal thats not going to happen because we have veteran guys who have underachieved
1075873 we are going to turn the page we are going to get younger the last two months of the season and we are going to continue to develop young players we want players that are going to hustle play the game hard and play the game right we just feel we need to give younger players an opportunity we are going to do that
1075874 its disappointing i traded for him twice im a fan of his talent and his ability it didnt happen here in washington im sorry for that and im sure he is sorry for that i love felipe we just couldnt get the talent out on the field
1075875 for people who play this game its hard when you struggle you roll over a ball and you cuss yourself out down the first base line it might seem like im not hustling to other people its just frustration
1075876 kory needs to play he is the future of this organization as well as jesus they need to play giving me my release is sort of a class act by them to give me a chance to hook up with another team is a big time class act
1075877 to get released and leave everybody its not good but i understand the business and everything they just signed a couple young guys that deserve a chance just like i did when i went up i dont have nothing bad to say i wish those guys the best
1075878 we need to try a different direction with the pitching staff a different voice a different message its not that anything mark and dom said was doing anything wrong with these guys in fact in another situation another group another time i would love to work with these guys again sometimes people and players respond to different voices different messages
1075879 we felt we werent seeing the progress we wanted to see were serious about the wild card race and in fairness to our offense we needed to try to do something to improve our pitching we owe them that
1075880 people respond to different people differently we hope that this will be that situation being aggressive having a presence out there and attacking the zone and keeping the ball in play thats part of the message that well continue to send and well see how it goes
1075881 i hope this is the right decision i think the whole idea behind it was to throw out some new ideas
1075882 im a new yorker and im here i dont necessarily rush home and turn the tv on if my girls and my wife are watching on tv ill watch it im looking forward to moving past all of that to where its not an essential part of my life im just a regular dude
1075883 i dont know curt schilling other than the fact that way back when in philadelphia he said signing j d drew would be a huge mistake
1075884 this is the one guy who everybody wants all the contenders like to have a solid veteran to add to the bullpen down the stretch
1075885 i dont think were in the middle ground i think were in it when you look up and youre under eight within striking distance of the wild card and theres still two months to play i dont we ever thought about us as hey were going to be sellers weve taken on the thought process that if we continue to add without taking anything away from us going forward that we would try to do that
1075886 this guy woke up in a bathtub full of ice with his kidneys missing
1075887 waitaminnit drilling is how it works thats where you get it
1075888 my life is incomplete without you i want you to be in my life forever
1075889 seandainya bapak di sini dan nggak bercerai dengan ibu mungkin hidup kita nggak susah seperti ini dasar orang tua bodoh
1075890 nasibmu adalah kamu sendiri yang menentukan mas nggak ada sangkut pautnya dengan kesalahan dahulu
1075891 seandainya nanti ajal tiba tiba menjemput bagaimana kelak nasib kedua putraku ya
1075892 iya ya bagaimana nanti kalau bu siti meninggal terus gimana nasib heri dan indra
1075893 yeah eventually how long have i known that bird on the door she is so fucking up herself i mean get over it love youre just a glorified cloakroom attendant
1075894 ha ha yeah silly cow shes probably just waiting for her chance to nosh off one of the djs
1075895 is she brazilian theyre all shagging brazilians at the moment got to get myself one of those
1075896 what do you think of the warm up hes fucking rubbish aint he couldnt mix an omellette
1075897 yeah silly cunt hes johnnys brother in law aint he probably doesnt even get paid cab fare listen how many drink tickets did you get that cunt johnny is so tight these days doesnt realise us coming down here is what attracts the punters
1075898 theyre all greedy fuckers mate no clue whatsoever were fucking tastemakers right we spread the word i could do much better than that warm up and all i wont kiss arse though thats why i dont get the gigs theyre all fucking arselicking wankers
1075899 quite techno tonight isnt it that means loads of fucking blokes
1075900 yeah and that means no fucking decent birds and the few that are here will be fought over
1075901 and dont forget the scraps thatll kick off anyway come bar closing time
1075902 why do we still come here will we ever learn
1075903 over the last four or five years ive also broken my collarbone and my wrist but the knee injury was fairly bad last year
1075904 ive had a lot of problems holding me back and if you are missing that five per cent or even more you are just not going to last in the top races
1075905 you get to halfway and then you have to climb off
1075906 i definitely want to do a tour de france i was fairly close to it this year so hopefully it will happen next year
1075907 the olympics is the pinnacle of any sports persons career
1075908 ive worked really hard over the last five or six years and all the work has paid off now that im going to the olympics
1075909 i was absolutely ecstatic when our national team director frankie campbell contacted me to tell me that id been selected
1075910 at the time i was halfway through the 10 day tour of switzerland and the news certainly spurred me on for the second half of the race
1075911 i had no choice in the matter but to go if you want to go pro you need to go to mainland europe where cycling is almost on a par with football
1075912 i headed to marseille when i was 20 and it was a bit of a culture shock at first with the language barrier
1075913 a lot of sacrifices are made when you move away from your family and it was tough at first but you have to adapt to it
1075914 but you do have those four or five days a year when you are feeling so strong and you win a couple of races that makes it all worthwhile and going to the olympics as well will only add to that feeling
1075915 you can do training rides of up to 120 miles
1075916 it has become pretty scientfic and your weight is down to the last gram so you have to watch what you eat
1075917 there are no mcdonalds or takeaways and once you have finished training you need to rest and recover as much as possible so you try and get to bed fairly early
1075918 as regards socialising i wouldnt go out more than 10 or maybe 15 times a year and when i do its a fairly cheap night out as regards alcohol
1075919 but in the last five years there definitely has has been a big clampdown with the testing
1075920 you can see that with a lot of the top guys getting caught and the speeds are starting to slow down a little bit
1075921 of course there are always guys out there who are going to want to cheat and to get the little bit extra and they are willing to take the risk
1075922 im able to compete at a level close to the top because of the testing you just cant compete with guys who are using performance enhancing drugs given that it is such an endurance event
1075923 yes the sauce is high in lycopene but all the lycopene in the world is not going to convince me pizza is a heart healthy food
1075924 and mozzarella cheese is a good source of calcium but its also high in calories
1075925 intends to garner the attention of the millions of adults who suffered as children the very same political indifference vulnerable children in dire circumstances suffer today
1075926 who better than santa claus to advocate for children this way
1075927 wouldnt it be wonderful if enough folks visited santaslink net and shared my blogs and videos to make it crystal clear to the other candidates and pundits that they no longer can ignore our childrens plight and suffering
1075928 obama and mccain would risk losing millions of votes in a tight election simply because they refuse to address childrens issues all the while realizing there are additional millions of voters whove said they wont vote for either of them now voters have an option worth considering
1075929 love is the greatest gift of all very child deserves to be nurtured protected and loved

1075955 the american economy has often defied predictions of its demise it has done so again official figures published on thursday july 31st show that americas gdp rose at an annualised rate of 1 9 in the second quarter this would a respectable enough growth rate at the best of times that this was achieved despite the considerable handicaps of a badly damaged banking system a big jump in oil prices and the ongoing housing bust makes it remarkable
1075956 americas economy still on the right road jul 31st 2008 from economist com
1075957 the united states of america the worlds largest economy by some magnitude entered the new year in recession or teetering on the edge of one while data for early 2008 was inconclusive the us at least faces a sharp contraction in growth this year and even its first outright decline since 2001
1075958 nonfinancial corporate sector debt growth barely slowed in the first quarter debt has continued to rise relative to output but interest expenses remain extremely low at about 2 of output and other measures debt net worth and debt equity do not indicate excessive gearing that said the widening financing gap is spurring demand for loans real nonresidential investment spending growth has slowed it is little changed since early 2006 for these firms but at the same time internal cash flow has been falling in the first quarter the financing gap stood at 25 of capex it was a fairly similar 20 of capex in the first quarter of 2007 but 10 in the first quarter of 2006 and negative in the period of rapid domestic profits growth before then
1075959 and now the unavoidable bust of this bubble is going to force an effective nationalization of a good chunk of the u s financial system as no one else but the government can do the job this is why the free market ideologues at the fed treasury and white house have now become especially after the bailout of fannie and freddies shareholders management and bondholders comrade paulson comrade bernanke and the bolshevik great leader bush but then their whole approach and ideology has always been not one of free market capitalism but rather one of privatizing gains and socializing the losses or socialism for wall street the rich and the well connected
1075960 leaving aside the fact that we are going to have a pretty nasty recession and international crisis the global economy is going to grow at a sustained rate once this downturn is over there are significant financial and economic problems in the u s and thats why im bearish about the u s but the emergence of china and india and other powers is going to shift global economics and politics radically and the world is going to be more balanced in the future rather than relying on one engine which has been the u s there are big issues ahead how do you integrate the 2 2 billion chinese and indians into the global economy there will be transitional costs and the displacement of workers both blue collar and white in the advanced economies but im quite bullish about the state of the global economy and im positive about the medium and long term
1075961 tenth and final point so what is left as the only solution is the outright formal or informal nationalization of the u s financial system that effective and creeping nationalization is already underway with the variety of actions that the fed and the u s treasury have taken and that we described above so this is the paradox of this u s administration it was so rabidly and ideologically free markets oriented and averse to any sensible regulation and supervision of the financial system that its policies of being asleep at the wheel caused the biggest asset bubble and credit bubble not just in mortgages in u s history and now the unavoidable bust of this bubble is going to force an effective nationalization of a good chunk of the u s financial system as no one else but the government can do the job this is why the free market ideologues at the fed treasury and white house have now become especially after the bailout of fannie and freddies shareholders management and bondholders comrade paulson comrade bernanke and the bolshevik great leader bush but then their whole approach and ideology has always been not one of free market capitalism but rather one of privatizing gains and socializing the losses or socialism for wall street the rich and the well connected so they will now get what they deserve and worked so hard to achieve a nationalization and bailout of the u s financial system

1075965 i have found it amazing is that american registrars are extremely tolerant of fraudulent domains and most unhelpful much more so than their counterparts in other countries despite reports of fraud and fake whois most registrars do not even bother replying those that do

1075975 like taking candy from a baby how young children interact with online environments
1075976 if you cancel your membership then your belongings will go into storage and will be automatically retrieved when you re subscribe
1075977 theres no doubt young children love to go online and we observed examples of wholesome good quality web delivered content
1075978 but after watching ten hours of typical online play we were shocked at the extent of manipulative behavior
1075979 theres nothing more painful than watching a young child cry
1075980 but unfortunately thats the end result for too many children who are spending time with state of the art childrens online content
1075981 if something looks too good to be true it probably is
1075982 we believe parents need a more complete picture of the web sites where their young children are spending an increasing amount of time
1075983 one test family spent 1 316 in a year on stuffed animals on a single site some sites play for profit on a childs emotions to the degree we saw begging tantrums and even tears in the videos

1075985 as part of that series i met peter jones the london spank daddy i wanted him to write a story for one of my books called spank me
1075986 it struck me his own story was fascinating and worth breaking away from the normal form of erotic short stories
1075987 it has opened my eyes to the fact people are so much more accepting of peoples sexuality every high street has a shop selling vibrators whereas five or six years ago nothing was as honest and open as it is now
1075988 he agreed to the book because he wanted people to understand that for a fairly large percentage of the population this is something inherent in them not a freak or kink its not necessarily sexual some people find they need to be spanked for discipline reasons as well as erotic
1075989 the spanking community are terrified as gays were 20 or 30 years ago of being outed but this will help make it more mainstream even though it is something done in private
1075990 there are various spanking sites and party groups on the internet an awful lot of spank doctors clients are very powerful executive women who spend the whole day being in charge its a total release for them having the power turned on them
1075991 i was intrigued as to why women would want such a thing sometimes its the discipline and their husbands or partners wouldnt hurt them enough and thats when theres no sex involved
1075992 what is really interesting is that women go to an older man a smartly dressed authoritative head master type
1075993 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
1075994 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
1075995 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
1075996 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
1075997 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth
1075998 dont be afraid of your material or your past be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you be afraid of not getting your writing done
1075999 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
1076000 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
1076001 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
1076002 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative
1076003 danger stalks two people in the jungles of san torisco in alison kents latest release the perfect stranger likeable characters intense emotion high risk factor and some spicy sex are what ms kent has cooked up for her readers
1076004 everybody probably uses the cheap plastic cartridge cases the only problem i have with them is the lid is always in the way and sometimes when trying to open the lid farther the cartridge box tips and you can dump out the cases i did some cogitating and came up with these 061 music wire clips they work great and the unexpected benefit is that the cases are more stable while sitting at the bench the round wire is ideal because it still allows a cartridge to fit in the hole where the clip is placed now all i need to do is make another 15 or 20 so i can have one in every case i own
1076005 just so everybody knows that when it is noon in the united states the sun is setting over france

1076050 i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1076051 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
1076052 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
1076053 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
1076054 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
1076055 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
1076056 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
1076057 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
1076058 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
1076059 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
1076060 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
1076061 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
1076062 in the guise of questioning the denominations churches of christianity and saying
1076063 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is flawless
1076064 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me if you really knew me you would know my father as well from now on you do know him and have seen him
1076065 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven

1076076 oh gawd look at what things have been reduced to
1076077 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1076078 none of what they do is going to stop us from delivering our message
1076079 there is evidence that hatred of our religion was the motivation in part at least
1076080 i am deeply honored to be recognized by equal justice works

1076085 we informed the defence and the court this morning the next hearing has been set for september when this will be discussed
1076086 excuse me but can you tell me approximately how far it is from here to knoxville
1076087 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1076088 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1076089 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
1076090 privatisation is in the national partys dna so it is simply not believable for them to say they would not privatise key assets like kiwibank and you could probably add to that kiwirail the share in air new zealand electricity soes and another long list of state assets
1076091 clearly english sees key as the smiling face hes the pretty boy put up front english is the real brains behind it all
1076092 despite what the critics said and that kiwibank was always going to be a bit of a risk it has actually worked
1076093 i think the bank is held in high affection amongst kiwis
1076094 it would probably cost the city council the same amount its contributing now
1076095 die zensur in china ist ein symptom eines berwachungsstaates der von westlichen konzernen seit jahren technisch unterst tzt wird

1076106 they blame the media they blame us they refuse to accept responsibility for anything that is going on in that plant
1076107 we are god fearing people and we believe in the american system and we believe it will ultimately turn out ok

1076109 we werent talking about cursory stuff what kind of clothes to wear we were talking trial strategy
1076110 theres no question that these calls are privileged and we rely on that because the criminal justice system would come to a screeching halt if we had to drive to the jail every time we had to talk to our clients

1076125 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
1076126 we might as well have just got robbed by a bunch of thugs downtown
1076127 this is an action with the federal government which is sad
1076128 because these laws need to be revisited in washington especially the medical marijuana law were incarcerating people by the tens of thousands were destroying peoples lives and people who have a medical marijuana legitimacy are caught in the middle its a problem we need to resolve this conflict is totally unacceptable
1076129 we heard some noise outside and then the door literally burst in and the dea came in in full combat gear told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads

1076165 there are no plans in place from transit or anywhere that there are any thoughts of shifting state highway 87 out of mosgiel
1076166 with wages behaving for now roughly as the rbnz expected we remain of the view that the rbnz will continue to steadily cut the official cash rate ocr by 25 base points at consecutive meetings taking the ocr down to 6 75
1076167 indeed the rbnz is betting on lower demand keeping those pressures in check easing in difficulties in finding labour should also help ease wage inflation pressures over the coming year
1076168 we are expecting high electricity demand monday due to the heat advisory in effect for much of north central and south central texas

1076183 while the past six months have not been a great time to start borrowing we are talking about long term debt not something for the next six months
1076184 nationals infrastructure announcement is gimmicky and insubstantial the reality is all they have done is re announced a plan to subsidise telecoms rollout of fibre to the home a widely panned proposal that has nothing to do with economic growth and promised to spend more on roads without naming any actual new roading projects
1076185 in early budgets dr cullen declared that anything under 30 of gdp was a prudent level of debt
1076186 by that standard nationals plan to see gross debt average at around 22 of gdp over the next 10 years is ultra prudent

1076222 im sorry rose its a perfectly normal biological process for me i just forget sometimes how it looks to other people you werent prepared and thats my fault i knew it could happen again while you were traveling with me but i never told you about it for much the same reasons that humans usually dont talk about their own deaths i suppose
1076223 that me the one you first met that was my ninth incarnation this is my tenth
1076224 some time lords used to be able to control how they looked but that was usually when they were safe at home on gallifrey and had time to concentrate and direct the energy
1076225 so this thing you do this regeneration you said it was to save your own life
1076226 normally its meant for when the body just naturally wears out you regenerate and it simply resets to a younger state when its used to heal yourself after some sort of catastrophic damage though it becomes random basically you take what you get

1076252 high end companies like cristal and petron liquor and louis vuitton want to be the gatekeepers of their celebrity affiliations
1076253 thats a good question but what can we do we cant forbid people from buying it im sure dom perignon or krug would be delighted to have their business
1076254 the cristal incident was another example of a luxury brand not appreciating the very segment that was largely responsible for the visibility and support of their brand
1076255 now you dont see cristal the way you used to
1076256 the brands dont say it but where they spend their marketing dollars is very reflective of who they want wearing their things
1076257 they will launch the legal machine just to make headaches because they dont want to be associated with britney spears who shaves her head and has a teen sister who has a baby
1076258 while they cant say that britneys family isnt allowed to buy their products theyre not happy with the association so they do try to stop it
1076259 take a crayon and draw all over the brands clear image
1076260 celebrities have a giant influence just by picking up a particular brand
1076261 but they can conversely destroy it if they think the brand is manhandling them or just being rude
1076262 luxury brands can control what happens in their actual marketing because theyll pay for celebrities to appear but what happens organically they cant really control even though theyd like to

1076468 this nation is more than the sum of its parts that out of many we are truly one
1076469 our communal values our sense of mutual responsibility and social solidarity
1076470 the compelling idea that theres serious evil in the world and hardship and pain and we should be humble and modest in our belief we can eliminate those things but we shouldnt use that as an excuse for cynicism and inaction i take away the sense we have to make these efforts knowing they are hard and not swinging from na ve idealism to bitter realism

1076472 the nypds growing obsession with secrecy is unacceptable and incompatible with open government
1076473 safe streets require mutual trust between the police and the community yet the nypd insists on hiding the most basic and important information from the public the role of race in police shootings is a source of deep concern and outrage for many new yorkers hiding this information doesnt make this concern go away it just further frays new yorks ability to trust its police department
1076474 the nypd cannot shroud its shooting practices in a veil of secrecy
1076475 if the police department will not voluntarily release the information needed to independently study the role of race in police shootings we are confident that the courts will require it do so

1076485 es imperdonable que autov as que se est n inaugurando hoy no est n preparadas al 100 con todas las medidas de seguridad que eviten accidentes y nefastas p rdidas de conductores especialmente motoristas ya que los guardarrailes utilizados siguen siendo el verdugo de los motoristas
1076486 somos el ltimo lugar de europa donde est llegando la autov a nos llega a trozos mal y encima con una tremenda carencia de elementos de seguridad que ya se ha comprobado que son imprescindibles como el caso de guardarrailes que en lugar de matar o amputar a los motoristas consigan evitar estas muertes innecesarias pero al parecer no trae cuenta invertir en seguridad en la autov a de motril
1076487 no es admisible bajo ning n t rmino menos a n el econ mico que una autov a que se pone en servicio ahora no est perfectamente acondicionada con las ltimas medidas de seguridad sobre todo en aquellos mbitos de sobra conocidos por el ministerio que indican que el uso de guardarrailes en h y no protegidos son la principal causa de muerte y amputaci n en los motoristas
1076488 queremos que nuestra autov a sea conocida por la m s segura de espa a y que quienes vengan a torrenueva o a cualquier municipio de la costa tropical sepan que est n circulando por una autov a que cuida de los motoristas para eso hemos estado esperando veinte a os ahora queremos la mejor y m s segura autov a de espa a y lucharemos por ella
1076489 within the next two weeks google is expected to announce advanced software and services that would allow handset makers to bring
1076490 the next season is anne of cleves and jane seymour
1076491 i think youve created a king that i would not want to mess with
1076492 natalie was upset and stunned during the first series when a few particularly american journalists said shes just a bit of fluff they thought she was just manipulative cold and heartless and said we want to see the end of this bitch natalie said that her reading of anne was that she was a very intelligent woman who had a very profound effect on the future of england not only giving birth to elizabeth but in person and i said i totally agree natalie said i just want to prove them wrong can you throw everything at me so in the second series i very very consciously threw everything at her and she responded incredibly that last episode i think if you had any lingering feelings against her theyre completely washed away by the manner of her death and you feel extraordinary sympathy with her and her courage is fantastic it was a great performance
1076493 i think that anne s a conduit she allows women to understand now that queen is a bad job katherine of aragon maria doyle kennedy that was a wonderful performance too was born to rule so thats a different deal anne had to learn on the job there are parallels too between anne boleyn and diana princess of wales there are deliberate connections in fact diana had said there cant be three people in a marriage and anne boleyn uses the same words
1076494 he did believe in the divine right of kings and he did have absolute power and like everyone else who gained absolute power it turned him mad by the end of his reign hes a psychopath nobody is safe in his court it was much better to be dead than to be around henry and the tragedy was he set off so idealistically and optimistically he was a great guy when he was young and he let it all go and it was a tragedy for the country
1076495 what i would like to do is go back to henry vii henry viiis father and show how the dynasty was set up because thats interesting and then id kind of like to jump forward to his son edward vi with seymour as lord protector and then queen mary who tried to reintroduce catholicism mary married the king of spain and then thought she was pregnant but it was a tumor and she nearly killed her own sister elizabeth thats an amazing period
1076496 when i read the script i had no idea who george hogg even was
1076497 but a lot of people dont know he never really got the opportunity to be well known
1076498 george hogg went to china to tell a story to become a robert capa like figure
1076499 hogg was a boy who went to oxford and arrived in china to find that it was different from anything hed ever experienced he found that life was waiting there for him it gave him all the things he hadnt anticipated
1076500 it was just something i wanted to have a go at
1076501 i dont have to make it any more complex than that when i first started i wanted a job over a period of years i started to look at it differently now its less about the money and more about the work itself its a learning process you cant learn to be a painter without painting and you cant learn to be an actor without acting
1076502 it was very funny to wake up and go work with a crew of elvis loving americans with me being this irish lad from cork it was kind of freaky
1076503 i thought it was possible that i was giving the worst performance in history
1076504 its not like i ever felt dude i was so on it today
1076505 the tudors is now a fixture for us at showtime and were on our way to completing the entire saga of all six wives of henry viii
1076506 we are enormously proud of this show the extraordinary cast and the production team that recreates the grandeur of the renaissance year in and year out there is nothing like this anywhere on american television
1076507 i always think of henry viii as tony soprano in the sopranos
1076508 he was one of the most primal characters in history but he
1076509 if we had gone back and done the fat henry viii people would have said we have seen it a million times there would have been no reason to tell that story again
1076510 henry was a man who could do anything and f anyone the fact is his d k changed the course of history literally
1076511 we are being truthful to the period while at the same time telling the story through a soapy passionate violent and contemporary filter its more like baz luhrmanns romeo juliet than the kind of masterpiece theatre people are used to
1076512 it amuses me that the best british drama for 15 years is actually coming out of america
1076513 there is evidence to say he was athletic and magnetic in his younger days
1076514 but there is no actual evidence that he had a great number of mistresses for the first 10 years henry was very close to his first wife catherine of aragon they formed a very good partnership
1076515 it is important to remember he married very early and there is evidence of only one mistress but one or more mistresses was fairly tame by the standards of the period
1076516 to portray him as someone whose sexual urges are driving the history of england is problematic it suggests he has no other policies or political ambitions
1076517 oh i know it people always say to me youre so jittery you cant sit still youre nervous but im not nervous im just a very excitable guy im enthusiastic i cant help myself
1076518 i had a great time on that and when tom and i were together it was like whoosh all the air in the room evaporated he was terrific to work with because he is so committed and professional i mean 17 hours a day you have to respect that
1076519 great film great performance but what a sociopath your character is
1076520 hes not a sociopath hes just a guy in a bad spot
1076521 neither hes a megalomaniac somebody with absolute power who has been corrupted by it absolutely he was a great king in many ways and did great things but he also did terrible things not just to his women but to his people in the matter of divorcing catherine of aragon and marrying anne boleyn challenging the church he gave his people no choice choose the pope or the king be excommunicated by the pope or excommunicated by the king and god help you if you choose the pope im trying to show how he became what he became why he was so paranoid why he was so ashamed he was paranoid because everybody wanted to be king and the knives were everywhere literally he was ashamed because in the matter of catherine and anne he knew hed done wrong he never doubted the legitimacy of his marriage to catherine he wanted anne period
1076522 i had some trepidation when offered the role you know when i played elvis i could look in the mirror and sort of see elvis in myself but henry the viii so you know i decided id play it more from here
1076523 fuck he doesnt look that dissimilar from me i worried a little how id stack up hes so tall hes got that overpowering quality and ive met him he handed me my golden globe for elvis
1076524 i hope season three focuses on the rebellion in scotland where you see henry fight for a change
1076525 absolutely deserved to be beheaded anne boleyn was executed because there was no other way to get out of that she couldnt give him a son and that was the reason for the marriage but katherine howard earned her beheading she was a little nymphomaniac she had over one hundred lovers in the palace
1076526 well she was very young and silly the poor thing had no concept of wed and bed she didnt see she was doing anything wrong henry being rather gross by then
1076527 season two belongs to her she owns it she plays it like a harp and broke down walls with this performance
1076528 its cracking good drama but as a historian my hairs standing on end
1076529 i think its misplaced to be honest its sloppy filmmaking historically forget it this is not what happened
1076530 for a program to be made with integrity it has to take account of the facts
1076531 not one female costume in there is correct for the period its so off the mark its laughable theyre like fairy tale costumes
1076532 but jonathan rhys meyers shouldve been made to look like henry viii he needed a wig they shouldve aged him he shouldve put on a bit of weight its such a missed opportunity they have all the resources why get some things right and not others
1076533 its a silly criticism its not supposed to be history its a drama a soap opera thats based on historical material
1076534 as long as people arent wearing jeans or caftans to me thats acceptable
1076535 americans have a pretty big resistance to watching men in tights so one of the things i was commissioned to do was to make history relevant
1076536 instead of writing something where the characters seemed like people from another planet i wanted to do something that resonated with contemporary audiences i didnt want these people to seem remote in any way
1076537 the basis of the first season was a young guy whos married to an older woman meets a younger woman and then wants a divorce thats a universal story
1076538 you look at the whole royal court theyre basically models and the costumes and the sets are gorgeous its so colorful and elegant and dripping with luxury they make it so rich
1076539 you cant go oh my god he wouldnt really leave his wife for her
1076540 you cant look at it the same way as the hills
1076541 it may be dry in a history book but if you think about it it involves peoples beliefs and passions and their whole way of life being destroyed and challenged
1076542 and people will become very wealthy and very powerful and other people will be destroyed
1076543 henrys only a king because he was anointed such but you have go right through the crown go right through the jewelry go right through the clothes go right through the doors of the apartment go right through into the naked human and you realize how vulnerable he actually is
1076544 youve got to learn to allow the clothes to wear you as well as you wearing the clothes and you have to walk differently you stand differently
1076545 i just turned 30 and it does inform the way i play henry who is much more mature and less erratic ive changed over the past year
1076546 in the last season henry was a young boy who falls in love for the first time and dabbles in poli tics we left things on the edge of the abyss
1076547 season 2 jumps into it with the reformation the most impor tant single decade in english history
1076548 he also thought it might be a good idea to remove anne boleyn if she caused trouble
1076549 i have to be honest i hadnt heard of the tudors when i was sent the script
1076550 but i was amused by it and so here i am im very much enjoying playing the pope not least im enjoying the fact that people bow and kiss my ring
1076551 when you shoot such a lengthy series relationships become established and theres genuine respect and tenderness between actors that is not dis similar to a married couple
1076552 there is a natural chemistry between jonathan and me and jonathan is a true gentleman
1076553 she be comes a wife and a mother and she goes from having been the other woman to finding herself at the other point of the triangle
1076554 there are not a whole lot of belly laughs in this series
1076555 henry was a young virile man who was having a lot of fun but he didnt really seem that serious
1076556 when you see henry in season 2 hes a little less foolish
1076557 the mistakes he makes are harder and they have more consequences but hes more powerful hes starting to realize his own strength he doesnt have to answer to anybody including god he realizes its all his
1076558 he loses his conscience and it marks the beginning of a slide into tyranny into the monster he becomes
1076559 what henry did and its very evident in season 2 is he didnt give anybody a real choice you have to choose him or the pope if you choose the pope god help you if you choose him you face excommunication from your religion
1076560 id be a terrible comedian i cant be funny on cue and i dont think i could do take 10 of a joke
1076561 nobody wants to watch a 300 pound red haired guy running around screaming its just not attractive after five or six episodes people are going to turn it off would you like to see henry as is having sex probably not its poetic license
1076562 when i played elvis i could look in the mirror in the morning and see elvis it was very easy to do that with hair and makeup its difficult for me to look in the mirror and see henry ive got to be 6 foot 5 in here
1076563 so thats very challenging but why else would i do it
1076564 oh i know it people always say to me youre so jittery you cant sit still youre nervous but im not nervous im just a very excitable guy im enthusiastic i cant help myself
1076565 i had a great time on that and when tom and i were together it was like whoosh all the air in the room evaporated
1076566 great film great performance but what a sociopath your character is
1076567 hes not a sociopath hes just a guy in a bad spot
1076568 neither hes a megalomaniac somebody with absolute power who has been corrupted by it absolutely
1076569 he was a great king in many ways and did great things but he also did terrible things not just to his women but to his people in the matter of divorcing catherine of aragon and marrying anne boleyn challenging the church he gave his people no choice choose the pope or the king be excommunicated by the pope or excommunicated by the king and god help you if you choose the pope
1076570 im trying to show how he became what he became why he was so paranoid why he was so ashamed he was paranoid because everybody wanted to be king and the knives were everywhere literally he was ashamed because in the matter of catherine and anne he knew hed done wrong he never doubted the legitimacy of his marriage to catherine he wanted anne period
1076571 i hope season 3 focuses on the rebellion in scotland where you see henry fight for a change
1076572 i base a lot of what i do with henry on
1076573 we must never let the lion know his own strength god help us if we do
1076574 it brings some very real and new challenges i had to find a way of reinventing henry that made him seem older more cynical and controlled his temper gets much worse this season and he gets more vicious hes going down that long and dangerous road to loneliness and paranoia
1076575 its one of the great drama of all time the blood alone is amazing i think henry was responsible for the deaths of over 70 000 people imagine he went from this golden figure which he was as a young man to an utterly decadent and corrupted human being
1076576 hes not too keen on women i dont think hes too keen on very much
1076577 he kicks off his red socks and settles down with a nice brandy and a porn film
1076578 the tudors the series which critics could take or leave but many viewers are eating up the costumes the sets the sex scenes returns for its second season on sunday march 30
1076579 i have got absolutely no physical attributes in common with henry viii
1076580 so everything has to be more about his energy more about power more about confidence
1076581 you dont want to see a skinny guy in a big fat suit
1076582 showtime commissioned me to write an entertainment a soap opera and not history
1076583 i didnt want two princess marys on the call sheet
1076584 which one do you mean michael who do we dress
1076585 he was going to come back to a show trial
1076586 and the best that he could get would have been a public beheading in front of all his enemies and a jubilant crowd
1076587 i didnt want him to go out with a whimper i wanted him to go out with a bang
1076588 i mean who is henry but a man whos married to an older woman who falls in love with a younger one and wants to marry her
1076589 he had such an emotional response to the idea of playing a father
1076590 its an eternity ring its got a little message to me a secret message
1076591 its just something that two people in a relationship give to each other
1076592 everybody keeps asking me if im married its nice to keep them guessing
1076593 anne going to die and this horrible place and everything that is dark about the human spirit and what man can do to one another
1076594 so it was almost as though i needed to go through the whole upset process before i could stoically find my composure to walk up on to the scaffold
1076595 the second series is darker its more serious there are big issues and of course the big issue is the reformation
1076596 some of the things in the first series that people might have found too skittish a band of young bloods having lots of sex and going hunting having a rather carefree life while cardinal wolsey ran the state thats gone
1076597 hes not ginger hes not tall and rotund but the kind of alpha male that henry was at his root that he has a charismatic young man who had the eye of lots of ladies
1076598 henry was someone who never recognized boundaries nobody could tell him he couldnt do something
1076599 to do a citizen kane and get big bald ferocious ugly monstrous
1076600 natalie said just throw everything at me and i did i put her through the wringer
1076601 i was incredibly nervous about the psychological depths that she went to the hysteria the falling foul of herself just the mess
1076602 coming across as weak and thats the last thing that anne was
1076603 you need to have that low in order to see it rise toward the end to go to her death with dignity
1076604 i remember cross country which i enjoyed and history which i enjoyed a lot too i also remember sitting outside eating sandwiches in the winter and complaining about how cold it was
1076605 chiltern edge was always really good at public speaking back in the day we thrashed places like reading blue coat school
1076606 keep going with it because there is a lot in it its something that my employers always picked up on
1076607 its a lot more important than you think it is dont ever underestimate the impression it makes on people being a rounded person and having a lot of interests is just as important as the academic marks
1076608 i was shocked to be invited back to the school because i have just finished shooting the second season of the tudors in ireland and i dont have work at the moment
1076609 im back to walking into rooms trying to impress writers and producers into employing me and i feel im back on the ground and im never going to work again
1076610 every time you have to prove yourself and its easy to get disheartened but to be invited here and be given a point of reference has made me realise how much ive achieved
1076611 in terms of succeeding in your career only part of it is to do with talent its about persistence
1076612 keep knocking on the door and dont take no for an answer eventually someone will open it
1076613 natalie was excellent at languages i think because of her public speaking ability it gave her confidence
1076614 the kids were very motivated by meeting her today because it shows what you can achieve in the next step after school
1076615 id love to lie but you cant these days because of the internet im turning 40 this year a milestone and ive a pinter esque ambivalence about it
1076616 no one in my world had ever done such a thing so it was kind of a fantasy
1076617 drama school in england functions as kind of the first round in american idol if you go youre going to get seen by agents and casting directors
1076618 i spent all my time watching anthony hopkins and seeing if i could copy what he was doing
1076619 you just sort of keep quiet and flit your eyes around a lot then you cross your fingers and hope for the best
1076620 but as far as show creator michael hirst was concerned my character was the lenin of the reformation he wanted to annihilate the catholic church and basically did within five years
1076621 hirst put a lot of sex in it and made it look young and fresh and edgy
1076622 but once people get drawn into the story theyre good to go because the story is fantastic
1076623 it really got me in the mode of thinking like a stage actor where you have to absolutely respect the language
1076624 to get up in front of a camera of course you have to have vanity all acting is narcissism in some way ive always been seen as a pretty boy
1076625 any actor who tells you theyre not vain is bullsh tting
1076626 any actor who believes that their physicality is not an intrinsic part of why they land a role is fooling themselves
1076627 role model so you cant go out and drink two bottles of vodka and get behind the wheel of a porsche because you dont want other people to do that
1076628 im usually on location somewhere so that keeps me safe working keeps you entertained and off the streets
1076629 it was just one of those relationships you have to have hes a very interesting charming soulful person
1076630 i was only 19 and not mature enough im a selfish boyfriend i had a lot of rejection in my childhood and when youre rejected you cant accept love and certainly cant give it
1076631 youre in a job where people you dont know will judge your work publicly that creates insecurity i dont think theres an actor out there whos not insecure in some way and if they tell you theyre not theyre lying
1076632 i dont think im rebellious i think i just didnt suit school
1076633 yes life was difficult i didnt have both parents we didnt have money and my mother was not a very responsible woman but thats not uncommon in this world i did not grow up in an orphanage as people have written but yes i was discovered in a pool hall
1076634 i was 16 and i made 500 au 1000 for two hours work
1076635 but then i went on the set of michael collins which was the second film i shot and it wasnt even the acting it was just the whole atmosphere the whole buzz about it the big cameras and suddenly it was kind of like this is a pretty f cking cool job
1076636 for every film ive landed ive been turned down for hundreds of others
1076637 suddenly im in the best woody allen movie in 10 years in a big role but it was difficult because i was playing somebody who is weak
1076638 its a lot of fun being king thats where the party is
1076639 people have said henry viii didnt look like me fair enough but no critic can tell me that how i play henry isnt right because i play him a hell of a lot closer to history than people admit he was an egotistical spoilt brat born with the arrogance that everything he had in this world was his by right
1076640 i get to be a musician and its a big commercial film that shows a lighter side to me
1076641 i learnt the guitar and sang all the songs myself and i was able to play somebody who was compassionate and who was looking for that first rush
1076642 theres always that girl or that guy you didnt spend enough time with
1076643 maybe youre sitting in a cafe and you see this beautiful girl or this beautiful guy and you never see them again but they stay with you i completely believe in love at first sight
1076644 i have a house in the hills i go to the gym i go to restaurants m y life hasnt changed its a job some people deem as glamorous and i admit there are certain amounts of glamour in that life but theres an awful lot of an actors life that isnt glamorous i get up at 5 30am and spend most of my time in caravans in obscure locations shooting 12 hours a day its much harder than people realise i dont see myself as a big moviestar at all
1076645 there are certain things you can get away with when youre anonymous that you cant get away with when you are not you have to be more cautious

1076658 as barack obama is globe trotting across europe voters back in berlin paris and london usa want to know why he voted against funding our military and refuses to admit that he was wrong on the troop surge
1076659 when our military needed necessary resources barack obama failed to stand up
1076660 a veteran and someone who has always put the public interest first
1076661 if obama cant rise above politics to support our soldiers in a time of war then how can he claim to have the strength to change the way washington works
1076662 there are honest differences between senator obamas position on iraq and senator mccains
1076663 given that the youth vote has been increasingly engaged in the election this year and has played a growing role
1076664 we want to go after people who are in the political middle and are not fully committed on this race
1076665 i think that the campaigns are smart to pay special attention to reaching out to young people
1076666 from the very beginning i told them this is a principled guy so when you said you were going to help me drive affordably again i believed you
1076667 thats not a solution mr mccain thats a gimmick we expected better
1076668 builds on this theme we started with the alex commercial a real person talking to the camera about an important issue
1076669 big oil companies are getting billions from the government raking in record profits while we pay more and more for gas
1076670 john mccains answer another 4 billion giveaway to big oil
1076671 his plan would benefit the bottom lines of the oil companies that just made these record and obscene profits
1076672 obama has promised to take on these oil companies his plan would benefit hard working americans
1076673 barack obama and his special interest friends may believe that americans should deal with high gas prices by inflating their tires but americans overwhelmingly agree with john mccains balanced approach
1076674 you know i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice that he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for not just what hes against
1076675 this ad obviously also addresses a unique facet in barack obamas campaign that is unlike any other campaign weve seen in modern political history a campaign that is focused on the development of an enormous image of celebrity status in the early aspects of the ad we have images of other celebrities that demonstrate that the focus of the obama campaign has been as much to create that celebrity status of his as it is to discuss the hard issues that the american public are forced to debate during the course of this campaign
1076676 do the american people want to elect the worlds biggest celebrity or do they want to elect an american hero somebody who is a leader somebody who has the right ideas to deal in a serious way with the problems we face
1076677 is unwilling to let false attacks go unanswered that is the careful balance you need to respond to the mccain campaigns false negative attacks but also make sure you are talking about the issues central to senator obamas candidacy
1076678 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another
1076679 look im not proud of every joke ive ever told
1076680 but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
1076681 al wanted to address it head on and then move on to what this race is really about
1076682 trying to apologize for a 30 year record of this type of humor
1076683 if a man loves his brother he should tell him that he loves him
1076684 freedom means that when the iraqi people and their prime minister ask us to make a plan to leave we do but senator mccain would occupy iraq indefinitely against their wishes
1076685 thats not what freedom means thats not what we fought for
1076686 not about troops and tactics this is about strategy and diplomacy
1076687 obama voted against funding for the very troops this ad claims to represent
1076688 rather than attacking john mccain for listening to general david petraeus this group should ask why obama lacked the strength to stand up for our troops during a time of war
1076689 it implies that mccain in no way cares when troops come home from iraq
1076690 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
1076691 treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into youre less patriotic than me im more patriotic
1076692 that is a completely distorted and i think inappropriate advertisement
1076693 the reality is he found time to go to the gym to drink martinis with reporters in berlin but canceled a visit to wounded troops
1076694 i know of no pentagon regulation that would have prevented him from going there without the media and the press and all of the associated people nothing that i know of would have kept him from visiting those wounded troops
1076695 some people have power and connections but most of us have to make our own way through life
1076696 with churches to help families get job training and after school care for their children
1076697 despite the political pressure obama has stood with us for immigration reform and spoke out for our veterans
1076698 its time we had a president who understands we all deserve a chance to make our own way
1076699 not only has stood with us but he is one of us he knows our experience his values are our values his experiences are our experiences
1076700 will be someone who can relate to our experiences from birth
1076701 i feel so strongly that democrats and republicans have to come together
1076702 for susan collins to assert that she opposes tax breaks for big oil is the height of hypocrisy she voted for the bush cheney energy bill that created the biggest boon to oil companies in american history
1076703 no matter how hard she tries she cannot run away from a record of consistently being there for bush cheney on the big issues at the peril of mainers

1076737 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
1076738 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
1076739 you can love perhaps for a year a month a day even for an hour and in that hour i do believe you love as well and deeply as any man but after that hour you love not you love another and then another you love is most generous where it is most hurtful
1076740 she is just a girl but if she has her way she will set our whole country in a roar
1076741 so you were a f ing virgin thats not the point
1076742 nothing will be the same you and i will be immortal
1076743 nevertheless he asks an important question whether it is better for a king to be feared or loved
1076744 i am thinking i should behave like the king of france
1076745 when satan was thrown from heaven was he ever invited back
1076746 the king is plain in love with you dont you see niece it makes a man very vulnerable anne it would be wise not to be fooled by your own masquerade
1076747 now dont be too modest thomas you are not a saint
1076748 when she opens her legs for him she can open her mouth to denounce wolsey they do say that the sharpest blades are sheathed in the softest pouches
1076749 alright if you want the world to know that the king of england is easily changeable shallow intemperate incapable of keeping his word then of course i will go an tell him after all i am merely his majestys humble servant
1076750 your sister is quite a talented musican herself as well as a very beautiful young woman even though not as beautiful as her brother
1076751 i recognize no queen but my mother but if the kings mistress would intercede with the king on my behalf then i would be grateful
1076752 15 pounds for one stroke dear god he makes a damn good living
1076753 then heres the truth you must shut your eyes and endure like your betters have done before you
1076754 tell him i died his good servant but gods first
1076755 i cant wait to ride some young french stallion while im here
1076756 you and i campeggio have done well to avoid the craft of women celibacy is an immense relief
1076757 perhaps i have never fully explained myself to you your grace i have never been interested in reforming them the priests my real and only interest is in destroying them
1076758 i promise you that i am going to make such a reformation in this kingdom that i shall be remembered eternally throughout all christendom
1076759 well i dont need to push my baby around anymore so ill leave this here for the next needy couple

1076768 you are talking about henry viii 8th arent you you repeatedly refer to his father henry vii 7th get your facts staight
1076769 the six wives of henry vii i dont expect that there will be alot of comments to this thread i just thought that the fans of this series might like seeing her photo
1076770 how old was she at the time then again how old was anne

1076772 armani jeans expresses my vision of a young independent casual lifestyle with a strong and cool fashion sensibility
1076773 solange epitomises this style perfectly and brings to it that swing so evident in her new single i decided
1076774 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1076775 it is an extremely exciting time in our nations history to be in washington i think we have the strongest portfolio of news programs and outlets in america
1076776 from the beginning of my management of starbucks i wanted it to be the employer of choice the company everybody wanted to work for by paying more than the going wage in restaurants and retail stores and by offering benefits that werent available elsewhere i hoped that starbucks would attract people who were well educated and eager to communicate our passion for coffee to my thinking a generous benefits package was a key competitive advantage
1076777 americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today
1076778 and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its got to be fixed
1076779 are paying so much that they are paying into a system that they wont receive benefits from on its present track that its on thats the point
1076780 ive got to say to keep your retirement happy and sunny tell john mccain keep your mitts off my money
1076781 a lot of our members are very supportive of john mccain as a person and they see him as a peer but once our members begin to know how he feels about social security and the fact that hes calling it a disgrace while still taking it it helps them understand that he isnt going to be working in their best interest
1076782 it sounded like this was the first time he was realizing how social security works and so either he doesnt know how it works or he doesnt care
1076783 home schooling as an open learning educational challenge in south africa
1076784 theres nothing you can do because the plates are just screwed on
1076785 our offenders use the registration plates of other vehicles similar to their own and they commit these crimes
1076786 thats the best proactive advice that we can provide but a determined criminal will work extremely hard to get a plate if they want to
1076787 they should not wait until the next day because a crime couldve been committed by then
1076788 gone are the days where you can feel reassured that you can leave your garden shed unlocked and nothing will be taken
1076789 he knew that terror was going to occur before it happened
1076790 hes an al qaeda warrior he has wounded and the people he has worked with have wounded the world
1076791 not good enough to convict someone of some of the most heinous crimes that this country has ever experienced
1076792 but oh my soul dont be discouraged dont be upset expect god to act for i know that i shall again have plenty of reason to praise him for all that he will do he is my help he is my god

1076797 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it
1076798 but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1076799 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality and knox a bit of me
1076800 wow what kind of a loser would have that sort of fine
1076801 i grew up watching lindsay and it made me want to do what she does
1076802 just the whole vibe being there being on camera or onstage with everybody listening to you its so cool when people look up to you
1076803 so bad you dont even know and now its actually happening ive already been asked for my autograph and its just a really good feeling to have
1076804 train wreck seems to be the route to fame in that family
1076805 when you grow up in front of the camera and youre young you just want to please the adults around you that trumps all the natural developmental stages a child should go through
1076806 your sense of self gets fused with the fact that youre playing a role when theres no more role theres no sense of self that can leave you empty unable to self regulate and vulnerable to substance abuse
1076807 lindsays gotten so much attention for the negative that it makes sense that ali might try to do the negative things as well

1076823 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements
1076824 everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1076825 we wasted precious time by cutting rope from the bottom and bringing it up
1076826 if you cant go down you have to climb up
1076827 so in such a difficult situation you are taking more risks youre climbing more technical slopes and finally you make a little mistake and youre gone
1076828 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem
1076829 so actually everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1076830 i didnt have time to start discussion the only thing i had to do was to go down because if you go down you have more oxygen you have more chance to survive

1076833 chilis has 700 possible kids meal combinations but 658 or 94 percent of those are too high in calories including one comprised of country fried chicken crispers cinnamon apples and chocolate milk 1 020 calories and another comprised of cheese pizza home style fries and lemonade 1 000 calories

1076843 deciding to set up our own pr agency was very scary at first however thanks to the continued loyalty of our clients and their trust in us we have all enjoyed great success over the last 12 months along the way through word of mouth and personal recommendation we have also established great relationships with new clients too which is fantastic
1076844 with a background in marketing and having worked in several top name pr agencies i understand the importance of delivering measurable and creative pr campaigns that provide a return on investment these principles have always stood me in great stead which is hopefully evident by the fact that many of the clients i have worked with for several years decided to join us at imagine
1076845 we want to build on the success of the last 12 months by continuing to provide a quality service to our clients and attract new business partners locally and nationally
1076846 then with gods good grace we may not have to meddle with her after all
1076847 i was married before and i rather like the liberty of not being married again
1076848 sometimes my love i think that with you i am already condemned to live in purgatory
1076849 i have decided to carry out the bull of excommunication against king henry a father must always seek for a way to forgive his children but henrys crimes against us and against our faith are too profound to forgive moreover he shows no repentance no contrition
1076850 i ask you only one thing that you allow me to serve and worship you as lancelot served and worshiped guinevere
1076851 are you saying that i should be queen instead of her
1076852 the king has fallen from his horse and has been crushed they say he is likely to die
1076853 i cannot think whether it would be a bad thing or a good thing if he died for as lord protector you would ipso facto be king of england
1076854 she returned the letter unopened and the purse both she said that she had no better treasure in the world than her honor if you want to give her money she prays you might do so when she has made an honorable match
1076855 but i see now that god will not grant me any male children
1076856 its not all my fault you have no one to blame but yourself for this i was distressed to see you with that wench jane seymour
1076857 its true what they have whispered i shut my ears to them but now i know it to be true i made this marriage seduced by witchcraft and for that reason i consider it to be null and void and the evidence is god will not permit us male issue so now i believe with all my heart that i will take another wife
1076858 your reasoning makes sense however i personally dont think henry really believed the adultery charges against anne i know he pretended to believe the charges but deep down inside i think he knew they were false
1076859 notes for a debate on constituent power and constituted power
1076860 what do we all want we want to be all we can be and not just us we also want our family and loved ones to be able to develop their full potential we want all of us to receive what is necessary for our development each according to their need for self development
1076861 if we believe in people if we believe that the goal of human society should be to ensure full human development our choice is clear socialism or barbarism
1076862 oh i was buying that stuff for some french people
1076863 its kind of weird that happened ages ago the fact that its still getting attention its kind of weird theres no feud so for us we just kind of laugh about it cause theres nothing there

1076919 gold is likely to regain 1 000 oz to work higher through 2009 2010
1076920 longer term we believe that gold is capable of doubling or tripling from current levels
1076921 we remain positive on demand fac to rs the forces that have propelled are firmly in place
1076922 following a series of downside fundamental tests gold appears to have found a floor and quietly climbed back to 917 oz
1076923 despite extensive hand wringing the floor in the dollar has inflicted minimal damage
1076924 should inflation accelerate while interest rates are locked under economic weakness gold could spike near past inflation adjusted highs
1076925 we view this as an extremely hospitable macro environment and believe the ongoing investment driven demand phase will continue for gold particularly as the broader inves to r base is not yet fully involved
1076926 gold is coming in to its own with discourse dominated by credit crisis derivatives dislocations currencies inflation and self reinforcing financial negatives we believe endly macroeconomic terri to ry
1076927 investment dominates demand with western macro driven investment demand taking prices higher and eastern jewelry fabrication filling in during periodic pullbacks
1076928 we believe gold has entered a new investment driven phase amid a much more hospitable macro environment while have been rising since 2002 this was largely due to the pull from pro cyclical basic materials and oil in a benign if unbalanced macro environment
1076929 we remain positive on gold based on a mix of macro and supply demand drivers the forces that have propelled years are in place and intensifying
1076930 appreciation remains muted relative prices barely regaining long term constant dollar averages corrections are expected along the way and buying on weakness is recomm to be the central lesson of the past five years
1076931 within the pulse of investment demand catalysts for the gold market rally have shifted from safe haven demand during the early stages of the credit crisis in august september 2007 to currencies as the us dollar plummeted to the broader reflation trade on display in oil
1076932 with equity and fixed income markets facing stiff headwinds we expect weightings toward gold to increase especially as it has been rising in multiple currencies
1076933 this could be amplified by petro dollar flows and sovereign investment funds we continue as a small market with motivated buyers india china russia petro players and few sellers of size
1076934 the key variables will be the extent to which jewelry demand slips and the amount of new scrap becomes available
1076935 the last major price push was the 2006 gain 36 that cut jewelry demand by 16 and inspired 25 more scrap supply we believe a similar pattern is likely in 2008 although more muted due to dollar depreciation and less available scrap
1076936 we believe the likelihood of imf sales are low we regard central bank sales as a normal recurring feature of the gold market that has faded from relevance as a price determinant
1076937 we expect the de hedging to continue particularly from the two major companies that hold over half the remaining contracts

1077069 although the gold price may fluctuate over the very long run gold has consistently reverted to its historic purchasing power parity against other commodities and intermediate products historically gold has proved to be an effective preserver of wealth it has also proved to be a safe haven in times of economic and social instability in a period of a long bull run in equities with low inflation and relative stability in foreign exchange markets it is tempting for investors to expect continual high rates of return on investments it sometimes takes a period of falling stock prices and market turmoil to focus the mind on the fact that it may be important to invest part of ones portfolio in an asset that will at least hold its value

1077075 the singular feature of the great crash of 1929 was that the worst continued to worsen what looked one day like the end proved on the next day to have been only the beginning nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering and also to ensure that as few as possible escaped the common misfortune the fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one and if he met that there would still be another in the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost the man with the smart money who was safely out of the market when the first crash came naturally went back in to pick up bargains not only were a recorded 12 894 650 shares sold on 24 october precisely the same number were bought the bargains then suffered a ruinous fall even the man who waited out all of october and all of november who saw the volume of trading return to normal and saw wall street become as placid as a produce market and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next twenty four months the coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon the ruthlessness of its liquidation was in its own way equally remarkable

1077203 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month

1077389 so if at one point in the history of kkkanada the right of native people to dress and adorn themselves with feathers was legislated away what does it mean when a bunch of darkies promoted to lower level settler status play instruments and revel in streets paved over land drenched with blood making pappy show dancing and amusing themselves with liquor used to poison and addict native people for that matter used to poison and addict these same africans on the islands where they were left to rot after emancipation a rum shop filled with black men on every corner and rich food entertaining white people with memories of recent tourist jaunts are offered the right to adorn themselves with feathers

1077428 because identity theft schemes are much more sophisticated and cunning in todays digital era our bill also expands the scope of the federal identity theft statutes so that the law keeps up with the ingenuity of todays identity thieves
1077429 our bill strengthens the protections for american businesses which are more and more becoming the focus of identity thieves by adding two new causes of action under the cyber extortion statute threatening to obtain or release information from a protected computer and demanding money in relation to a protected computer so that this bad conduct can be federally prosecuted

1077438 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed

1077447 no one in his organization even knew how to make dry anthrax scientists there made wet anthrax which is far easier to make it is used in developing vaccines and testing their effectiveness
1077448 only one paper at the workshop reported near perfect results 100 percent protection from the ames strain with just one or two shots as an old marine corps expression goes this particular paper shined like a diamond inside a goats ass
1077449 why would active duty reserve and national guard personnel jeopardize their military careers and even their liberty rather than take the vaccine the missing element of the mandatory anthrax vaccine program is trust radiation testing agent orange the reckless use of experimental drugs and mysterious gulf war illness have made military men and women understandably distrustful of the pentagon on medical matters

1077451 federal investigators have focused their attention on about four suspects at an army research facility in the terrifying 2001 anthrax letter attacks that showed up in the offices of two senators and several newsrooms including the post
1077452 the suspects include three scientists a former deputy commander a leading anthrax specialist and a microbiologist emphasis added at the bioweapons research facility at fort detrick in maryland sources told fox news
1077453 i am now more convinced than ever that there were individuals inside the bush administration and in the government that wanted the war in iraq so badly that they decided if there was something they could use to push it forward they would anthrax fell into their lap even if he is the deranged solo killer they used him in order to scare this country and say iraq is something we have to go after and we did
1077454 in that case there would be no reason to go after the deranged solo killer
1077455 deliberately skewed to support the notion that there was a north vietnamese attack
1077456 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
1077457 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
1077458 abc news claim which they said came at first from three well placed but separate sources followed by four well placed and separate sources was completely false from the beginning
1077459 initial tests on the anthrax by the us army at fort detrick maryland have detected trace amounts of the chemical additives bentonite and silica
1077460 early in the case us authorities dismissed the possibility that iraq could have sponsored the attacks because investigators determined that the spores had been coated with silica to make them disperse quickly rather than the mineral bentonite regarded by the us army medical research and materiel command as iraqs additive of choice
1077461 however iraqs alleged preference for bentonite appears to be based on a single sample of a common pesticide collected by u
1077462 in 1998 iraq reported to the united nations that it had conducted an artillery test of a live biological agent that used silica as a dispersant
1077463 bush administration officials have acknowledged that the anthrax attacks were an important motivator in the us decision to confront iraq
1077464 professor matthew meselson of harvard and former bioweaponeer ken alibek have both seen large clear electron micrographs of the daschle anthrax they have reported that
1077465 there is virtually no way an experienced scientist can make a mistake and not notice coatings of fumed silica or a silica coating or glass particles or anything like that on a micrograph particularly if they were specifically
1077466 the matsumoto article simply ignores or discounts the alternative explanations and says that the spores were
1077467 why is this important because if the spores were coated that would indicate a large state sponsored manufacturing facility probably made them

1077470 congress has lost some of the shock induced unity with which it first responded to the 9 11 attacks
1077471 but i dont think its somebody insane and i think there are people within our government certainly from the source of it who know where it came from and these people may not have had anything to do with it but they certainly know where it came from

1077499 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
1077500 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
1077501 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
1077502 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back

1077507 theres a lot of things that i pointed out in my state of the state address that havent passed unfortunately i cant think of one that has
1077508 its important this year to factor in a shortened order curve and consider moving up marketing campaigns to october for an early season push
1077509 it pays to start early so youre not competing with as many companies over a short period of time
1077510 honestly you have to look at incremental costs of mailing 50 000 vs 100 000 vs 150 000 catalogs
1077511 how many orders do i have to get to break even in some cases you may improve your deliverability but its hard to monitor that unless your printer is doing follow ups
1077512 lets say you have nine of your best buyers in a zip code maybe that tenth one is worth it

1077514 the controls are great and very easy to use to play you shake the iphone up down and side to side as the dice move around the screen the game makes use of a physics engine so the dice react as they would in real life when they collide with each other and the sides of the iphone as the dice roll the iphone vibrates as well for more feedback
1077515 anyone who has endured a high stakes political race knows that campaigning requires a willingness to suffer a seemingly endless series of small humiliations all that begging for campaign contributions posing for photo ops and talking about me me me as the press corps yawns
1077516 when you are the political spouse who is still usually a wife you also can feel reduced to a life of serial irrelevance
1077517 the way i see it there are a lot of people like me like how i am about my husband my candidate they invested their hearts and souls into hillary clinton and many of them did this for years they have to figure out how they want to leverage their political power i understand that politics is a patience game you cant do this unless you have patience
1077518 i need stability and evenness and not paying attention to media coverage helps its usually either really really good or really really bad which doesnt reflect what people are thinking
1077519 my first reaction to that was oh my goodness this is awful fortunately our girls are young enough where they dont read the new yorker
1077520 they do pick up on things malia asked barack a question about my patriotism i was in another room but i heard her ask him some people are saying mommy doesnt like her country whats that about
1077521 my view as a mom is there isnt a right moment for this kind of thing when it comes up is when we talk about it
1077522 no indications at all this would be the type of person that would engage in such activity article in
1077523 if you want me to kill somebody for you i will
1077524 if them niggahs didnt have the words nigger and fuck theyd be a bunch of goddamn mutes
1077525 why do they keep saying that terrible word that were not allowed to say
1077526 civil rights leader says the n word how could he of all people oh the hypocricy
1077527 sometimes wed make fires and drink beers and pass guitars around
1077528 it was a little frightening at first because mike mogis is such a safety net sonically and someone i rely on but it was also kind of nice to be the one to say when we should move on i have a much more laidback approach to the recording process than mike does for better or for worse i think that comes across on the new record just because im much more about the performance and just getting it to feel right i dont always care if the sounds arent as good as they could be
1077529 i just wanted to try something new im very fortunate in my career where im not on a contract with anyone ive always liked merge and it seemed interesting to have a totally fresh group of people working on it i guess i consider this whole record somewhat of an experiment why not keep it going
1077530 i wouldnt say it was a nightmare but it was difficult just getting all the stuff through customs we had to deliver everything to the place on the back of this rickety pickup truck up these crazy sort of sidewalks roads it was pretty crazy watching it come over the hill wobbling around and you couldnt just run and get something if you needed it whether thats a person or a piece of equipment we had the tape machine break once and my manager literally had to get on a plane in new york and fly us the piece down because it was just going to take too long to ship it and get it through customs
1077531 waking up in the mornings i had a porch off the front of my room with a hammock and a fireplace on there and id go out there and lay and watch the sun come up i dont know what kind of minerals or whatever are in the rocks but they were these crazy pinks and purples and when the sun rises and hits the rocks its breathtaking
1077532 well we drank a lot of micheladas which is kind of a bloody mary made with beer those are pretty delicious if for some reason you find yourself having to drink before like noon
1077533 we went to a temazcal which is kind of like a sweat lodge its like a little igloo we must have had 10 people in there and then a shaman comes and does all these rituals inside the temazcal they shove hot rocks into the center fire pit and you basically just sweat for an hour straight you kind of get out of your mind really fast because youre cleansing your body so rapidly i felt sick for a couple of days afterward but then i felt great man i had a lot of wild thoughts the shaman put a lot of different herbs and different concoctions of liquid on the hot rocks i dont think any of them were necessarily drugs but youre breathing that in and youre sweating and its a pretty intense experience
1077534 everyone we talked to from mexico city asked us if wed seen any omnis which is what they call the spaceships i was looking all the time but i didnt actually see one unfortunately
1077535 i cant say enough nice things about all the people that i met down there theres just a real generosity and kindness with most of the mexican people that ive met its kind of ironic when you think about how a lot of people treat mexican immigrants in the u s it just makes me really sad that thats the kind of welcome that they get up here when they come just to work i did a very similar thing and i was treated with so much kindness its unfortunate

1077608 it was the late 70s or early 80s when i first read solzhenitsyn and for the first time in my life i realized something was wrong about our life our country there were many people like me for whom he was sort of a guide

1077659 interferes with the issue which is who should be elected in november
1077660 now i will be glad as soon as this election is over in january to have this conversation with you and everybody else i have very strong feelings about it
1077661 ive heard it from the press and i will not comment on it there are things i wished i said
1077662 things i wished i hadnt said but i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally
1077663 a different standard was applied to the finest candidate i ever supported
1077664 he hit her hard a couple times and they hit us a few weeks before she ever responded in kind
1077665 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1077666 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some used to someone else being in charge
1077667 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday sunday to realise it is an encompassing job
1077668 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1077669 kp pietersen is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1077670 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1077671 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1077672 working with ian mcgeechan and shaun edwards and all of the coaching staff at wasps has been a fantastic experience for me
1077673 when ian spoke to me about the captaincy my first thought went to lawrence dallaglio
1077674 he is a great leader and an absolute legend of this game nobody will ever replace him and for me it has been a great honour to play both alongside him at wasps and against him in the international arena
1077675 raf has been an immense captain for france throughout his international career and one of the great players among the wasps squad throughout the last three seasons
1077676 the decision to appoint him as club captain was an easy one what raf has achieved his character and the way he operates is first class and there is no more deserving a man for the job
1077677 the lawyer wanted r20 000 for him to be present during questioning
1077678 he brown will admit that the girl was assaulted and died as a result of a brain haemorrhage but my instructions are that the blood that was found on his jacket belonged to that of a sheep
1077679 his explanation for her blood found on his jacket resulted from the girl suffering from a nosebleed a week before the incident and the accused will say he carried her home because it was a very hot day
1077680 that evening he brown came home and he was very drunk he started shouting at me and hitting me then he pulled my baby child off my back i was so afraid i fled to my aunts place
1077681 when i asked him where asiba was he told me she was still at home i immediately went to our house and a little boy ran out into the street and told me my daughter was lying next to the road
1077682 ultimately it all might come down to how many central banks express an interest to sell in particular the larger holders such as france germany and italy
1077683 but even if likely sales are going to be far less than 500 tonnes such an agreed cap would probably serve a purpose by simply reassuring the market that even very changed circumstances would not see a flood of gold
1077684 so currently we see the chance of there being a cbga iii as very high
1077685 this year we estimate sales are about 315 tonnes with just two months to go and so could again be well below 400 tonnes
1077686 we believe imf gold sales will get congressional approval and will be part of the cbga but the uncertainty is with the timing
1077687 we do not believe that there is as yet a long term revaluation of the role of gold in a central banks portfolio most european central banks remain committed sellers
1077688 if this is correct then gold sales could quickly pick up again perhaps if the dollar was to strengthen and the gold price slip

1077763 i have to say that as a rule cumbria police are excellent i cant comment on individual cases but for it to go all the way to court then be dropped is just not acceptable

1077765 the legal response has failed in dealing with the fact that this is a high risk serial rapist who will only be in his 50s on release and who in all likelihood will re offend

1077767 the committee reiterates its call to the state party to initiate a process of public consultation in northern ireland on the abortion law

1077771 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory than his children are old enough to recognize the consequences

1077809 we are looking for the best the brightest without regard to party affiliation
1077810 the workers at newell and have no idea who he is
1077811 silver was the linchpin in keeping that store open and our members employed his opponents cheap political shot is disgraceful
1077812 we need to attend to the realities of the funding that we need to provide for essential services in new york state
1077813 its eerily similar to what the previous governor had to say
1077814 he talked the talk like this governor is but the real essence of governing in this state is walking the walk
1077815 hes sounding a call to action but what is he going to propose and how tough is he going to get
1077816 he has to move against the powers that be in albany
1077817 the very last thing we should do is to increase costs for health care or limit access to health services for those most in need
1077818 middle class families and our working poor must not be forced to bear the brunt of such cuts
1077819 this state must not backpedal on the important progress we have made
1077820 now that the governor has identified an economic crisis and is calling the legislature back to albany its time for him to embrace our spending cap put it on the agenda and urge the assembly to follow suit
1077821 if it turns into a tax cap tap dance nothing is going to happen
1077822 if this is about adjusting to fundamental new realities then im assuming well get his fundamental new proposals 10 days ahead of the session theres no way that you can have a serious conversation about issues this big in 48 hours
1077823 one gets a little concerned when selling off state assets and budget deficits get mentioned in the same sentence
1077824 if it is our intention to ask working families to shoulder the burden of these cuts we must ensure that our most affluent citizens share that burden
1077825 clearly i want to work very hard and closely with the governor to overcome this financial crisis we have in new york and at the same time enact measures to reduce state spending that does not create cost shifting
1077826 while thats going to be a difficult job weve done it before where weve had fiscal crisis
1077827 we are anxious to hear his specific proposals however we are hopeful the state does not push down its costs through county government to county property taxpayers as has been their past history
1077828 to be frank patersons deeds simply dont match his message
1077829 we could have done without the melodrama it sounded as if new york was in the midst of a great depression rather than a mere slowdown in what is after all one of the most prosperous states in one of the most prosperous economies in the history of the world
1077830 the state has pulled itself out of large budget gaps before most notably after the sept 11 2001 attacks and people shouldnt panic but belt tightening is in order new york families are doing so as paterson himself accurately noted during his speech the state must follow their lead
1077831 paterson made key points and is having to face what we inherited in the city which is not unlike whats happening in the state
1077832 the steps we took are steps the state will surely have to take no new programs and across the board cuts
1077833 demonstrated he is ready to stand up to the interest groups
1077834 in ordering a legislative session on aug 19 the governor made clear he is serious about tackling now deficits that have ballooned to 6 4 billion next year and 26 2 billion over the next three years
1077835 which is not that new york taxes too little but that it spends too much
1077836 were talking about the deficit growing but if we start dealing with that now and making tough choices now we can manage
1077837 the usual rules of the game are that you dont interrupt the legislatures summer vacation in an election year to bring them back to albany to deal with a trivial matter like a severe fiscal downturn
1077838 if hes truly talking about cutting the cost of state government and not just shifting it to local governments then i support him 10 000 percent
1077839 im hoping he says there will be an incentive program for municipalities that downsize their costs to end duplication of government that really needs to be where we go next
1077840 the state is going to have to deliver services as efficiently as possible and making strong priority based decisions just like new york families are being forced to make
1077841 its important to understand counties have been making these hard decisions in the last two years
1077842 paterson spoke the truth tuesday but spoken truths arent the same as spending discipline thats the imperative
1077843 i do understand the importance of the computer i understand the importance of the blogs i am forcing myself let me put it this way i am using the computer more and more every day it doesnt mean that i have to e mail people now i read e mails
1077844 constantly showing them to me as the news breaks during the day
1077845 when youre in shorts everybody looks good because we play without contact but today we were able to get some stuff corrected
1077846 we worked hard on the running game and the play action passing game today
1077847 with the new clock change and the way it is now they have to be able to run the offense without panicking they have to be able to be calm stay calm get in and out of the huddle and set the plays as long as they dont give us a negative play and they execute the offense well be fine

1077857 it sounds to me like she did want to come back but she is so scared to because you never give in and show her the real january and she wanted to keep the other girl in her midst because she doesnt like to be alone i am sure she wasnt expecting to get caught up with the two of you and when she did she chose to stay with the other girl for now because she didnt think you would let her come back and she is scared to basically jan what i am telling you is that the girl does love you alot but it scares the shit out of her and she doesnt know how to handle it if she truly loves you which a part of me thinks she does and wants to come back and be with you and davyne just give her this time that she is asking you for to see what is in her heart plus you can use this opportunity to show her the kind of person i know you are and who you once where and when she sees that january she will come back just give it time she will come to you when she is ready

1077908 there is an urgent need to amend the law as in other western countries abortion is allowed even a day before the delivery in special circumstances like when the couple knows that the child may be born with severe disability

1077910 its the need of the hour that we should legalise abortion as otherwise this will invite illegal means which is more dangerous for our society
1077911 their choice as they are the only ones who will have to look after the child after it is born

1077937 this makes us look like a bunch of hicks and thats not what this is
1077938 i dont think he meant to burn anybody he got some bad counsel to make this all about the bible and god all he needed to do was say he was sorry but he wouldnt do that
1077939 the student goes we support mr freshwater the bible stays
1077940 burn that remained on their childs arm for three or four weeks
1077941 to try to put this in the context of scopes
1077942 this is about the safety and well being of students and protecting their constitutional rights to get an education
1077943 nobodys ever told me to remove my bible or to remove the other religious material hanging on my walls

1077949 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory than his children are old enough to recognise the consequences
1077950 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
1077951 to put this on par with any of the human rights issues is an absolute insult to the integrity of the people who fought and went through the human rights movement
1077952 this is what people do when they have an inability to articulate their point in any constructive way they resort to primal acts of violence any reasonable person would need a logic transplant to begin to understand this level of degraded thinking
1077953 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse

1077959 about the only time ten f 16s take to the sky at the same time is when the whole wing is moving from one base to another training is very expensive flight maintenance hours jet fuel flight operations on the runway etc it also becomes a logistical and safety issue to put that many planes up at the same time you send up one pilot or a pair have then run their sortie and bring them back then the next plane or small group goes ground crews manage the take off and recovery in small numbers at a time and the air operations become safer thats usually the way its done particularly in reserve force training which has less money to spend on such things not only is it a logistical and cost issue for training but f 16 pilots train in pairs and fours because they fight in pairs and fours modern fighter and strike aircraft dont fight in groups of ten so if they really did have ten planes up and they werent going somewhere else then it was not a training exercise it was a scramble
1077960 this amazing report will show that theories of ufos moving in the direction of president bushs crawford tx ranch were accurate a theory that i agreed with and proposed in an article
1077961 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1077962 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1077963 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1077964 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1077965 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1077966 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1077967 the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party

1077977 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in
1077978 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short im not involved in two of the formats and alastair cook hasnt been in the twenty20 side recently i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1077979 you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
1077980 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1077981 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1077982 kp is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge
1077983 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1077984 hes also not shy of making the big decisions those big decisions are not going to affect that style of guy
1077985 he hasnt done too much captaining before so it will be interesting but all i know is he has the support of everyone

1077997 as a director i dont prefer directing my own plays but i am choosy about who directs them as my writer ego comes in the way but getting back to conceptualisation the content of the play determines my taking it up i never forget the audience whom i address i like to indicate to my audience certain paths and views that they could choose to follow one that goes deeper than mere portrayal i see that my work is not reactionary also the group im working with the performance space lack of funds etc inevitably puts restrictions on my visualisation process but i dont see these as obstacles as i am indirectly answerable to the theatre economics therefore i prefer simple sets working more on actors and doing more shows than say hiring a tempo for a set

1078076 the coaches have been at oregon for a long time and have a lot of experience

1078086 i called coach heupel thursday we had been talking a couple of times in the previous weeks he told me to call him thursday and i did he told me that they wanted me to be a sooner and that i had a scholarship that is how the conversation started
1078087 i said i really appreciated it it is a great honor to get an offer from a prestigious program like oklahoma this is great and i could not thank him enough
1078088 we talked about maybe coming up there and seeing coach stoops in the immediate future i am trying to sort it out i might or might not go but i still want to make a final decision before school starts
1078089 i went to their camp but i saw a limited amount of things around there i saw their stadium trophy room and their practice field but i have not been in the stadium or anything like that
1078090 not necessarily it is more along the lines that with an offer from oklahoma i can not overlook a great program like oklahoma they are starting the season off at 3 in the nation they are not a program to just take lightly that is for sure
1078091 he emailed me and i called him back it really was not along the lines of him saying anything to me i just told him that i got an offer oklahoma but that nothing had changed between me and ole miss but at the same time it is exciting to get such a prestigious offer i have to look into it but ole miss is still at the top for me with out a doubt it does not change anything it just brings oklahoma back into the picture

1078103 the navy has not only kept the arsenal ship concept alive and well but they evolved the program from six small dependent combatants into a class of seven independent stealth battleships then had the program funded and pushed through congress in plain sight under the pretext of a more capable program

1078426 to say that i and the 140 000 police officers i represent throughout england and wales are appalled and disgusted with the decision that david bieber will now not serve a whole life sentence is a gross understatement and my heart goes out to pc ian broadhursts family
1078427 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues
1078428 david bieber is a monster with no consideration for life
1078429 the fact that his appeal was initially lodged on the grounds that it contravened his human rights is ludicrous
1078430 he showed no mercy or concern for human rights when he ignored pc broadhursts appeal pleading for his life before being executed at point blank range
1078431 every day police officers put their lives on the line for society
1078432 these are the same officers that high court judges take for granted to protect them and their families

1078434 this decision is an insult to all police officers and is nothing more than a green light for those evil thugs who have a complete disregard for life itself and think nothing of killing a police officer

1078439 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power

1078491 i just want to go out and play to as many people as i can
1078492 thats what this albums for i dont care if it sells a million records but if i can get a million people to come out and see me live thats even better
1078493 there are different textures and it rocks a lot harder
1078494 i know i made a better album than i imagined i could have made and im a hard person to please
1078495 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life
1078496 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
1078497 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
1078498 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
1078499 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like weezer or the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
1078500 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
1078501 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
1078502 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
1078503 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
1078504 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus

1078518 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1078519 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1078520 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1078521 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1078522 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1078523 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1078524 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1078525 if we could vote on the best ones and also offer design feedback to anyone who asks

1078530 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1078531 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1078532 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1078533 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle

1078537 i recall brian mentioning that he had a lot of largely instrumental tracks hed accumulated and since in his words he hates writing words i suggested i have a go at writing some words and tunes over a few of them and we see what happens
1078538 when we started this work we started to think we were making something like electronic gospel a music where singing was the central event but whose sonic landscapes were not the type normally associated with that way of singing
1078539 this thought tapped into my long love affair with gospel music which curiously was inadvertently initiated by david and the talking heads
1078540 the live shows will maybe try to draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30 years ago a little bit anyway
1078541 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1078542 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight
1078543 this performance is for my mama the woman who drove me to chicago at the age of 3 and said baby

1078549 when you look at the staggering box office of this current film which actress wouldnt want to jump in
1078550 producers are convinced that the role of the riddler is perfect for depp johnnys a pro hell be able to take direction and still make the character his own and what better penguin is there than philip seymour hoffman
1078551 batman begins 3 where he could do the same kind of gritty down and dirty work that heath ledger was able to do both actors are famous but
1078552 mayor daley ridiculed gov blagojevich today for offering state troopers and national guard equipment to combat chicago crime the governor called out of control at the same time the governor is cutting the states law enforcement budget
1078553 daley read out loud from a list of blagojevichs budget cuts during a news conference called to tout results of chicagos gun buy back program
1078554 it happened after the mayor was told that blagojevich had complained that daley wasnt returning his calls about the governors newly downsized capital plan which is no longer bankrolled by casino expansion
1078555 the last call i got was after his press conference where he said he wanted to help us in regard to law enforcement
1078556 then i read that he cut 4 8 million in the ill department of corrections community based re entry program for ex offenders almost 3 million from the ill state police 100 000 out of the south suburban major crimes task force 7 million out of the department of juvenile justice 600 000 out of the ill violence prevention authority and 1 2 million out of a diversion program for non violent offenders
1078557 this has nothing to do with politics but lets get the facts straight
1078558 i respect him ive worked with him over eight years on his elections and everything
1078559 the image or even the possibility of state troopers and national guard equipment patrolling the streets of chicago generated negative headlines around the world at a time when the city is one of four finalists to host the 2016 summer olympic games
1078560 cubs chairman crane kenney hopes to convince the city that flexibility in scheduling night games on weekends is needed to keep the players fresh and that concerns over neighborhood congestion are no longer relevant because of the influx of bars and restaurants in the 20 years since the ordinance was enacted
1078561 since the cubs often return from trips on thursday nights piniella said the players would benefit with extra rest if they played at night on friday or saturday
1078562 the best sf novel of the year a profound moral and scientific inquiry into the nature and existence of god
1078563 a delicious read intelligent emotionally engaging peopled with interesting characters and driven by a thoughtful narrative that does not shy away from confronting profound questions how can you go wrong
1078564 the aliens arguments for gods existence are the most convincing i have seen since thomas aquinas maybe more so for fiction to be called literature the story should stay with readers and keep them thinking about it long after the book has been put away sawyer has accomplished this with calculating god
1078565 exciting and emotional sawyer smoothly combines ethical questions and comical dialogue in a highly absorbing tale
1078566 an ambitious and extremely funny science fiction adventure calculating god is the most captivating work of science fiction ive read since carl sagans contact
1078567 if the words science fiction conjure up images of spaceships ray guns and bug eyed monsters settle down with this novel and discover that in the right hands science fiction can be literature
1078568 sawyer is a writer of boundless confidence and bold scientific extrapolation
1078569 sawyer has good things to say about the world about people he deals in a currency of goodwill where the trust that we hand him at the start of the book is repaid with interest in the thoughtful and frequently emotional denouements
1078570 by any reckoning sawyer is among the most successful canadian authors ever
1078571 sawyer has undoubtedly cemented his reputation as one of the foremost science fiction writers of our generation
1078572 its hard to think of a modern sf author with dreams as vast as those of the internationally acclaimed robert j sawyer

1078584 all of us in the olympic family hope that the beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country
1078585 the mere fact that the olympic games are coming to china home to nearly 20 percent of the worlds population is significant a billion television viewers are expected to watch live coverage of the opening ceremonies on friday

1078588 china is a nation in transition with great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1078589 the birds nest and the water cube are already architectural landmarks long after these games end these and other olympic venues will encourage youth of china to participate in sport spectators will be inspired to become athletes and athletes will be inspired to achieve their best in world class venues
1078590 new airport terminals new roads and highways new parks and a host of other projects that were initiated or accelerated because of the games will improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas economic development over the long term

1078603 we can drill the south lawn of the white house and we will still only have 3 percent of the worlds oil reserves yet we are using 25 of the worlds daily oil supply
1078604 we are not victims in this energy crisis we have some control over the situation we need to agree on a comprehensive plan that moves us toward energy independence through responsible drilling increasing efficiency investing in renewables and decreasing consumption thats what it will take to bring down fuel costs steward our resources and ensure americas long term energy security

1078613 this will be a great opportunity to gel and a great learning experience for our team to visit a foreign country and have a chance to see some of the world
1078614 thats the big thing and then the reward is getting to come here and play the games
1078615 id be concerned right now if we were two weeks into preparation for our first game were not ready
1078616 but the early practices and exhibition games really gives us a chance to make some progress heading into the fall
1078617 i think this trip was incredibly beneficial coming down here and playing the games sometimes its good for the guys to be able to see that maybe were not as organized as they think and weve got to be more of a basketball team
1078618 for us it was a great time from the standpoint that we now have a veteran team
1078619 at the same time we want to get these young guys caught up to speed

1078632 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
1078633 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
1078634 i came to realise how much we take at face value
1078635 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
1078636 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
1078637 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter
1078638 sheer incredulity to the conviction that its all just an elaborate joke
1078639 without a platform for communication a head count is almost impossible
1078640 if you will forgive my use of the term global
1078641 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
1078642 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
1078643 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
1078644 as a rule of thumb we dont have any fears of aircraft or other modes of transportation
1078645 flat earth theory is one of the ultimate conspiracy theories
1078646 naturally flat earth believers think that the moon landings were faked as were the photographs of earth from space
1078647 this program requires a data connection please contact your carrier or visit
1078648 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
1078649 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
1078650 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
1078651 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
1078652 even with the waiver authority this provision would impose a significant impediment to the timely and effective collection of critical intelligence
1078653 this provision conflicts with the presidents authority to control dissemination of classified information
1078654 withhold 75 of the funding for covert action programs until the administration provides much greater access to highly sensitive national security information to all members of the congressional intelligence committees
1078655 undermine the fundamental compact between the congress and the president on reporting highly sensitive intelligence matters

1078663 this film is very important for me as i play the solo heroine in the film
1078664 i have done various films where i have played important roles i have done special appearances played supporting actress or was one of the two or more heroines but this is my film where i am the solo heroine
1078665 i find comedy the most difficult thing to do i dont have many comic scenes to perform in the film as i am playing a middle class girl who is the sister of under world don played by mithun chakraborty
1078666 i had one of my best experiences of working with sachin yardi and i think he has taken the best out of me as ritu da rituparno ghosh does

1078670 i accepted a supper date with several young men from the racquet club including robert collier son of the publisher of colliers weekly and monty waterbury the handsome young polo star it took place in a private room at rectors with a colored orchestra to entertain us it was loads of fun young more suited to my age than stanford and his friends these boys were full of the very dickens they flattered me by competing for my attention in a gay convivial fashion monty waterbury sat me on a chair behind a screen stood on a chair on the other side and fed me blue points over the top
1078671 stands out both for the breadth of its musical implications and the depth of its mathematical content
1078672 the music of the spheres isnt really a metaphor some musical spaces really are spheres
1078673 the whole point of making these geometric spaces is that at the end of the day it helps you understand music better having a powerful set of tools for conceptualizing music allows you to do all sorts of things you hadnt done before
1078674 you could create new kinds of musical instruments or new kinds of toys
1078675 you could create new kinds of visualization tools imagine going to a classical music concert where the music was being translated visually we could change the way we educate musicians there are lots of practical consequences that could follow from these ideas
1078676 the most satisfying aspect of this research is that we can now see that there is a logical structure linking many many different musical concepts to some extent we can represent the history of music as a long process of exploring different symmetries and different geometries
1078677 have western composers already discovered the essential and most important musical objects
1078678 if so then western music is more than just an arbitrary set of conventions it may be that the basic objects of western music are fantastically special in which case it would be quite difficult to find alternatives to broadly traditional methods of musical organization
1078679 our methods are not so great at distinguishing aerosmith from the rolling stones
1078680 but they might allow you to visualize some of the differences between john lennon and paul mccartney and they certainly help you understand more deeply how classical music relates to rock or is different from atonal music
1078681 im so in love with you whatever you want to do is all right by me

1078686 it is time for kentucky to join many other states in refusing this failed experiment of abstinence only until marriage programs as long as funds are going to these programs that place ideology over what the evidence says works young people and other underserved groups in kentucky are going to continue to suffer
1078687 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language an behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word
1078688 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1078689 although we have seen real progress in the last two years if we want to continue to see results we will need to see more financial resources and commitment

1078691 the conscience of the individual or institution should be paramount in determining what constitutes abortion

1078694 civil rights initiative has been proposed and would amend the nebraska constitution if enacted
1078695 its basically a ban on a common method of second trimester abortion
1078696 of course dr tiller is disappointed that the court did not take this opportunity to end his political prosecution and clear the huge roadblock that lies in the path of women who choose to exercise their right to get a lawful abortion in kansas

1078709 mccains latest attempt at discrediting his handsome photogenic young rival particularly galls stars and executives with a memory because only eight years ago mccain was a fixture in hollywood fundraising circles when he tried to raise money from the very people his ad now ridicules at the time dozens of people in hollywood including lear harrison ford quincy jones berry gordy and michael douglas gave to mccain because they thought he was a republican celebrity with a great personal story and dare we say some celebrities namely warren beatty even became friends with the arizona senator but the truth is most of hollywood wont return mccains calls nowadays because many of the stars and executives he initially impressed now believe the maverick stance they found so attractive was just a pose
1078710 all very interesting stuff but there was an assumption that male behaviour was what pushed women away or even a perception of it as unfeminine rather than simple lack of interest in technology other than as end users among women and particularly females of school and college age

1078730 i think thats the first thing that jumps out at you hes real smart he plays end he plays nose some guys get affected by being moved around needing time to adjust but he doesnt you go into a game with a guy like that knowing youre covered it certainly adds to a guys value
1078731 ive played both end and tackle so i guess im kind of like the utility guy
1078732 they are like two different mentalities though you really have to beef up to play nose tackle whereas at end youre thinking more in terms of finesse and speed when you play games thats where you pick up the confidence where you realize you can play both
1078733 i was just able to play instead of thinking so much its funny but when you understand what it is youre supposed to do the game slows down before you reach that point youre trying to think through this or that instead of just looking and seeing whats going on
1078734 its like when youre opposite a tight end you can see that their weights forward
1078735 instead of having to ask yourself what are you doing you already know what youre doing and you just do it youre not racing in your mind with thoughts

1078799 its tough especially when you have guys youve built a relationship with in felipes case i was here with him for two years in pauls case i got to know him both as a teammate and while playing against him its just tough to see anybody go and you hate to see it when they are good guys apparently they team management want to take a look at some of those young guys
1078800 from a players standpoint my mindset is to come to the yard every day and play but the business side of the game is something you always have to be aware of learn and adjust its tough sometimes but you have to deal with that business stuff too
1078801 i want to be ready if manny acta needs someone late in a game or he needs someone to go in there and play the position well i want to be able do a good job there if he needs me
1078802 i have been working really hard on just being calm at the plate and not trying to do too much if the pitcher is going to give me a single i am going to take it i am not only trying not to worry too much but lenny harris is working with me on relaxing my lower half of my body and just stepping to the plate and taking what they are giving me he always tells me if i just go up there and hit the ball hard good things are going to happen and the last couple of weeks its been working
1078803 i take great pride in it fielding my dad who also coached ryan always told me growing up you have to separate the two and its a great feeling if i am struggling at the plate but i help the team win on the defensive side plus its a great feeling because most of the time the pitcher has made a mistake and its great to bail him out you see how fired up he the pitcher gets as a result of it many times a nice defensive play can give the pitcher that extra energy to get him out of a jam
1078804 yes exactly and that is a good point knowing you are helping your teammate and your teammate appreciates your effort smiling broadly it is a great feeling
1078805 fortunately i have had the chance to get some starts the past couple of weeks i want to be ready for whatever role the team wants for me whether thats giving someone a day off get some starts or even coming off the bench i want to be ready everyday and i feel like my preparation the past couple of weeks is one of the very reasons i have done well i want continue with that
1078806 i do pausing thoughtfully i really do it has turned out to be one of those odd things especially during this current losing streak where we just cant put both sides of the game together at the same time we got unbelievable pitching for about five or six days in a row then we couldnt produce anything with the bat while it hasnt been quite the output we produced in atlanta with the 15 runs in that one game the last couple of nights we put runs on the board and ran into some kinks out in the field made some bad pitches in some tough situations but i truly believe if we can put both sides of the game together for a two to three week stretch the fans are going to see some good results there is talent here we just havent been able to put it all together
1078807 it really has that is exactly correct i have never been involved in the amount of injuries which have gotten in the way of this team we just cant seem to get everyone on the field at the same time while it was nice having zim ryan zimmerman austin kearns back we get zim and kearns back at the time we lost lastings milledge and elijah dukes and dukes had started to play so incredibly well now getting elijah back we can keep our fingers crossed that zim is not out for too long after being hit on the wrist last thursday if we can get everybody back on the field then with the way some of the pitchers have been pitching i really think we can put up a good last two months
1078808 it was and it was silent in the dugout how much more can we take when he came back into the clubhouse we all saw the lump on his hand i think everyone kind of feared the worst broken but evidently it looks like he wont miss too much time
1078809 yeah i know when he came back into the dugout after he scored the run it looked like someone slipped a golf ball underneath his hand chuckling it was quite amazing i have had some bumps like that but nothing that swelled that quickly it looked bad and we are fortunate his wrist was not broken
1078810 i think it does anytime you have a guy that goes out on the field lays it all out on the line never gives up everyday and you see that man go down it can be pretty deflating zimmerman but at the same time someone else must step up and take the reigns and lead by example in fact i think that is something both zim and austin do very well lead by example neither of them are rah rah guys and when they go down others need to keep the ship moving knowing the effort those two bring to the field every single day
1078811 manny is always talking about that you cant let injuries get you down you got to keep on moving because the season is going to go on without them if you dwell on something like that everything is going to spiral down
1078812 no he is that way positive no matter what goes on we had early batting practice yesterday and hes out there watching and participating in the early bp he was encouraging 4 or 5 of us he really is the type of guy you really want to play for everyone just wants to leave everything out on the field for him hes a good leader
1078813 he is always out there during batting practice he will be out on the field with pete orr fielding groundballs and not only with just pete but all the fielders he gets out there and gets his hands dirty just like every other player on the team

1079125 the field at baptist is in the worst shape ive seen it in 10 years
1079126 my suspicion is that the announcement of the festival may have been designed more to help raise money from investors than anything else
1079127 if it doesnt proceed that may mean theres been little progress on the money front its apparent solomont doesnt want to risk his money on the venture
1079128 no schedule has been published nor has there been any further announcement concerning the festival or the ibls activities so im beginning more and more to think this may be more show than substance

1079142 we cannot see god as we see an apple tree or a neon sign that is in a purely external way that requires no interior commitment we can see him only by becoming like him by reaching the level of reality on which god exists in other words by being liberated from what is anti divine the quest for pleasure enjoyment possessions gain or in a word from ourselves we can see god only if we turn around stop looking for him as we might look for street signs and dollar bills and begin looking away from the visible to the invisible
1079143 mans experience of anything outside of himself is always associated with experience of himself he never experiences anything external without having at the same time the experience of himself
1079144 the priest is the instrument of this merciful love of god
1079145 the contemporary world continues to present contradictions so clearly outlined by the fathers of the second vatican council cf
1079146 the priest in the sacrament of confession is the instrument of this merciful love of god whom he invokes in the formula of the absolution of sins
1079147 the new testament speaks on every page of gods love and mercy which are made visible in christ
1079148 those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick do i have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
1079149 the duty of the priest and the confessor is primarily this to bring every person to experience the love of christ encountering him on the path of their own lives as paul met him on the road to damascus
1079150 this is his personal experience on the way to damascus the lord jesus loved paul and gave himself for him
1079151 may every person have this same spiritual experience and as the servant of god john paul ii said rediscover
1079152 the priest minister of the sacrament of reconciliation must always consider it his duty to make transpire in words and in drawing near to the penitent the merciful love of god
1079153 dear brothers all this means that the priest engaged in the ministry of the sacrament of penance is himself motivated by a constant tending to holiness
1079154 the confessor should have a proven knowledge of christian behaviour experience of human affairs respect and sensitivity toward the one who has fallen he must love the truth be faithful to the magisterium of the church and lead the penitent with patience toward healing and full maturity he must pray and do penance for his penitent entrusting him to the lords mercy
1079155 zacchaeus come down quickly for today i must stay at your house
1079156 half of my possessions lord i shall give to the poor and if i have extorted anything from anyone i shall repay it four times over
1079157 whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them and whose sins you shall retain they are retained
1079158 we never really face ourselves until we face someone else as well some other human being this is for example at the heart of the twelve steps of alcoholics anonymous you must not only face your faults and the harm they have caused but you must face someone else and admit this to him the very existence of the sacrament of penance is psychologically sound this is why we need confession of our sins before another human being
1079159 it is all too easy to try to console ourselves by thinking that we need only go to god in fact this really means that we simply stay inside ourselves i can speak of this with a good deal of certainty because it is part of my own experience for a long time i preached on penance and spoke of the necessity of it but i was not really using it there were parts of me that i did not want anyone to see and i was convinced that i could handle them myself somehow and then come before god or another human being with the satisfaction of being repentant but having done a good job at self rehabilitation it did not work

1079227 ive been running my own business for 22 years and the only people who are interested in hearing my problems are other small business owners
1079228 friends and family are tired of hearing me talk about the difficulties of running a small business and quite honestly if theyre in working at large corporations they often look down on my company thats why i started this blog ive put up a few articles just to get things going but its open to everyone to say anything they want
1079229 one of the reasons i created this blog is that i need help even after all these years i dont know how to apportion raises or properly review employees and im tired of reading articles by academics or large company executives who have never had to dig into their own pockets to make certain everyone gets paid on time
1079230 secu investigated the reverse mortgage marketplace and we saw numerous opportunities to provide this important product to our members reducing the typical costs being assessed through reduced fees a fixed rate of interest and a simple interest accrual method we will provide the member with an enhanced use of their equity this will result in more funds being made available to the member in order to assist with their day to day living expenses the features of the secu reverse mortgage are very consistent with our do the right thing philosophy
1079231 a reverse mortgage can be a useful financial option for some older homeowners who need to supplement their retirement income to help pay for essential needs since each homeowners situation is unique and reverse mortgages differ significantly in payment options and fees it is important to receive face to face counseling with a certified reverse mortgage counselor prior to applying for a loan certified reverse mortgage counselors in north carolina are trained to provide consumers with information on reverse mortgage products and other services available to older adults that will help them make informed financial decisions
1079232 if you are considering a reverse mortgage you should shop around and talk to a counselor to make sure you are getting the product that is right for you reverse mortgages are complex products and choosing the wrong one can cost you thousands of dollars and even possibly your home
1079233 seniors in the market for this type of product can be extremely vulnerable there are media ads promising too good to be true products that are ultimately not in the best interest of the borrower consumer education is crucial in making sure the older population does not fall victim to what could become the next frontier for mortgage scams we are pleased secu has developed a consumer friendly product to assist ncs retired state employees
1079234 i strongly encourage all north carolinians considering a reverse mortgage to investigate the available options consult with family members and compare products in the marketplace

1079260 stereo 3d is still in its infancy in many ways
1079261 we have been making impressive 3d movies but live transmissions bring their own unique challenges like every live show theres less time to make corrections and no room for error one of the big challenges has also been how to keep the parallel signals in perfect synchronisation thats a special challenge over satellite links where atmospheric conditions can be problematic to do this we have developed a solution where we multiplex the 3d signals into a single 2d signal for transmission at the receiving end we then un wrap the 2d signal back into a 3d picture we have done this before but not over such a long link and internationally we have also developed the twin camera systems that will be capturing the images in this case we will be using two camera rigs to show that 3d pictures can be cut and mixed live
1079262 this is a natural progression from last years live hd interview with robert zemeckis we are working with a group of technology partners who are at the cutting edge of 3d imaging and transmission
1079263 arqiva is delighted to have been asked to provide the communications technology and expertise behind this important and high profile 3d event our interest and experience in the digital cinema market means we are very happy to use our global assets to showcase the exciting opportunities that new technology is bringing to live event organisers and exhibitors

1079265 we manage the separate images with a special adapter that fits on the projector which then transmits the left and right eye images through the glasses to the viewer said real ds president joshua greer
1079266 the vast majority of 3d equipped theatres around the world are using real d because its not only simple to install but easy to operate with our very low cost glasses that users can keep it avoids a lot of staff intensive handling and the picture quality is truly awesome
1079267 but setting the pace is what we do each year at ibc the technology we are using is exciting enough but to have jeffrey katzenberg addressing our delegates in conversation with our good friend elizabeth daley is a real treat and unique privilege this really is the genesis of a new age in immersive cinema and broadcasting it will be a very special night for everyone

1079301 un d a en la vida de iv n denisovich
1079302 in wales life is based very much around community so ten miles counts its tough for cardiff people to do business in swansea or the valleys above pontypridd
1079303 you have to be more network orientated over less in england i could pitch on a whole region or even national level in wales its cardiff at best unless i am introduced network and knowing people is everything in wales
1079304 i state early in any conversation that i live in wales thats as important as where the business address is for instance bristol based businesses will find it difficult to sell in wales hiring a welsh home located salesman or opening a welsh based office will change the effect dramatically reputation and being part of the welsh community is of key importance
1079305 it doesnt take long to work a route through the system to speak to anyone anywhere in wales
1079306 if you are outside of the 3 major population centres of south wales then business networking is very much limited to your local chamber of commerce if there is one
1079307 the population density and correspondingly business density outside of the three major areas is significantly reduced especially the further west you venture a lot of businesses in rural areas would be cynical towards the idea of networking with strangers and struggle to understand the potential value to their businesses weve always done it this way and its always worked kind of attitude even though they might be working every hour possible and struggling to make any headway its as if working every possible hour is seen as an honourable thing to do or a sign of success to the outside world
1079308 north wales does very little business with south wales and vice versa the government has tried to help this situation by providing one off events but the geography of the country is such that it will always be a barrier therefore it is far easier for companies in the south to deal with bristol or london or anywhere in between and for the north walians to deal with liverpool and manchester
1079309 in the solution for a replacement thats being negotiated cardiff people want it their way while newport and swansea dont want to be seen being wholly consumed as part of cardiffs solution for cardiffs problems there is much in fighting between the communities at many levels government socially business sport etc for inward investment projects communities will fight and try and out bid each other the inter community politics at times can be awful its no different for business
1079310 this is now a truly global economy and welsh business owners will miss out on opportunities if they are not actively looking to network and do business with people in the rest of the uk europe and worldwide they will not survive and grow if they only do business with who they know now
1079311 while the people in both areas are business focussed i find over the bridge in england people like to do business first and get to know you afterwards in wales it is definitely the other way around
1079312 in our networking groups in cardiff and newport we have had many visitors from england they have recognised that the welsh way of doing business is different from the english way and that is where networking groups come to the fore when trying to break into the business market in wales
1079313 there is no great divide between welsh amp english businesses but particularly in wales people like to do business with people they know and if they get to know you through networking they will be comfortable working with you
1079314 if you go out to build a network people can see you coming from a mile away
1079315 is networking in a large organisation different for women to men and do women need to be more proactive or act differently in any way
1079316 one of the worst mistakes i made was to stay head down in the business in the early days and not go out to events and network with others in the industry
1079317 from the security guard to the president of the company
1079318 if youre there give your best what the heck otherwise youre just breathing air
1079319 be brave you need to take the opportunities that come your way and although you wont always succeed you will be noticed
1079320 build your network of contacts knowledge of your industry should be as wide as it is deep
1079321 i am a valuable individual with a lot to give and people around here have equally so much to share

1079338 la guardia revolucionaria ha probado recientemente un arma naval con un rango de 300 kil metros con la que ning n barco estar a salvo y ser enviado a las profundidades
1079339 esta arma es totalmente novedosa y semejante tecnolog a no tiene precedentes en ninguna parte del mundo hasta donde tenemos conocimiento
1079340 con esta arma ninguna nave enemiga se atrever a invadir las aguas de ir n ya que en ese caso ser hundido hasta el fondo de las aguas
1079341 he estado en guerreo y pude ver que las mam s son muy entusiastas pues muchas de ellas tiene que caminar hasta cuatro horas para llegar a donde se realiza cada 14 d as la medici n de los ni os para valorar su crecimiento y donde ellas mismas se dan consejos una a la otra de las cosas que investigaron de temas com salud
1079342 cuando est s ah la emoci n general la energ a que se genera con todas estas mujeres que sacan adelante a sus hijos algunas de ellas solas porque el marido est del otro lado trabajando y tal vez a veces les manda dinero y a veces no porque ya encontraron a otra mujer en estados unidos eso es muy impactante
1079343 ver a un chavito que ten a desnutrici n pero que ahora ya est creciendo y verlos a los ojos es muy conmovedor yo te puedo contar muchas historias y la gente que se entere de ellas hasta puede llorar pero creo que aqu lo importante es el mensaje es hac a a sociedad para que se sume al reto kilo y que nos hagamos consientes de lo que pasa en m xico creo que eso es lo importante
1079344 somos una especie de voceros tratando de hacer conciencia y un llamado a la sociedad al gobierno y las empresas para que volteen para ac y se enteren de este programa
1079345 quiero acudir a las comunidades y ver de cerca el resultado de este trabajo y compartirle a la gente con testimonios y con esta calidez que da el estar cerca mostrar lo que est logrado el kilo de ayuda y lo mucho que hay por hacer me parece que ah es donde hay que poner el nfasis pues la tarea es enorme
1079346 a candidate who is primed to take advantage of web power and a generation used to relating thinking talking and meeting online
1079347 you fund political parties the way barack obama has funded his so lots of people have their share of ownership
1079348 the upper limit on any individual contribution should be 100
1079349 the young officers i knew when i reported on the streets of belfast in the 60s and 70s are now generals and retired generals and they tell me things they wouldnt tell a young reporter
1079350 the second and third secretaries i met in cambodia and vietnam are now ambassadors and ex ambassadors and they tell me things they wouldnt tell a young reporter
1079351 in our bid to encourage skilled workers to move to northern ireland it is vital that our cmon over message reaches our target audience our decision to embrace social networking and facebook in particular was based on its increasing popularity and the fact that the site has the same demographic we wish to interact with
1079352 somos m s y m s valientes que los que ultrajan la corona somos m s que los que asesinan y reclaman la independencia del pa s vasco somos m s los que nos sentimos orgullosos de sentir los colores de nuestro pa s
1079353 i am not looking to set up a big website niche networks have always been the case its never been about big networks its about quality and interest to other members fashion is what i do so its very topical and it has to be relevant
1079354 the idea came from the fact that more and more people are rebelling against the old institutional values and ways of doing things
1079355 in rebel island we are attracting people who are looking for new values and new ways of evolving both professionally and personally
1079356 by creating a social network we get to synergise and leverage many brains internationally before the growth of this technology it would have been so much more difficult inefficient and expensive to do so particularly across time zones
1079357 when we were looking for finance we approached all of the usual brokers attended countless seminars and breakfast meetings and paid several thousands of pounds for introductions to financiers and got nothing the more we spoke to entrepreneurs the more we became aware that it was a common problem
1079358 what it does is maximise the angels minimal resource time rather than travel all over the country meeting entrepreneurs they can log in and see the latest initiatives online
1079359 in the meantime entrepreneurs have low cost access to so many more potential investors than they have ever had and valuable feedback that helps them to hone their ideas
1079360 some people are stimulated by reading blogs others by looking at new products we also now have an online magazine where people can submit and read articles on a range of relevant subjects
1079361 it all helps me keep people engaged and reinforces the roubi brand
1079362 one member told me that it is the only network he is on where he has ever sold anything
1079363 real world events have proven to be just as valuable we have just run a speedfunding event where 24 entrepreneurs met 24 angels the entrepreneur had three minutes to pitch the angel and then the angel had one minute to ask questions they then changed partners
1079364 the response to this has been phenomenal there was a tremendous buzz and following the first event there were 62 further meetings in the days that followed at this early stage 16 out of the 24 entrepreneurs present are hopeful of securing a deal
1079365 its a crazy kind of networking it allows the angels to meet so many people not all whom theyd love and like similarly it gives the power back to the entrepreneurs allowing them to gauge how well they get on with the entrepreneur and whether theyd want them on board
1079366 ive always kept a good record of the contacts i make
1079367 initially it was a rolodex just cards going around now im like everyone else i have an electronic database
1079368 in certain hotels they make a note of what you like or dont like whether you like freesias in your hotel room for example so i started to make a note of my contacts preferences if they adored sticky toffee pudding for example
1079369 i keep notes so that every time someones name pops up it reminds me of interesting things about them relatives former jobs where i met them things like that i dont put anything too terrible down just in case that person happens to be looking over my shoulder as i update their entry
1079370 when i left the bbc i started bringing people together for very simple informal lunches in my flat in covent garden just to stay in touch with the people id met on any questions
1079371 i wasnt doing anything commercial anyone i particularly liked id invite them to my annual party or to a lunch
1079372 gradually one or two chairmen and chief execs of some large companies said could you bring people like this together for me either because they wanted to stay in touch with what was happening in the world or because they wanted to talk about a particular subject that affected their companies and out of that a consultancy business grew
1079373 the last several years ive held what i call my salons again its very simple just friends and colleagues gathering to share a glass of wine and good conversation on a regular basis on the whole its nice when you meet people to be able to say im always there on a monday night or im always there on friday lunchtime whether its in a room in a bar or in your home you do something short and sharp for about an hour and a half any longer and people coming early or late miss each other
1079374 last year yougov approached me and said weve got a panel of 300 000 400 000 public consumers maybe you could form a panel of influentials
1079375 if companies or other organisations want to know what the general public think they come to yougov if they want to know what the influentials think perhaps responding to slightly different or more in depth questions they come to yougovstone it adds another string to their bow
1079376 the key is that you must have a reputation for being reliable
1079377 return calls when you say you will get in touch do so send information when you promised you would
1079378 there are too many people who dont follow through who dont send something when they say they will and who when they have offered to put you in touch with someone dont actually do it of course there are some people whose contact details you cant give out but you can always say ill forward it for you its about being generous with your contacts
1079379 whenever i come back from an event i always make notes of what ive promised to do to make sure that i follow up immediately if you do so daily its not too big a job but if you let it pile up you lose the contacts youve made
1079380 our target is to be able to get the cost of co2 capture down significantly
1079381 its going to cost quite a bit of money and its going to cost quite a bit of plant efficiency
1079382 the bad financial situation can make people and municipalities realize that going green is in their economic interest
1079383 and by the way that change can help green your house and green your city
1079384 people get discouraged when they think theres nothing they can do and here is something they can do
1079385 people may object to global warming but this is about lowering the costs of operations less waste on the landfill its kind of hard for someone to object to all of those things
1079386 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1079387 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1079388 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1079389 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner

1079391 but 11 years old and he has parkinsonism thats the youngest one that were certainly dealing with here for sure
1079392 polls may be saying that women in their 40s and 50s will be the new swing vote in the 2008 presidential election but the silent generation women could be the stealth vote that puts the title of president in front of senator mccain instead of senator obama
1079393 they think of themselves as 10 to15 years younger than their chronological age
1079394 so a presidents age is not an issue to the silent generation www agingstats gov older generations are enjoying better health than any previous older generation in american history
1079395 they had super heroes for role models and deeply competent public figures like president franklin roosevelt and general dwight eisenhower silents want to know that they are voting for the most qualified candidate
1079396 gratuitous comments about senator clintons hair styles wrinkles cleavage and pant suits diverted from the seriousness of her political message
1079397 the silent generation of women the hidden electorate that could determine who will be the next president of the u s may turn to mccain not only for their generational values but also because they feel that neither candidate obama the democratic party nor the media gave the first serious female presidential candidate a fair shake

1079409 i wish youd tell me mr brown how you do it i have six hundred men in my church in this camp and if i gave them six months notice they couldnt meet that record tell me how you do it

1079412 well you seemed to have difficulty in asking a blessing on the bread has something happened
1079413 a few hours ago i was over germany and france on a bombing mission we had made our run left our calling cards meaning the bombs and when we gained altitude and were about to return across the channel we ran into heavy flak my tail assembly was pretty well shot away one of my engines was out a number of my crew were wounded and it looked like a hopeless situation it seemed like no power in heaven or earth could get us back across the channel to a landing field but
1079414 brother brown up there i remembered what my mother had said to me and this i want to say to this vast audience both those that are here and those that are listening in this is what my mother said if ever you find yourself in a situation where man cant help you call on god
1079415 when i heard of this meeting i ran all the way to get here and when i knelt at the table and named his name again i remembered shamefully that i had not stopped to say thank you and thats the reason i paused to express my gratitude for the goodness of god
1079416 well have to dismiss or you wont get any chow
1079417 we can have chow any time lets have a testimony meeting

1079421 how do you do it how did you know which of those fellows to call on
1079422 it didnt make any difference which one i called on they are all prepared and this could happen in any camp anywhere in the world where there are seventy five young mormon boys
1079423 thou art the christ the son of the living god

1079433 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
1079434 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
1079435 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
1079436 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
1079437 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
1079438 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent

1079443 depending on the type of drug and how long youve been taking it it can remain in your system from one to five days
1079444 to be on the safe side always ask the pharmacist about the effects of your medications on sun exposure theyll go online and get current accurate information
1079445 there have been some bad cases tanning booths primarily emit uva rays and thats what medications mainly interact with
1079446 i recommend spf 15 the stronger sunscreens often give people a false sense of security
1079447 spf 15 is fine for going to and from the store but use spf 30 for longer sun exposure or if youre taking medications
1079448 a problem is that these ingredients arent stable for a very long time
1079449 most people use at best half of what they need if you put it on too thin it doesnt give you protection
1079450 sunscreen wears off when youre sweating or in the water remember to cover your hands and feet with sunscreen too
1079451 the dual challenge of managing cost inflation and soft consumer demand were the critical business issues for us food companies coming into 2008
1079452 we had every expectation that this would be a very difficult year after a rough period in 2007 the major branded food companies have been able to reverse declining margins companies like kraft kellogg and hershey have seen significant improvement in gross margins during the second quarter if those trends continue and commodities stabilize or even begin to come down we can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel for those companies
1079453 companies like ralcorp have had the luxury of increasing prices and increasing unit sales volume as consumers migrate to less expensive private label products
1079454 the consumer has had to absorb substantial price increases over the past year across all retail food categories the increase has been just over 5 within the past 12 months and 10 or more in many hard hit categories like dairy
1079455 what is surprising however is that the consumer is by no means absorbing all of the impact of surging commodity costs a significant amount of commodity inflation is being off set by efficiencies elsewhere in the supply chain and company gross margins are down since this crisis began we are seeing the pain of commodity costs almost equally shared across consumers investors and companies ability to operate more efficiently

1079690 openbravo and ubuntu its time to adopt an erp that truly adapts to your needs
1079691 the survey findings speak to the need to make retirement income a primary concern when developing an investment strategy regardless of the clients age
1079692 the challenge advisors face is getting investors to understand that the traditional approach to income planning may not allow them to achieve the standard of living they are expecting in retirement by exposing this shortfall and effectively positioning managed accounts as a customizable retirement income solution advisors can add real value to their client relationships
1079693 listening to advisors has never been more important especially as the industry gains complexity and the advisors role continues to evolve
1079694 proactively seeking feedback from advisors is an integral part of curians corporate development strategy by maintaining an ongoing dialogue with our advisor partners we are able to improve the effectiveness of the platform expand the relevance of managed accounts to a broader investor set and build a foundation for curians continued growth

1079701 the unmatched knowledge and understanding of our philanthropic beliefs and workplace culture was a top reason we chose the principal r
1079702 the principal also had the flexibility to meet our investment requirements and the technology to help reduce our administrative workload
1079703 were honored to provide retirement services to memorial hermann including a tailored one on one employee education program to help them attract and retain the people who are making a difference in their community
1079704 we are pleased to have the opportunity to work with a professional of brett quigleys caliber
1079705 brett is a prominent name in the world of golf and were thrilled to help him manage his career as he continues to flourish on the pga tour
1079706 fsg understands the golf business and has a great team of executives dedicated to helping me excel both on and off the course
1079707 this is an industry where relationships are important and fsg has the network necessary to help me take my career to the next level
1079708 we are proud to have brett quiqley as the newest client in our golf division
1079709 this is a great coming home of sorts for brett having grown up here in new england its exciting anytime we add a great client to the fsg family but knowing that brett has such close roots to this region is extra special
1079710 this acquisition further supports our strategy to expand into new markets and services which we believe complement our core competencies and have strong growth potential we are pleased to respond to market demand by expanding our lines of service to existing and new clients to help them provide high quality anesthesia services for their patients
1079711 we look forward to working with emcare and emsc to expand services in the growing anesthesiology market emscs broad national footprint will afford opportunities to reach new markets across the nation
1079712 rates of infection among african americans and also among hispanics are much higher than among white women sixty four percent of women with hiv are black even though blacks only make up about 13 percent of the u s population
1079713 education plays an important role because hiv is more prevalent in their communities women of color need to know they are more likely to be exposed to hiv
1079714 all women should understand how to protect themselves such as limiting their number of partners and using
1079715 physicians can explain to their patients that hiv screening is recommended for all adults now and that there are numerous benefits to being tested we need to continue to destigmatize hiv screening and make it a part of routine care
1079716 the results of this trial show that telemedicine is efficacious for making acute medical decisions stroke telemedicine is widely implemented and discussed but despite its dissemination its efficacy has not previously been shown our results support the use of telemedicine to make urgent treatment decisions such as whether to use thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke
1079717 we feel the breast ct was superior to traditional mammography for mass lesions but mammography remains superior over breast ct for microcalcifications
1079718 one of the things that is appealing is comfort on the part of the patient
1079719 it has to be just as accurate in finding breast cancer as mammography and should not generate a higher rate of false positives
1079720 it is not a new schedule i think bruce was just stating that the schedule in place is in fact very aggressive we plan to break ground this fall and are working to open in calendar year 2010 while thats the goal if it is not met then it would end up being calendar year 2011
1079721 we have evidence to suggest cr creatine uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
1079722 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a substitute for exercise training
1079723 in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
1079724 mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the longer term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
1079725 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come
1079726 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
1079727 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
1079728 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
1079729 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
1079730 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
1079731 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
1079732 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
1079733 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
1079734 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
1079735 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease
1079736 our study suggests that demyelinated tissues produce signals that can enhance the generation of new neurons in damaged areas of the brain based on our findings there is enough evidence to support the idea that new neurons can re grow in multiple sclerosis lesions
1079737 the basic science discovery may provide the basis for the development for new therapies for ms and other neurodegenerative diseases
1079738 an important therapeutic option for patients especially for patients who have very aggressive ms or whose ms has continued to progress despite treatment with other therapies and the risk benefit ratio of the drug remains favorable
1079739 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
1079740 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
1079741 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
1079742 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
1079743 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
1079744 as we now have developed treatments that are easier to take in terms of number of pills number of doses in the day and potential adverse effects and we now know there seem to be additional benefits with starting earlier the pendulum is swinging back to starting treatment earlier
1079745 also importantly is the recognition of comorbidities that should prompt you to start treatment earlier including
1079746 the take home message is prevention is always better than treatment which seems to be possible through the utilization of the latest diagnostic techniques
1079747 this is the clearest picture weve ever had of new hiv infections occurring in the united states
1079748 we have to do more as individuals communities and a nation to make sure were doing everything we can to stop the further spread of hiv
1079749 the magnitude of new infections is larger than previously thought but we have the same picture of whos at risk
1079750 these new cdc numbers lend credence to what public health officials have long been saying that hiv is alive and well and thriving in certain communities in the u s
1079751 using these advanced methods to paint a more accurate picture of the numbers of new hiv infections is important for working out where our prevention messages have worked and where there is a need for improvement its time to take a precision strike approach towards hiv prevention in this country
1079752 these incidents of pml are unfortunate and disappointing and we hope for the best possible outcomes for these individuals and their families
1079753 however their occurrence is within range of the predicted frequency of cases estimated by a published report and by the fda of approximately one in 1 000 people taking the drug
1079754 worsening neurological symptoms such as any changes in thinking eyesight balance strength and other symptoms
1079755 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
1079756 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
1079757 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
1079758 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of
1079759 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
1079760 i was surprised by how much the risks increased when we excluded people who reported treatment with cpap
1079761 our findings suggest but cannot prove that people diagnosed with sleep apnea should be treated and if cpap is the prescribed treatment regular use may prevent premature death
1079762 a source of funding for the al qaida affiliated asg abu sayyaf group
1079763 founded sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s by muhammad jamal khalifah who is usama bin ladens brother in law and has been identified as a senior al qaida member
1079764 provided donor funds directly to al qaida and is identified as a major fundraiser for the abu sayyaf group asg and jemaah islamiyah ji
1079765 we dont have money for players like darren i dont think we could do a deal like that it would be too much for us we dont have the capacity for a deal of that magnitude
1079766 it is a fitting tribute to the greatest west ham player ever and the decision to retire the bobby moore no6 shirt shows the esteem to which bobby is held at the club
1079767 i can promise we havent received any offer he is enjoying himself in england is one of the best paid players and i dont believe they olympiakos have got the finances for it
1079768 the aim of the group is that we finish this year like the last one on a happy note
1079769 i think well work this week to try to improve and give the coach some hard choices to make the key thing is for us to keep winning and to see the team return to what it was last year
1079770 we won at zaragoza and its important that we did so wed talked before the game about confidence and to build on the things wed done well so far
1079771 commercial marinades offer spices and herbs which have antioxidants that help decrease the hcas formed during grilling

1079777 lindgren is fun to hang with generous loyal and a terrible gambler
1079778 i dont know if its a good investment but it gives everyone a good chance to make the same inroads that i was given a chance to make
1079779 it keeps my friends close and gives me a tremendous sweat whenever they have a lot of chips
1079780 i think the people in the poker media see that i really put in the effort and that ive come really close
1079781 i think its easy to cheer for a guy that tries hard and keeps coming close that and im not normally mean to people im a relatively easy guy to root for because i get along with everybody
1079782 in a world of unique individuals in tournament poker erick is truly special
1079783 his super logical mind sets him apart on the felt and his big heart and charisma attract all who meet him away from the tables
1079784 i think at the time you wrote your sneering piece many commenters pointed out these inaccuracies as they always do whenever one of your pieces appear its good that you have acknowledged these there may well have been letters exchanged between lawyers to get you there i just hope that you have learned something from this the same thing that many of us have been saying for a long time distortions sneering and sarcasm are not proper journalistic techniques

1079799 goes right to an enormous vulnerability that barack has created for himself with his grandiosity
1079800 the questions now becoming who does this guy think he is i think that is the real question
1079801 goes right to an enormous vulnerability that barack has created for himself with his grandiosity
1079802 that real question to be resolved because the issue in this campaign is barack obama
1079803 if he persuades middle america hes the guy he wins so the real question has been who is this guy the questions now becoming who does this guy think he is i think that is the real question
1079804 w ho is he and who the heck does this guy think he is is becoming a real issue for barack obama
1079805 act ing like you know he thinks he is the lords gift to mankind
1079806 i am the messiah i am the one the world has been waiting for
1079807 and it will be remembered as a time that the earth healed itself and the skies
1079808 can you name any prominent republican that has said that obama is not patriotic
1079809 can you name any prominent republican that has brought up that has said that sen barack obama is not patriotic or that hes got a funny name or that he doesnt look like those presidents on dollar bills do you know any prominent republican that has said any of these things
1079810 can you name any prominent republican that has brought up that has said that sen barack obama is not patriotic or that hes got a funny name or that he doesnt look like those presidents on dollar bills do you know any prominent republican that has said any of these things
1079811 republican and conservative websites for more than a year and a half now have been doing that
1079812 i will tell you that if obama is elected president then the radical islamists the al qaida the radical islamists and their supporters will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on september 11 because they will declare victory in this war on terror
1079813 it matters because they read a meaning into that in the rest of the world that has a special meaning to them they will be dancing in the streets because of his middle name they will be dancing in the streets because of who his father was and because of his posture that says pull out of the middle east and pull out of this conflict
1079814 w hy do we wear pins because our country was under attack and to politicize once again the war to this extent well who cares about the war are you proud of your country do you believe in america
1079815 f irst of all at least the president wasnt making a statement and he did have his hand over his heart in the right place alan
1079816 no obama but the difference here is barack obama made a statement about the iraq war with the flag pin and to not do it here people are raising questions about why is this another statement
1079817 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1079818 i am supposed to look like an innocent teenage girl i go to school with him which is really funny
1079819 cameron can be tough and cold and a terminator in one breath and then in the next breath she can be this vulnerable child like character because she is absorbing everything around her for the first time this reality and going back in time and trying to blend into normal society is new for her
1079820 ok why not be in a die hard type of flim have her trapped in a building with terrorists and takes them out one by one would be real cool for summer to play cop kind of like a john mclean type who doesnt follow orders and has some one liners too lol
1079821 we are getting off topic here and no its raptor glare many of us fan have already agreed upon this term
1079822 in the imagining of a post apocalyptic world you do have unfortunately a lot of references that we can go to today
1079823 war torn countries and third world countries where people dont have access to basic clean food and water and necessities and medical provisions and thats something to kind of examine i think for us to say ok yes were making a picture about totally devastating circumstances but the fact that it does reflect things that are going on currently in this privileged world that were living in where there hasnt been an apocalypse and robots havent taken over the world i mean i think thats something definitely for us to re investigate and to continue to make choices for our own future
1079824 for my character because she is a physician you really are trying to just do the best that you can given circumstances and i mean i assume shes just finding books and shes just talking to as many people who have survived at the hospital to learn techniques so she can continue to save lives
1079825 so thats been a really fascinating journey for me personally
1079826 this man is just a gentleman an amazing person i adore him and i just cant wait to be with him next week his character john connor is a very intense character and so misinterpretations could happen but every experience ive had with christian has been like im not worthy to be in your presence i have not had an experience like this before with an actor
1079827 it will be in a similar fashion to the way that batman begins revitalized and reinvented
1079828 i see there is great potential for reinvention and revitalization of the mythology of it and thats what im aiming to do
1079829 thats what i feel like our responsibility is otherwise there is no point in making it
1079830 we dont ignore a mythology similar to what we did with batman
1079831 the character of marcus is compared to a riddick character he is in a coma and wakes up 15 years into the war between the machines and mankind

1079857 though i originally thought zell might be the kick in the ass we needed i cant stand the guy
1079858 but in the long run hes just an accelerator for a downfall that is happening naturally for all his business acumen zell has allowed his executives to concentrate at least publicly on the stuff that needs the least fixing editorial content and design id argue that for now 100 of their effort should be given to increasing sales and readership in print and online
1079859 id stop lee abrams from writing his dumb ass memos that are supposed to inspire tribune workers but only serve to piss everyone off it says something about zells leadership that scores of great journalists many wanting to embrace the future and lead the newspaper have voluntarily walked away from their jobs careers while mr abrams continues to pull down a large salary

1079863 our programming strategy is to try to deliver the best experience on the best platform and by far that is the best way when youre looking at 2 900 hours of live coverage youve got to make some decisions and we need to address the audience and i think we are you also need to consider major advertisers and affiliates and nbcs own investment that all comes to bear on the programming strategy you look at that ideal experience 8 00 p m on saturday night and sunday and monday night the place to be is in your living room and given the time difference the time and place to be monday morning at your desk may be at your laptop what were trying to do is expand this so broadly i think that effort alone is reasonable were taking a big leap from torino of two hours live and upped it 2 000 i think were going to take a deep breath after this and look to the future and think weve done a pretty good job of addressing that when i want it what i want it attitude thats pretty pervasive
1079864 we ve got these passionate passionate taekwondo fans passionate equestrian fans folks who ve grown up playing the sports whose children play them and for whom the olympics is the ultimate expression of their sport despite the fact that we ve been putting it on five cable networks with as much press time as we can we have not been able to serve the audience as effective they want us to
1079865 we ve decided not to do live commentary on every hour of those more than 2 000 live streams because of the costs
1079866 this has been a big initiative with us and with the ioc as well we ve invested a lot in the olympus and as a consequence will work very hard to protect that investment weve worked with the ioc on fingerprint solutions and worked with some of the major ugc distributors including youtube to find a way to identify videos not being put out by nbc
1079867 it will be very quick i cant give you a per second by second analysis but our goal is to catch it before its posted thats the intention there s no such thing as a perfect system in the world of the internet because theres always a place some analog method where someone can post something
1079868 we spent a tremendous time of amount and effort to deliver the olympics and the best experiences we can and we want to make sure we preserve that because that reflects well on the olympics and reflects well on nbc
1079869 we have to deliver what we promise and we have to work hard to preserve the integrity of the brand at the same time this is a seismic shift from one game to another and this hasnt been a long period of time going from 2 hours to more than 2 000 to 3 500 on demand and multiple platform that shows real responsiveness to the market
1079870 web 2 0 is one of those big buzzwords that no one knows what it means if it means that the world is a community and tying that community together we do have a strategy there
1079871 the rights landscape is what it is we are protecting our rights within our territory
1079872 its not necessarily an environment that lends itself to germination of ideas and people sharing clips and being able to form communities over time i mean youre going to be in and out of swimming in eight or nine days so thats why we think the better place for this is in universal sports where you can form that community and lend people the tools to experiment
1079873 you pass it to your friends and the faster you pass you win or if you drop it you get notified i think its a fun application and it helps people connect we find ways for people to connect but ultimately we want people to go to nbcolympics com because we think its the best place to experience these games
1079874 we cant deliver you results for 34 sports and 10 000 athlete bios and breaking news every day in a facebook widget its not complete and so we think the best experience is to come to nbcolympics com as a hub and connect to other places
