6780000 it was great to hear the supporters in such good heart and we all really appreciated the backing
6780001 nothing lifts a player more than hearing the crowd in full voice and that level of support is going to be critical over the coming weeks and months
6780002 there have been a lot of changes behind the scenes over the summer during what has been a transitional period for the club
6780003 things are still settling down but we are totally committed as a unit and the fans are very much a key part of the team here
6780004 de hoy en adelante cuando sus madres digan que les quieren pidan una segunda opini n
6780005 everybody has got their price and the chairman decided that it was a good deal for accrington stanley
6780006 of course i want us to see us keep our best players but at the moment the club is going through difficult times and they need to make ends meet
6780007 thats the way it is sometimes weve just got to get on with it theres other people here more than capable of doing a good job in ians position
6780008 its a big hole to fill but the likes of john mullin and jimmy ryan are pushing for a place in the side
6780009 ian was a good friend of mine and a lot of the rest of the lads
6780010 it wasnt just about what he did on the pitch
6780011 he was such a good character around the club he helped bring a good team spirit
6780012 this happened because i didnt double check the release dates on what i believed to be the latest copy of our development schedule i was looking at an outdated copy
6780013 our vp of development was upset to hear that this happened he has instituted a new communication mechanism whereby any changes in the development schedule will be emailed to everyone in the sales marketing support and professional services organizations with return receipts on those emails which will be tracked in a database
6780014 jim ive already gotten authorization from our vp of development to put your project at the top of the stack as the mistake was ours he also insists that we take on this special project at our cost the good news is that when the standard interface is released in june well be delighted to provide it at no charge since you will have already paid for that capability
6780015 jim ive told you the news and explained the impact and a recommended course of action are there any issues that i may have missed do you have any questions or concerns
6780016 jim id like to know if i can count on you to accept my apology and continue to work with me to keep us moving forward together
6780017 mr gehrys busy schedule and the need to finish the design within a few months a process that included a site change in june
6780018 frank is unable to contribute to this final phase of design frank gehry has said to us im sorry that i have to withdraw but im a great fan of hughs and theater for a new audience is going to have a terrific theater
6780019 i didnt even know they were starting over again i suppose they didnt need two of us
6780020 quest ce s service and technology orientation and emphasis on client service have provided a solid foundation for our tremendous growth
6780021 our continued success relies on our ability to provide products and services that innovate while maintaining the customer service that we are known for weve developed our new headquarters to be both functional and to inspire so we are able to attract and retain the service oriented professionals who are central to our continued success
6780022 a once in a lifetime opportunity for double digit dividends
6780023 when i heard the guy was running for u s congress i was aghast and thats why i agreed to participate
6780024 i think john dicks has taken a different course and i think mr giridhars story shows just that
6780025 obviously theres only one reason theyre bringing this up and thats because theyre desperate this happened two decades ago
6780026 there were many who made investments from the consultation that did fine
6780027 operating within significant constraints which limit its ability to successfully accomplish its goals
6780028 their grade wouldnt be an a or a plus but its definitely passing
6780029 its not a horrible deal but nasa needs to look at these
6780030 research and development is not the only answer to 6 400 job losses but it should be part of the answer
6780031 given the storms northward path i am concerned that flooding in my district will continue as creeks and rivers in my counties swell due to the excessive flow of water from areas north of my district
6780032 the national weather service has categorized this event as historic
6780033 flash flood warnings and impacts to homes businesses and infrastructure have been ongoing for several days
6780034 excessive rainfall has also posed significant problems for sewer and water treatment plants in several of my counties a large number of private water wells have been contaminated due to overflowing septic tanks health inspectors have been deployed to assist local health officials with inspections also the storms sustained force wind and tidal activity have resulted in excessive beach erosion along the eastern coast of my district
6780035 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6780036 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6780037 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6780038 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6780039 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6780040 independent consultants reports that businesses and peak bodies regularly commission demonstrate exactly what those who commissioned them want demonstrated and the media falls for it every time
6780041 rudd thrown an emissions time bomb carbon plan a company killer
6780042 weve seen a procession of businesses and sectors coming forward to whinge about the governments lamentably weak emissions trading scheme the lng producers the miners the power generators
6780043 the bca with its own independent research junk economics argues for more and bigger handouts for businesses
6780044 trade exposed businesses have no capacity to pass on any increased costs in sectors where currency movements can savage bottom lines or hand out massive windfalls were expected to believe that our exporters or import competing industries can pass on not a cent of ets related costs and that ets related costs would swamp all other cost factors in their pricing decisions 2 trade exposed businesses will not be able to adjust their operations to reduce carbon emissions 7 out of the 14 companies considered in the report in response to an ets must reduce operating costs in some way wasnt that the point of having a trading scheme since when did australian businesses become so inflexible and incapable of innovation that they cant do that 3 a seamless capacity for trade exposed industries to relocate to other jurisdictions businesses dont up and flee based on one cost factor particularly if theres no guarantee that the jurisdiction theyre shifting to wont impose a carbon abatement scheme of its own five minutes after theyve built the new cement factory the capacity for carbon leakage is not 100 nor is it 0 its somewhere in between depending on each industry each company and each country
6780045 i am extremely dismayed by john kerrys continued use of our veterans as political props and im calling on him to stop
6780046 these guys deserve to be respected and not find themselves in a tug of war in a political contest
6780047 this right winger must have studied the karl rove playbook long and hard if he thinks its acceptable to insult private first class sean bannon
6780048 no senator cares more personally or has done more for veterans than john kerry jeff beatty owes our veterans an apology if he believes they dont have a right to speak their mind
6780049 i wasnt expecting to go up given our resource constraints
6780050 we pay attention to them primarily because our parents do and some of our perspective students do
6780051 in fairness to the university of florida theyre already doing a darn good job
6780052 i dont want to make too much of it but i think it would be a mistake to ignore
6780053 would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
6780054 that was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6780055 de facto russian because russia is the only country in the world willing to recognize their right to existence western politicians must come to understand the following truth
6780056 the special collections section of the richard j daley library agreed to let me read them but just before i boarded my flight to chicago the top library officials mysteriously intervened to bar access circumstances strongly suggest the likelihood that bill ayers himself may have played a pivotal role in this denial ayers has long taught at uic where the chicago annenberg challenge offices were housed rent free ayers likely arranged for the files of the chicago annenberg challenge to be housed in the uic library and may well have been consulted during my unsuccessful struggle to gain access to the documents
6780057 while the representative from the university i originally corresponded with had been quite friendly and accommodating prior to my june 23 post afterwards my additional requests for further information went unanswered i did not pursue it at the time because i felt i had told a significant part of the story already thanks to the diligent work of dr kurtz however we now know there is much more to know
6780058 132 boxes containing 947 file folders a total of about 70 linear feet of material
6780059 in releasing its green paper the government has invited input into the final design of its carbon pollution reduction scheme cprs the bca fully supports adopting a comprehensive emissions trading scheme as the best way to reduce emissions but getting the design detail right is critical
6780060 the green paper puts australia on a path to addressing climate change challenges through a partnership between business government and the community but the scheme must send the right signals to businesses
6780061 dont fall so in love with the prose that you lose sight of the story
6780062 in the thriller thats essential absolutely essential which isnt to say that thrillers cant be well written but if you are so in love with your prose that youre willing to sacrifice your story youre not going to be very successful no matter what youre doing whether its a thriller or literary fiction
6780063 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6780064 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house

6780079 when you come into an organization you bring with you an arcane potency which stems in part from your uniqueness
6780080 it was particularly important to explain the role of a social worker for some people coming into the hospice because theyd either had a bad experience with a social worker or they had learnt from the media what one did
6780081 when you are working as part of a team with people from different professions it is important that those prejudices dont get in the way but i would say that was more from the public than the professionals
6780082 the main guidance and support i received was when i joined the association of palliative care social workers a national membership organisation for social workers working in hospice or palliative care settings
6780083 we also had a welfare rights officer if there were particular issues concerning entitlements
6780084 where youre the only social worker in a hospice its invaluable to be able to meet up regionally three or four times a year attend an annual training workshop and have access to e mail and phone contacts
6780085 across the board social workers are increasingly working in a more isolated way
6780086 theyre part of multi disciplinary teams theyre now working in childrens services in a different way in schools in mental health services it is a healthy development in some ways but it is possible that their values can become marginalised by a more powerful group who are much more motivated by self interest than social workers
6780087 within the criminal justice system we would want to respect peoples dignity individuality and rights of course the system may mitigate against that theres an obsession with punishment but often criminal behaviour is at least in part an indication of abuse or need for help
6780088 if you want to gain the confidence of people and tackle antisocial behaviour you need to be seen at times as not part of the system
6780089 if youre part of the punishment regime its not helpful when youre trying to help people to address their behaviour and feel secure enough to share things with you
6780090 if youre all working to different codes of conduct that can lead to difficulties
6780091 you may find in care trusts for example some of the people in the team will be nhs employees and others will be seconded in from the local authority and so you will be working alongside colleagues who are covered by different disciplinary procedures
6780092 if you have specific professional concerns it can be a problem if you dont have someone at the next desk you can share that with and talk things over
6780093 there are strengths you talk to some social workers in those settings and they say the way in which they interact with their colleagues adds a lot to their understanding of the situations they face
6780094 where joint teams with health can carry few social workers compared with community psychiatric nurses and particularly where the manager is not a social worker and unused to or unaware of supervision
6780095 supervision is the key to support for any social worker and more so where there is no direct professional support
6780096 there has to be more support guidance in place and an opportunity to access experienced supervision where professional or practice issues arise upon which the social worker needs direction and help
6780097 i was the sole social worker in a team made up of nurses doctors nursing auxiliaries and volunteers
6780098 my focus was providing social work services to patients and their families and carers and setting up and co ordinating a bereavement service a lot of the work involved talking to people using counselling skills and helping them to adapt to the situation they were in
6780099 it was very important that we were all aware of our individual roles and responsibilities
6780100 in palliative care particularly there is potential for crossover because staff do have more time to spend with people than they perhaps would on a hospital ward or in a gp surgery a nurse might pick up on something that wasnt part of their remit
6780101 one of the things you had to be aware of was peoples expectations of you sometimes people would relate to a certain member of staff and then want that person to do everything for them
6780102 it was particularly important to explain the role of a social worker for some people coming into the hospice because theyd either had a bad experience with a social worker or they had learnt from the media what one did
6780103 when you are working as part of a team with people from different professions it is important that those prejudices dont get in the way but i would say that was more from the public than the professionals
6780104 the main guidance and support i received was when i joined the association of palliative care social workers a national membership organisation for social workers working in hospice or palliative care settings

6780107 the russian elites fear is entirely doctrinal which is to say imaginary russias situation is not in fact like israels no foreign power since the end of the cold war has entertained a plan of attacking russia or destroying russias power and wealth the russian fear rests merely on a somewhat paranoid interpretation of world events fears based on paranoid interpretations cannot be assuaged why do the russians indulge such an interpretation it is an archaism
6780108 benni mccarthy is a very important member of our squad and thats how paul ince sees it
6780109 our position has not changed he is not for sale
6780110 we have a very strong squad with competition in most areas but weve only had one great result there are 37 more games to come
6780111 its a long season and we need a good squad to cope with that
6780112 we are only looking at ways to improve the squad we are not looking to sell
6780113 theyre not really happy times for me but its still all right
6780114 its frustrating if you work hard especially with all the rumours going on and then you dont play
6780115 sunderlands interest is very much for real and im looking to see in the next week whats going to happen because im 31 in november so sitting on the bench or not playing is not an option for me
6780116 if i cant make the starting line up at blackburn then im wasting time
6780117 he doesnt want me to go he wants me to stay and from my point of view i respect the manager
6780118 i cant have any complaints jason was awesome at everton and i cant see the reason why he should be taken out of the starting line up and obviously roques fantastic as well scoring goals
6780119 those two deserve to play but if i cant get in the team then yes i would want the move to sunderland

6780126 he needs to illustrate his complete narrative and tell his personal story as americas story so that when he speaks about values responsibility hard work and opportunity they are his values and americas values
6780127 then people will see that the struggles they are facing are the struggles hes faced

6780132 selbst die us notenbank hat in der vergangenen woche darauf hingewiesen dass die verwerfungen am us hypothekenmarkt die nun auch den kreditkartenmarkt negativ beeinflussten viele mittelgro e banken in schwierigkeiten br chten kommt es tats chlich in den n chsten wochen zu neuen insolvenzen gr eren ausma es bei den us banken sind neue schockwellen an den aktienm rkten fast sicher davon werden dann die anleihem rkte profitieren
6780133 steuerliche anreize und sicherheit stehen bei den investoren weiterhin an erster stelle zudem finden die privatanleger das lange ende noch nicht attraktiv genug f r ein langfristiges engagement bundesanleihen und pfandbriefe werden weiter bevorzugt
6780134 die aktuelle marktlage ist f r ein solches produkt wie geschaffen die m glichkeit auf kurzfristige marktver nderungen flexibel reagieren zu k nnen verst rkt das interesse f r diesen etf
6780135 emittenten und anleger bewerten die risiken im markt realistisch schwellenl nderanleihen die sich durch eine erstklassige bonit t und attraktive konditionen auszeichnen sind nach wie vor gefragt allerdings bleibt das umsatzvolumen der jahreszeit angemessen d nn

6780141 the dpi is so short staffed and their budgets have been cut so much they had to bring a vet from maryborough to test horses this time
6780142 our politics have become so embedded and so partisan with so many special interests that they require a massive effort from the public telling them we want something done
6780143 the prospects of being born in the united states are still better than being born anyplace else in the world
6780144 it has not paid to sell america short since 1776 and the time to start is not in 2008
6780145 what we have to do is to recognize and reward elected officials democrats republicans independents whatever who tell the truth and who stand up and try to help make tough choices sooner rather than later to make sure that americas future is better than its past and reject the b s and the nothing types of solutions and platitudes that we hear from so many politicians today

6780149 i was surrounded by powerhouse actors like paresh rawal kaykay menon irrfan madhavan i was the least experienced of the lot and i was apprehensive
6780150 my job brings me into daily contact with the media and i watch the news closely recently when we had 23 bomb attacks in 24 hours i watched the full coverage theres too much of desensitized lurid sensational coverage on television i play one of those hard nosed trp driven journalists i play a journalist who forgets that during those times the people being interviewed are human then i undergo a crisis and change
6780151 i constantly kind of pull from the experience of where i was at like right before the show i think at that time i was in the top 50 but i wasnt really sure what was gonna happen and i couldnt really make any other steps in my life like i couldnt go get a full time job or something and so i was playing acoustic gigs
6780152 i think the week i moved out to l a for the show i had like 30 bucks to my name so that particular vibe is something i always try to keep hold of now that money has become less of an issue
6780153 in the short time that i was in tulsa i feel tulsas just as much responsible for where im at musically as kansas city is i mean i found myself as a musician in kansas city and i found myself as a person really in tulsa cause that was my first foray into kind of being self sufficient
6780154 the crowds are a little bigger and you just have more resources available to you but i dont know part of me actually kind of misses playing the gray snail saloon in tulsa on a wednesday night
6780155 it hits in pockets you know youll wake up in a hotel and realize ok i couldnt have afforded this new hotel a year ago but i mean its small things i think that really kind of drive it home i got my first bill the other day and that was oh that threw me out of fantasyland for a minute
6780156 if anything im homeless for the first time in my life so i havent really made any firm decisions on where i want to end up i mean ive got family and friends in kansas city ive got friends in tulsa you know well cross that bridge when we get to it
6780157 were writing as were recording and i actually think were like seven or eight songs into the tracking process were going to track out about 20 songs and narrow it down from there for the record but yeah were actually ahead of schedule right now knock on wood
6780158 im writing wherever im at meeting with a lot of people for co writes a lot of the tracking is being done in l a but vocals on the records until i get off the road are probably gonna be done wherever im at
6780159 i want it to be interesting i dont want a listener to feel they can just skip a song so in that regard i want to make a record record i want this to be an album that has a flow to it and every song has a purpose whether its a single or not
6780160 i really hope that people come out to the show and i hope that people really understand that i do have a very big place in my heart for tulsa i mean its probably one of the most integral aspects of who i am today so you know hopefully its the first of many shows to come
6780161 i can never have freedom until i have wiped out all religion and freedom of speech

6780191 the goal is if the company does better the executive does better its purely a way to tie someones compensation to the results
6780192 the fair market value of companies in the d c area has gone down this year ultimately their realizable compensation will be down
6780193 three or four years prior to this year most companies had fantastic performance and realizable pay was higher than opportunity pay i think that will be the opposite this year and into other years
6780194 our knowledge regarding what happens to the body with age is really changing
6780195 it used to be that the gold standard for physical performance was 20 but now you have people who are continuing to train and are pushing the age curve up
6780196 i liken it to a pianist who has done very deliberate practice for 50 years that individual will know exactly what is needed to perform the piece
6780197 the older athlete is aware of how his or her body has changed with age and will anticipate what is needed to perform
6780198 we are learning that exercise actually reverses some basic aspects of aging at the molecular level
6780199 exercise doesnt just make muscles stronger it makes muscles younger
6780200 our goal is to be able to take a biopsy from the quadriceps muscle from someone who is 50 for example and to know whether the person has the muscle of someone younger or older
6780201 we had legitimate questions at the beginning of our research
6780202 was running on hard surfaces going to cause the knees to age prematurely and would the body in general fall apart from too much abuse and overtake any health benefits that occur in the short term
6780203 there is increased importance placed on the role of recovery on giving a body rest
6780204 older athletes should not train seven days a week if youre 40 you can perform like youre 25 but you cant train like youre 25
6780205 a lot of exercise being done now comes from exercises once done for rehabilitation after an injury
6780206 ten years ago core training that focuses on strengthening the torso didnt exist pilates yoga bridges on the floor stability balls
6780207 michael phelps knew which days he would need to be at his absolute best
6780208 so his trainers created a routine working back from his competition date
6780209 at the games in italy youd see all of these wiry gray haired people in their warm ups running and jumping
6780210 you see how active they are running does retard the aging process and thats no small thing
6780211 what so im burning garbage on a city sidewalk what
6780212 our goal is always to deliver sports to fans across any platform and this is yet another agreement that fulfills that strategy
6780213 bring our game to our fans in a variety of new and exciting ways
6780214 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6780215 we are aware of the log on problems but we have no comment at the moment
6780216 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6780217 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
6780218 as gas prices keep going up more and more people are climbing on the bus
6780219 costs look pretty good compared to natural gas power public policy climate concern and new technology are driving it too
6780220 you could supply the entire us with the sun power here in a little piece of the southwest
6780221 if america doesnt do this if we dont install many more of these clean solar power systems well just end up seeing a lot more fossil fuel plants instead
6780222 whats different now from the 80s and 90s is that we have much higher natural gas prices than back then
6780223 i dont think people foresee a serious drop in natural gas prices now even if they fell 30 percent csp would look attractive
6780224 arizona public service really does want to put this solar thermal plant in because in the future this really could replace natural gas
6780225 theyre the first to say that once this plant is installed the fuel is free
6780226 what were seeing with all these companies lining up for solar thermal is hugely promising
6780227 but without the itc all of these solar thermal plants will be put on hold
6780228 return to your home and recount the story of how many and great things god has done for you
6780229 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
6780230 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas

6780238 i would have been happy with a boy as well but i just like girls
6780239 i really thought the shettles method was just worth a shot if it worked cool if not well that would be okay too
6780240 my ob gyn said i got lucky but it wasnt luck the whole thing about polarity made sense to me
6780241 hes a very manly man and wants a boy to do guy stuff with
6780242 i think it is a combo of every method and wives tale out there of how to conceive a boy
6780243 not that i wouldnt have been happy with a boy
6780244 for a high percentage of women when theyre growing up they have a lot of thoughts about parenting and what theyre going to be like the baby they see in that image often of a little girl this baby this image in their mind lives in their subconscious just like a human child
6780245 when you have to let go of that image that dream it is a mourning process
6780246 most of the women who come to me this is their third or fourth pregnancy and for them this is it
6780247 i explain to them that theres a 50 50 change theyll get the gender they want for free but they want to have one more pregnancy and thats it
6780248 in any pregnancy only one in a billion sperm survives to make a baby anyway so ethically we found no harm in discarding unwanted sperm
6780249 each human life begins with fertilization cloning or its functional equivalent at which time every human has all legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood
6780250 that kind of bad connotation of using these treatments for gender selection purposes affects access to fertility treatment as a whole as an unintended consequence
6780251 i dont think the ethics and social implications have caught up with the science
6780252 i can understand if parents already have a child of one gender why they might want a child of the other gender
6780253 however gender does not determine personality or parent child connection so parents who put a great deal of store in expectations about gender may turn out to be disappointed
6780254 disappointment could add to post partum depression and interfere with bonding
6780255 it really depends on the emotional maturity of the parent but this kind of trying to control the babys gender rather than just being glad its a healthy baby indicates some lack of emotional maturity anyway
6780256 should a childs gender be selected like a brand of flour off the grocery store shelf
6780257 when i say wanted i was hyper focused on it all i could think about were the pink aisles at target and the cute dresses i wanted a mother daughter relationship to share same sex experiences and milestones with wanted it so bad i already had a girl name picked out and nursery themes in mind
6780258 to pick the sex of a child is just too designer baby for me whats next eye color and height
6780259 messing with nature to guarantee your childs sex is as selfish as it gets in my book
6780260 if your childs sex means that much to you adopt
6780261 not only can gender be selected but hair and eye color interests etc
6780262 to me knowing there are 1 500 kids in pennsylvania up for adoption and 100 000 nationwide and people dont even consider that option instead spending thousands on gender selection or fertility treatments for a custom baby is really sad
6780263 id hate to be stuck with a girl since im a tomboy and not girly at all
6780264 this is an important litmus test of whether people believe in reproductive freedom or not
6780265 i think people should be able to choose for themselves theyre the ones who have to live with the consequences of accessing this technology or not accessing this technology
6780266 the criticism has been that im playing god but its not like im picking characteristics hair color eye color personality i didnt have to leave gender to chance
6780267 theres loads of research that says that early childhood is a critical time in development yet we dont value the people that work with that age group
6780268 but i think having males enter the field would help that as things are now men dont want to be teachers because they dont want to be poor
6780269 we pay our mechanics more to work on our cars than we pay people to watch our kids which tells you something about our values
6780270 as long as we as society continue to perpetuate the narrative that being nurturing to children is inherently a gendered process well never have gender equity
6780271 males bring something different to the table than females do
6780272 female preschool teachers tend to value calm play and emphasize the importance of social development while male preschool teachers accentuate the significance of physical development
6780273 its amazing to me when theres a male the children fall all over him when you have a young man theyre drawn to him theyre starving for it
6780274 in general we have a family policy against leaving our children alone with men
6780275 background checks give me very little reassurance theres always a first offense and small children are easy prey the stigma about male childcare workers is not just a stigma its a statistic a child is nearly nineteen times more likely to be molested by a male than by a female we find it easier to make a blanket policy and weed out 95 of our chances for problems
6780276 if parents want to avoid male caregivers thats their right but collectively it creates an enormous stigma and stereotype that is unwarranted and has significant ramifications for our larger cultural narrative
6780277 i can appreciate the strong sentiment of being protective of ones child but to some extent our perceptions of the risk have been distorted by the media yes there are pedophiles and one needs to be attentive but the risk of ones child being abused is distorted by the medias repetitive presentation of these kinds of cases running them over and over again until males are tainted with this blanket brush as being very dangerous
6780278 when my sweet boy is a teenager i will not let him baby sit for other peoples children for his own protection an accusation even one that is later proven false could be life destroying
6780279 when we have men in our program im more protective of them because you know mcmartin
6780280 theres a real bias that it couldnt be natural for a man to be interested in young children or that any man interested in children is a pervert we need to change that stereotype just like if a little girl might want to be a firefighter and thats not typical but we have to encourage her
6780281 developing those skills is something that transcends the family it extends to the public domain
6780282 i tell them that they need to find another place to put their children
6780283 we believe that all of our teachers are respectful to children and we do not discriminate on the basis of gender just as we dont discriminate against someone who black or someone in a wheelchair
6780284 if im accused of being sexist i dont particularly care if it means that the odds are higher that my kids are safe
6780285 i dont care being accused of sexism or paranoia better safe than sorry
6780286 i will not sacrifice my children on the altar of political correctness
6780287 when you have gender equity in the larger society with both men and women invested in childrens lives children will benefit more than they would if only half the population has a strong commitment to them
6780288 its important for children to see men nurturing children in public settings those lessons in the context of a public setting can be very powerful
6780289 if they feel that a wider diversity of people are looking out for their best interests but if you only have half the population focused on kids kids have fewer opportunities if males who want to become involved with children are looked at askance then males will be less likely to want to spend time with kids then society overall will suffer from that
6780290 she isnt supposed to be a real woman mommy she isnt a woman at all shes just a barbie
6780291 no other dichotomy in human experience appears to have as many entities linked to it as does the distinction between female and male
6780292 curriculum based on state standards should be taught in the classroom if teachers cover subject matter required by the standards and teach it well then students will master the material on which they will be tested and probably much more in that case students will need no special test preparation in order to do well
6780293 and theyre worried about whether i have the right testing sections written on the board
6780294 see we must challenge a system that simply shuffles children through grade to grade without determining whether they can read write and add and subtract its a system see i like to call it this we need to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations
6780295 weve got kids who arent thinking about homework or test preparation theyre worried about finding food
6780296 this kids single mother with eight children works three jobs just to pay rent and try to provide for her kids she doesnt have time to oversee his homework much less his education there are many parents who are simply not going to go through all the paperwork required by no child left behind and arent able to give the required volunteer time to get their children into a charter school
6780297 the schools now have even less incentive to develop high performing students skills so the top students need to go elsewhere for their education thats good for my company to be sure but not so good for the future of science technology medicine and anything else in this country that requires top minds
6780298 one unintended effect of the no child left behind act which is intended to help fund teaching of science and math to young people is that it has effectively squeezed out civics education because there is no testing for that anymore and no funding for that
6780299 and at least half of the states no longer make the teaching of civics and government a requirement for high school graduation this leaves a huge gap and we cant forget that the primary purpose of public schools in america has always been to help produce citizens who have the knowledge and the skills and the values to sustain our republic as a nation our democratic form of government
6780300 join us in trying to improve education in america rather than apparently being resistant to change
6780301 i believe that the goals of this law were the right ones making a promise to educate every child with an excellent teacher is right closing the achievement gap that exists in too many cities and rural areas is right more accountability is right higher standards are right labeling a school and its students as failures one day and then throwing your hands up and walking away from them the next is wrong
6780302 the nsg should reject this ill considered unwise and unproductive plan
6780303 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power

6780398 in retrospect there are a million reasons why i shouldnt have done it
6780399 i was a boxer but id never hit anybody out of the ring we were closing out the evening with that cover always seems to start something in the audience i get to the first chorus and this guy comes over pushes me away from the mic takes it and starts singing me and bassist alex look at each other and we go on playing the second chorus comes and the guy does it again but this time he spills beer on my guitar now im starting to do a small burn i cant wait for the set to be over so i can get in the guys face and talk to him i didnt have to wait he came over a third time this time he came over and i decked him
6780400 there are a lot of talented musicians out there that dont know how to market themselves today its even tougher than in my first go round in the business back then there was only one way to make it a record label signed you there was no internet no indy labels in college wed play all year go into a studio cut a demo and walk around wed hang the letters on our dorm walls and it looked very cool because we had gotten rejected from rejected from rca rejected from columbia but that was how it went down today you have to know how youre going to market yourself are you just going to throw your songs on a website and expect people to find you and hire you or buy your cd theyre not going to do that you have to figure out what the spin is going to be you and i wouldnt be sitting here talking today if we didnt come up with a spin on edmonton its why im here today
6780401 we came up with the idea to send edmonton to all of the radio stations up there and it got the radio play if we hadnt have come up with the spin on how to market edmonton nothing would have ever happened i would not be playing music full time or even at all
6780402 everybody knows the story of how so and so walked into the bar heard you play and signed you that doesnt happen anymore because the labels dont even have the freedom to sign people like they used to in the old days youve got to figure out what to do to get attention when i wrote st patricks day my promotions guy said lets not release it until st patricks day we knew that on st patricks day the stations would play a song like that it broke on 58 stations and even in the uk on the new album i wrote a song about gay marriage dedicated to my kid brother who died 20 years ago from aids i thought it was really cool that gay people can now get married i wrote a song called love won out so were going to market that song to the gay community im not going to market it to the straight community maybe they dont give a shit
6780403 theres not a book that you can read on this like get publicity for your cd 101 but you look at what you have and what the possible angles could be at the very least you want to get it reviewed stay on top of people and thats where the day job part gets really tough i play at night but spend my days marketing im sending emails calling places setting up tours and getting people to write if you dont have that ability but youre going into the studio to record then you should have the money in your budget for a publicist if you dont then youre spinning your wheels thats the key thing how are you going to get people to your there may be a lot of artists that think its not righteous to do things that way but the hype is part of it i exploited edmonton as far as i could possibly take it and it changed my life i mean my life has totally changed

6780487 disease can influence different behaviours including foraging mate choice and predator avoidance several recent papers have shown reduced learning abilities in infected insects however it is difficult to separate the effects of the immune response from the direct effects of the parasite that was the purpose of our study
6780488 this work has two important applications firstly there is a lot of interest in the connections between the immune system and the nervous system in human biology the mallon lab was the first to show that these interactions also exist in the much more experimentally tractable insects
6780489 secondly there is concern about both the decline in wild bumble bee species and the effects of disease on the honeybee industry it has been shown that learning is vitally important to how well a colony prospers this effect of immunity on learning highlights a previously unconsidered effect of disease on colony success

6780494 congratulations to my team mate on his deserved first grand prix victory it was nowhere near as bad as it could have been as we could have had kimi and felipe ahead of us the race could have been better for me my start was ok but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me my lap times were good and i kept the gap slightly small with our strategy we still had the chance to pass him but the damaged tyre destroyed my race i dont know why it happened but at least i scored some points so the result was not too bad for me
6780495 it is just unbelievable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash i could not believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was second i was under pressure from kimi with soft tyres and i was struggling quite a lot we knew since friday that the soft tyres would be difficult i had a really good car it was perfect until the last stint unbelievable in my first year

6780545 een centrale regie over en visie op de programmering op de verschillende podia
6780546 het krijgen van subsidie is een soort van erkenning maar voor die erkenning is ook herkenning nodig dat lukt niet altijd even goed ze begrijpen het vaak toch niet helemaal
6780547 een paar maanden geleden zag ik het heel somber in ik wilde onderdeel worden van de zogenaamde basisinfrastructuur en direct structurele steun van de overheid krijgen net als noorderslag ik werd doorverwezen naar het fonds dat ik nu alsnog gedeeltelijk erkenning krijg stemt me blij

6780581 im ersten training konzentrierten wir uns darauf uns an die strecke heranzutasten
6780582 der asphalt war noch sehr schmutzig am morgen es dauerte bis die strecke einigerma en guten grip bot die bedingungen w hrend der zweiten session waren besser obwohl es immer noch recht rutschig war
6780583 wir haben die beiden reifenmischungen verglichen und an der abstimmung gearbeitet die streckenbedingungen waren jedoch nie f r eine halbe stunde konstant deshalb ist es schwer prognosen f r morgen anzustellen wir m ssen nun die daten analysieren
6780584 der neue kurs hier in valencia gef llt mir sehr gut die streckenf hrung ist gelungen
6780585 anfangs war die strecke nat rlich noch extrem verschmutzt aber die bedingungen sind schlie lich f r alle gleich bei uns gab es keinerlei technischen schwierigkeiten und ich konnte den reifenvergleich wie geplant fahren mit den rundenzeiten bin ich allerdings noch nicht zufrieden wir werden jetzt in ruhe alle daten analysieren und herausfinden was wir verbessern k nnen
6780586 obwohl wir hier auf einer neuen strecke fahren gab es keine berraschungen in bezug auf die abstimmung der autos die strecke ist so wie wir sie erwartet hatten wie immer am freitag haben wir den reifenvergleich erledigt und uns auf die rennvorbereitung konzentriert weil es auf diesem neuen parcours keine referenzwerte gibt werden wir nun alle daten analysieren und dabei im besonderen die sektorzeiten vergleichen um die richtigen schl sse f r die abstimmung zu ziehen

6780593 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces

6780742 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and that the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that every year attract an average of 130 million people
6780743 research clearly indicates that lowering the drinking age will not lead to decreases in alcohol use and abuse rates but it will almost certainly normalize alcohol use among youth and exacerbate problems that already exist

6780828 there has been surprisingly little published research addressing alcohol use sales or problems at professional sport stadiums in the u s
6780829 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that attract an average of 130 million people each year
6780830 we know already that theres a link between alcohol use and problem behaviors among fans but theres more that sports stadiums can do to prevent sales to people who are clearly drunk
6780831 if people are intoxicated we dont need them to consume more alcohol
6780832 combining thousands of fans with significant alcohol sales could be construed as a recipe for some serious problems like increased instances of violence and drunk driving
6780833 given the results of this study stadium management and local and state elected officials may want to consider banning or restricting alcohol sales in the stands at sporting events as some stadiums have already done

6781109 i guess somebody returned one of the ones they stole weve only had the program up for a few days but weve lost a lot of flags
6781110 the crosswalks have been adopted by area businesses and residents and we have been able to collect license plate numbers of cars involved in the act and will report anyone or any vehicle seen stealing flags to the police
6781111 thats extremely frustrating especially because this truly is a community venture
6781112 but if the flags keep on disappearing theres a certain point where we just wont be able to do it
6781113 but the thing to me is youre hundreds of metres away and you see these things on the crosswalk theyve done what the lime green signs would have done

6781115 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next

6781122 instead of so much space between houses we have water and sewer introduced and now some people can reach out and touch their neighbour
6781123 there are tall skinny little houses going up that dont fit the subdivision they dont fit the lots that we all have
6781124 when you have contractors coming in doing what they want to do theres no care or thought going into it
6781125 if one piece of land goes up the contractors are flocking we arent that far out from the city and were on municipal water and sewer
6781126 its not millwood we dont want to be a millwood we love our squirrels
6781127 people have the right to do whats within the laws and boundaries within hrm planning its their land they bought it
6781128 if the land can sustain it and the roadways and schools can manage it we cant stop it its their neighbours selling the lots you cant take their rights away
6781129 i completely understand and appreciate their concern but you cant take a small part of a community in the whole of hrm and say youre going to be special and have different rules
6781130 the municipal planning strategy applies to everyone in hrm and you cant have special allowances for residents in this little pocket and that little pocket
6781131 who would ever have thought me coming from ballarat doing this when i first started off race walking i was hopeless i walked 21 minutes for three kilometres i reckon street walkers get out and walk faster than i first did i just cant believe it ive worked so hard for this ive had so much support
6781132 i worried that id get to 20k and go oh jeez the 20k last week is really starting to hurt but lucky it didnt happen today
6781133 today i was on the warm up track and just looking up at the flame i thought this is just what it is all for all those years of hard work are just here for this i really just decided to give it a crack go with the leaders and see what happens im ecstatic i cant believe it
6781134 when they both got away i thought oh no not another bronze
6781135 i just sort of sat there and a few tears rolled down my face
6781136 it just happened so quick and in the race that can change your life
6781137 i had a bit of a scream back when i got up and noticed that my back wheel was taco ed that was the end of my lap there
6781138 to have someone else ruin my race for me thats the most disappointing thing i dont know what to think right now im a bit down on it all really
6781139 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6781140 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6781141 i think there is a mental strength about this group
6781142 i think it is the last opportunity for some of these players to be together as a group i think that will mean a lot
6781143 to go away with nothing would be gut wrenching its gut wrenching enough to lose the opportunity we lost tonight but we cant lose the next opportunity and im confident and i trust in this group to be able to regroup
6781144 the spanish were too good for us look at the stats they got at us more than we got at them for us over the last four years we had some pretty good semi finals and finals and its probably the first time weve missed out on a final for a long time

6781156 if we achieved anything through the process the councillors have heard loud and clear that residents dont want a tall building on the bayers road site
6781157 coun murphy added wording to the development agreement that ensures scale height and massing of the building will be taken into consideration he has listened to his constituents in that regard
6781158 i think we were fighting an army well oiled and well heeled developer and his associates who will bring money to the council coffers versus the few residents of the area who spoke against the project
6781159 council were swayed by the bigger louder voice not by the very real concerns of the neighbourhood unfortunately it is difficult to get a neighbourhood mobilized to speak against a project especially after the chebucto road fiasco
6781160 the process was flawed from day one when the land was declared surplus unknown to those on whom it would have most impact
6781161 why werent we consulted this was a very sinful oversight on the part of the councillors supposedly representing our best interest too many people with vested interests have swayed the council to say yes to them money not only talks it sings dances and does handstands
6781162 i mentioned this to the mayor and councillors at our meeting on aug 12 hoping to spark some plans for 2009 in the various districts of hrm already there are several in the spryfield area and one near st patrick alexandra school
6781163 recently a large number of developments have been approved for the downtown area not necessarily because the four councillors have been in favour of them but because they have been outvoted by the other 18 councillors who love to concrete the downtown area but who can go home in the evenings and look out over the lake while those of us in the city choke on their exhaust fumes
6781164 the bayers road neighbourhood committee favours four storey buildings over anything higher
6781165 at this stage i have spoken to the developer and offered to work together for a proposal that meets his needs and the communitys our committee will continue to work with the developer hrm planning and peninsula councillors to ensure something appropriate is built on the site
6781166 if something is to be built here i want to have a say in it
6781167 it must be low level not more than four storey and must fit in the neighbourhood i will go blind if i have to look at big and ugly every time i go to bayers road
6781168 the material they use to do the roof will be different from what youd typically see
6781169 the other thing is this building was built long before strict building codes the beams are pretty far apart so they will have to be pretty careful
6781170 putting up cedar shingles is not done typically unless its a heritage house or belongs to someone who has money
6781171 at the same time contractors are going to be doing the gutters because we have very carefully crafted wooden gutters
6781172 its impossible for our volunteers to keep them painted and functioning properly
6781173 there are still trees that could land on top of the manor but weve been very careful about pruning and removing
6781174 why families were very interested in providing a healthier lifestyle for people taking the kids away from the computers and away from the televisions
6781175 this helps families get together to learn different skills like how to make a fire how to cook outdoors and what things to try to cook because you arent working with a fully functional kitchen well also do map and compass reading gps hiking survival basics and even how to pitch a tent
6781176 if you are a single person youre a family single moms with children and couples without kids are still a family
6781177 the bottom line objective is to get people comfortable with being in the outdoors and to get them out there more often

6781184 weve definitely lost 20 of the population this year and probably more

6781258 seems to be caught in one of a series of repeating cycles in which diversity all but disappears from the small screen
6781259 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
6781260 seems to be caught in one of a series of repeating cycles in which diversity all but disappears from the small screen
6781261 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6781262 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6781284 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6781285 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6781286 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6781287 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6781288 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6781289 you know there are some things that even i dont know and what michelle is going to wear is a tightly held secret more tightly held than who my vice presidential choice is going to be
6781290 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6781291 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided
6781292 its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6781293 with financial conditions already quite fragile the sudden unanticipated failure of bear stearns would have led to a sharp unwinding of positions in those markets that could have severely shaken the confidence of market participants
6781294 the broader economy could hardly have remained immune from such severe financial disruptions

6781302 deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6781303 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels

6781328 there is a tidal wave of new capital projects around the globe which has put immense pressure on delivery times and has caused construction costs to skyrocket in addition brownfield operations have to contend with limited resources for proper maintenance of their assets in both cases lack of care in managing asset information the virtual asset leads to poor performance of physical and human assets
6781329 the current costs of poor asset information management are staggering throughout the asset lifecycle the performance of large scale capital projects and operating facilities are all hindered for example collaboration across global design and build teams handover of information to owner operators for better operations and maintenance management of change and information quality safety and compliance and the general ability to deliver the right information to the right people at the right time are all compromised better aim is a prerequisite not a nice to have to deal with the need to manage assets in a safe effective and efficient manner across the entire asset lifecycle the time to act is now
6781330 ultimately the lack of complete accurate and timely asset information leads to delays budget overruns poor reliability low productivity and supply chain inefficiencies
6781331 in todays business environment this can be the difference between business success and failure businesses need to invest in specific technologies to improve their operations for instance companies implementing an effective aim solution such as nrx asset center are able to improve quality and efficiency and dramatically reduce the risk of scheduling delays and cost overruns sap and nrx are working closely with our customers to tackle these challenges this ensures that the facilities can perform the way that the business expects
6781332 if users have to access multiple systems to do their jobs too much energy is drained and roi is diminished as solution providers we have to provide users with a seamless experience
6781333 the ability to merge content and data in a common workflow is a powerful business process enabler open text and nrx are working together to enable critical processes such as management of change moc and deliver a compelling experience to a broad spectrum of shop floor users
6781334 asset integrity is mission critical and accurate asset information is essential to the assurance of asset integrity this information which includes asset equipment hierarchies functional locations tags maintenance task lists maintenance plans and bills of materials must be sustained for the life of all assets
6781335 owner operators face many challenges in managing asset information data handover from engineering partners and oem suppliers often falls short where oem amp epc data formats and levels of detail differ from owner operator requirements for plant operations maintenance aim solutions such as nrx asset center support the operations readiness team by enabling automation of manual processes including loading of asset master data into the maintenance management system sap pm in our case in addition the operations maintenance team must review and assure the quality of critical asset information periodically throughout the life of every asset to sustain asset integrity solutions such as nrx provide support to such reviews enabling rigorous management of sap pm master data changes
6781336 large capital projects are faced with many challenges including distributed execution and labor shortages bechtels information management goal is to provide a project services network to the distributed team members and joint venture partners around the globe using only an internet connection and a browser
6781337 owner operators are demanding project information as a continuous deliverable in the capital project cycle the dump truck paradigm of handing over information at the end of the project is no longer acceptable
6781338 we have to provide a high quality flow of information from the beginning our project services network is leveraging solutions such as nrx asset center to serve as the project data hub which allows us to define better requirements collaborate with our suppliers and provide real time handover of information to our customers
6781339 from prior experience we have learned that aim solutions are essential enablers of user adoption and business process compliance
6781340 to ensure achievement of these factors we co developed business processes with over 100 people globally and built cross functional teams that spanned all units we are supporting these new processes by leveraging user friendly nrx solutions and end user knowledge and feedback throughout the projects
6781341 without the proper processes tools and controls in place from day one of go live data quality can quickly become an issue for example whether in big bang or incremental projects companies should start data collection and clean up prior to go live so their asset and document management systems are populated with comprehensive and accurate data and documents aim solutions reduce the time and cost incurred searching for and managing asset information and benefits are magnified if aim solutions are applied across all plants and business units
6781342 industry leaders are increasingly recognizing aim as an extremely important enabler of capital project delivery and asset performance this annual forum reflects increasing recognition of aim as a strategic imperative a growing community of owner operators and their partners are implementing practical and innovative aim solutions across the asset lifecycle we have come a long way in realizing the potential of aim across an enterprise
6781343 however the full aim vision will only be realized through cooperation within this community nrx is working closely with all stakeholders including owner operators engineering companies suppliers and solution partners such as sap and open text to address the compelling need of our customers for an end to end solution for aim

6781420 we believe that demand for online recruitment services will benefit during the next few years from a continued shift in recruitment advertising spending from newspapers to the internet steady increases in job turnover a shortage of qualified workers due to the retirement of the baby boomer generation and an eventual cyclical improvement in the labor market
6781421 underlying the growth of the online recruiting industry we believe specialized career web sites are growing slightly faster than the overall industry right now dices focus on specific industries tends to produce a more targeted set of job seekers and employment opportunities and better attracts higher end and passive job seekers we believe these attributes are attractive to customers which are becoming more sophisticated about analyzing the return on investment from online recruiting
6781422 the online recruitment industry is an evolving industry so competition will remain fierce in addition both the timing and pace of an eventual economic recovery remain difficult to predict we believe however that dice holdings experienced management team established brands vertical industry focus and attractive growth opportunities leave it well positioned to cope with these risks we thus believe that dice holdings will generate solid revenue and earnings growth during the next few years

6781831 good afternoon gentlemen i hope i am not interrupting your game at a particularly inopportune moment
6781832 ah well im sure jakob here is most displeased but youve given me a bit more time to think on my next move and for that i give you my thanks if youve never played against this one watch your back for he is a most devious opponent in the back game
6781833 enough about that tell me who is your lad there
6781834 ah my apologies gentlemen allow me to introduce to you my new squire lars mikkelson he has the dubious distinction of being the best swordsman from the entire current class of trainees at the academy and for his sins he must now endure my personal instruction if youll remember arlen this is the lad i was telling you about during my last visit
6781835 ah baron trendel a great pleasure it is to see you here amongst us supply types once again i so look forward to your infrequent visits why just the other day an item came in that i imagine would be the perfect thing for a noble warrior with such exceptional skills as yourself in the sword
6781836 well out with it man what treasure did your survey teams unearth this time
6781837 ah unearthed is the right word for it milord i have a team digging amongst the ruins of an old stone fort south of lake marmeluke and they sent back a fine specimen of a sword apparently untouched by the passage of years
6781838 here we go milord just you take a look at this
6781839 just you take a look at the inlay work on the hilt and the markings on the blade itself
6781840 oh yes baron the quartermaster invited me here for a few games and indeed the subject of his latest find managed to somehow make its way into our conversation of course i prefer the blade i carry as i have had it for quite a long time and am well used to its idiosyncrasies but alas as i run my own school and am not actually in the dukes command structure i do not have the privilege of requisitioning from the quartermasters supplies in any event as our friend jakob here was so deferential in pointing out to me
6781841 does this mean that as of yet no one has claimed the sword it is still open to request
6781842 ah baron you are quite correct this just came in yesterday and i have not as of yet had the chance to post notice of its arrival to the household officers and staff perhaps it is fitting that i havent as now i can make sure it is placed in your hands that you might choose to use it to better equip yourself or possibly your squire
6781843 alas baron it seems as though i will be unable to pass this sword into your keeping after all i had quite forgotten this letter just arrived in the post this very morning apparently you have been replaced as commander of the academy by captain hennesy of the border guards well that is a terrible shame indeed since that means that as you only served in your post at the discretion of his highness the duke that you are not only no longer responsible for the supply chain of the academy but in fact you are no longer a member of the doneghal military system at all
6781844 in fact im not sure why you came to visit us this morning unless it was to see my friend master finnegan here im afraid there is simply nothing i can do to help you as you are no longer in the supply chain
6781845 as you can see the duke has asked me to visit him and to pick up a few things along the way in fact i only need a few things for the journey a small notebook a scout surveying kit field rations and grain for two men and four horses for at least a three week trip water proofed saddlebags and two pack saddles extra water skins and good solid cold weather gear for both myself and my squire as you can see from the dukes invitation we anticipate hunting with the duke during the winter season and the cold weather gear must be sturdy and adequate enough for stays of a week at a time in the deep snow oh yes and additionally ill need proper field load out appropriate for a scout leathers chain helmet and shield for mikkelson here as all he has that fits is training leathers
6781846 oh yes and i do think that as squire mikkelson does not have a sword of his own issued to him at this time and shouldnt be forced to continue his education with a lesser blade perhaps i should see to it that he has the finest sword suitable to a young man of his rank i think in fact that i could entrust his care to no less than a well proven blade with a long provenance of duty and success he shall use the sword i have called my own for the last three years it is in exceptional condition and has been put to exceeding good use sadly this would tend to leave me without a sword of my own with which to make the journey overland it is fortunate that i have recently learned of a sword that would be well matched to a baron and knight of the order of radiance that served at the dukes pleasure and was rushing to attend to the duke at his command im sure the duke will agree when i speak to him in a few weeks
6781847 you know youre lucky he has a good sense of humor baron im sure it hurts him most grievously just now to part with that sword but give him a few days and hell come to appreciate the humor in your getting the better of him especially due to his over eagerness to brag when he felt you were a safe target in the short term youd best watch him very closely if you care to have equipment that doesnt fall apart or rust within the first five miles
6781848 i was going to send you a note ask you to come up and visit me sounds to me as though youre going to be busy wherever it is youre going do you know if youre coming back
6781849 the fact is just between us that ive been summoned by the duke as the kind of reward we both know best that a master will show when youve done a good job and are no longer needed where you are the feeling i get is that im going to be gone for quite a while and i have no way of knowing if the duke will send me this way again you know the duke retained me specifically to build the academy and apply my experience directly towards getting it up and running as fast as possible he told me he wanted me to give his men a taste of the hell i went through and prepare them for when the war with the orcs spread our way you know the principle you teach your students the same way the more you bleed in training the less you bleed in battle nothing he ever said indicated he intended to keep me on as the commander of the academy forever though
6781850 i dont suppose you have the time in your schedule to head back down south and spend a day at my school do you
6781851 you see i have a book that a student sent to me that i know you would be interested in reading it fills in some of the empty spaces in what we were discussing about the elven influence on arkadian infantry tactics i was hoping to have the chance to hand it over in person
6781852 the duke may have phrased his invitation as a request but you know me well enough to know that the request of a commanding officer bears the same urgency as a direct order so long as i have been assigned to assist him by knight commander geoff i must look upon him as my commanding officer therefore where my master calls like a good hound i shall come running
6781853 damn it all terin this really irritates the hell out of me
6781854 considering drummonds state of mind dont you think it would be a good idea to have your squire keep an eye on the supplies
6781855 lars supervise what the quartermaster is doing check the inventory of the equipment yourself make sure everything is there and verify the quality of it all with care once everything is gathered get it staged with the rest of our gear in the stables when youre done come find us well be at the golden gecko having a mead or three
6781856 make sure you ask the stable boy politely to look after the gear when youre done there and tip him well
6781857 there is a stall in the courtyard very near to the supply exit that bears a green flag with a yellow lizard embroidered on it that lizard my lad is a gecko
6781858 and i assure you well be having our meads without
6781859 that lad of yours has a likely way about him it looks like the scout bloodline still breeds true
6781860 yes he does but it makes training him a problem his reflexes and natural ability are better than most well trained swordsmen and he has no drive to push himself to be better he only enlisted in the first place for ready money to support his families farm and he has shown no pride in his heritage no desire to compete and no fire of ambition beyond earning a wage it was only by trying to overwork his abilities that i was able to draw him out of his shell at the academy and all that succeeded in doing was proving that when his back is against the wall he has an excellent instinct to do whatever he has to to survive and win unfortunately just yesterday he had his most challenging match against a pretty well coordinated team of boys he won but one of the boys took offense to a groin blow and called challenge
6781861 is that why you finally took a squire to get him out of the camp after he had to kill a boy i wondered what would cause you to change your mind about taking a lad into the kind of hell you grew up in
6781862 its worse than that the boy who called challenge had a brother there with him it was the two of them and a friend that mikkelson fought i said nothing at the time but from the way the brother acted i get the feeling that the one had a habit of keeping the other hothead out of trouble and had been a bit protective maybe over protective we were supposed to hold the duel this morning but it turned out that the boy took his own life in the night
6781863 a bad business all around but i understand your decision to take lars out with you if hes as good as youve said he is in the past hell be a good one to watch your back for you no matter how lacking in motivation he is to learn
6781864 i felt better about the thought of training him before this morning in truth the whole ride from the academy the boy kept silent he said not a word or gave sign of any feelings at all i dont know exactly what is going on in his head but i would have thought there would be some sign of sadness or anger or something at least over the boy dying or having to leave the academy so suddenly or something mayhap its nothing and he is just working things out for himself but it makes me uneasy when i see someone unaffected at all by the death of one who had been a comrade of sorts ive seen far too many of the sort that kills as easily as he rides and with less feeling i want nothing to do with training one that has no conscience or remorse
6781865 the trouble with you terin is youre a thinker and sometimes you think and analyze too damn much he may be a heartless killer or maybe he may just be quiet or maybe he respects you and looks up to you and just thinks that if he shows emotion in front of you that youll think him weak or a coward give him a week before you start inventing troubles ill offer you a caution though if you start suspecting him of being untrustworthy expect him to notice that youre treating him different scout bloodlines are touched by magic and scouts have been known to see small changes in behavior and interpret them as clearly as they read what an opponent will do next its all in the body language whether in relationships or personal combat
6781866 well you know ill take your advice seriously but in the meantime what did you have to say that you didnt want to share in front of mikkelson if he is so sensitive as all that he cant help but to have seen you shuffle him off for a reason
6781867 you know ive told you how impressed ive been with your performance the last few months in our little sparring matches you really have improved a great deal in your fine control and you absorb my instruction like a sponge
6781868 oh yes youve gotten better and you werent all that bad before i met you for all that you spend most of your time training on your own while struggling with running that academy youve improved more than most of my full time students since ive known you you take your skills seriously and you work hard and you are blessed with a great deal of natural talent
6781869 that is why i had wanted to surprise you by arranging for your testing
6781870 thats right for the last week ive had my students constructing the testing structure and outlying framework for a formal master of combat evaluation your next visit i was going to surprise you by running your ass through it you bastard
6781871 i said its about two weeks ride from here to the dukes hunting lodge are you planning on riding straight through or are you going to take the time to head north a few days and visit father arkanos at the church you know there arent any actual priests at any of the chapels east of here and as far as representation of your order i think youre about it this side of the duchy line
6781872 well it appears that drummond has kept his reputation for being quick and efficient i hope he hasnt kept his reputation for going light on the quality of equipment
6781873 arlen i too have felt my improvement these last several months and though i greatly desire to visit you and prove myself worthy of the praise and honor you give me i must do as my oaths require timeliness is of the essence on our journey i give you my word though that i will return to the academy and take you up on that offer when i can and dont forget to hold that tome for me
6781874 i do appreciate your consideration and kind thoughts master arlen it is a fine thing that you inteded to have me tested and i know why it was important to you that i earn the title and rank that would accompany a success you are a good man and i am honored to call you friend
6781875 but i have to be on the road while the light is still high and there is traveling to be done my heart calls me to go south with you but my duty carrier me east you can be certain ill be giving thought to you and ill be keeping up my training on the road but for now its best time i be gone
6781876 aye ill not be keeping you i know that look in your eye when a sudden thought having to do with your duty has caught you and there is nothing for it but to go rushing off to see to it right away but keep in mind ill be expecting you to darken my door as soon as youre back from your business to the east now go on with you and get yourselves on the road
6781877 and fare you both well and may tyr keep you safely in his hand along the way
6781878 eh i just do this for fun now school is my main focus
6781879 youve really got to create an artist page youre too damn talented to keep this hidden
6781880 no no no you will be on re hire but we dont know how long it will be before we will get to call you back it could be a month two months we have no idea how long

6781887 for the foolishness of god is wiser than mans wisdom and the weakness of god is stronger than mans strength
6781888 thats it i knew there was something the lord wanted me to press in on with you but until you said that i was searching and searching

6781896 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
6781897 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
6781898 still we are pleased with where cal state long beach placed in this years u s news rankings especially among our peer institutions
6781899 the organisers have done a fantastic job valencia is a great track
6781900 it has a pretty smooth surface and its going to be a pleasure to race here we went out on new tyres fairly early on and the track ramped up a lot towards the end of the session so its difficult to really tell but i think the track is suiting our car we will have to wait and see what happens tomorrow and in the race in terms of set up we made a considerable improvement today which is good
6781901 the sessions went well for us the long runs were good but we need to find a bit more pace when were out on new tyres conditions were changing all the time and the track became easier to drive as the sessions progressed its not the easiest of circuits so im pleased i did lots of preparation work on the simulator before i arrived im feeling positive ahead of tomorrows qualifying
6781902 we lost a set of tyres with nico following his spin and were obviously lucky to get away without any car damage otherwise weve run through our programme and have collected good information on tyres while doing long runs so were happy with the work weve done today

6781940 das ist nichts neues das ist schon okay ich finde die leute hier haben einen sensationellen job gemacht vor zw lf monaten hat man noch nicht einmal von der strecke gesprochen und jetzt f hrt man schon den ersten trainingstag hier ich glaube das ist beispielhaft was hier in spanien geleistet worden ist ein riesenstatement f r die formel 1 das ist sicherlich das allerwichtigste heute es gab einige berraschungen wenige ausrutscher keiner hat richtig die wand ber hrt zumindest nicht bei den formel 1 fahrern das war ein sehr starker auftakt muss ich sagen
6781941 valencia ist valencia monaco ist monaco montr al ist montr al
6781942 einige vergleichen die strecke mit monte carlo andere eher mit montr al und melbourne wie sehen sie diese neue strecke
6781943 ich denke valencia ist valencia monaco ist monaco montr al ist montr al es macht aus meiner sicht nicht viel sinn das zu vergleichen dass so etwas entstehen kann das ist bewundernswert hier hat vor einem jahr der americas cup stattgefunden man f hrte die baulichkeiten weiter was sicher sehr gut ist ich glaube das schickt eine unheimlich starke botschaft in die ganze welt die hier live zuguckt trotz der olympiade wird man sich sicherlich sehr f r die formel 1 interessieren ich denke wir haben heute schon sehr sch ne bilder gesehen
6781944 bernie ecclestone hat sich da reingeh ngt wie kein anderer und hat das mit der stadt und mit der regierung verhandelt wir haben hier unser auto zu beginn 2007 vorgestellt da hat man so ein bisschen gemunkelt dass in valencia mal was stattfinden k nnte aber das ist gerade mal 16 monate her es ist eine aufstrebende stadt ich h tte damals nie geglaubt dass wir hier anderthalb jahre sp ter einen grand prix fahren werden was an sicherheitsvorkehrungen rennstrecke mauern und z unen aufgebaut wurde das ist bewundernswert kompliment an die organisatoren

6781948 ich wei mit wie viel sprit wir gefahren sind dass wir konstant waren dass wir von der mauer weggeblieben sind also noch nicht das allerletzte gegeben haben dass wir auch selten einen verbremser hatten insofern war das ein ziemlicher auftakt nach ma w rde ich sagen die abst nde machen mich noch nicht nachdenklich ich w rde mich wundern wenn renault und honda morgen mit gleicher strategie dazwischenfahren sollten ansonsten haben wir in etwa das kr fteverh ltnis wie wir es das ganze jahr kennen mal rot ein bisschen st rker zuletzt waren wir silberpfeile ein bisschen st rker auch in ungarn denn ohne den reifenschaden von lewis war da wirklich alles drin insofern sind wir absolut im plan und ich bin happy mit dem verlauf

6782021 people talk about basketball on grass youre making them play in space
6782022 you used to go into the recruiting process and get those big big defensive linemen or linebackers well guess what they better be able to run because this game has turned into a much faster game when you play in space you have to cover the whole field
6782023 weve been working in this direction for the last three years recruiting personnel to be able to match up against people playing in space
6782024 youre going to see it more and more until defenses show theyre capable of stopping it
6782025 over history there are things that come in the bear 46 defense the 34 defense versus the 4 3 the run and shoot now its the spread
6782026 theyre calling plays at the line of scrimmage check with me where they just stand there and they look over to the coach and he says run the play or flip it to the other side
6782027 but whats going to end up happening which it always does is that defenses will eventually catch up with the offenses and then the offenses will go to something else its a copy cat game and whatever is working people will try doing
6782028 they look like theyre playing fast and it looks like the defensive staff is starting to develop some depth we can trust in
6782029 that was one of my biggest questions because weve got so many guys here interjecting into this mix

6782032 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6782033 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

6782036 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6782037 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6782038 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6782039 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6782040 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6782041 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6782042 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6782043 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6782044 treating remittances as just another banking transaction is the mistake most make
6782045 icici recognized this as a strategic business opportunity in the beginning of this decade
6782046 six years ago nobody was talking about remittances part of my job is to explain to banks that migrant workers are an attractive client base
6782047 many banks act as agents for money transfer companies if you are receiving a remittance you go to a bank branch they hand you cash and never offer you a bank loan it happens a lot more than you think
6782048 were trying to provide industrywide initiatives so theres standard pricing and delivery wherever you are in the world
6782049 at a minimum participants will have to support swiftnet fileact store and forward release 6 1 and be able to send and receive the relevant iso 20022 xml messages specified under swiftnet for workers remittances

6782059 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6782060 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6782061 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6782062 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6782075 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6782076 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6782077 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6782078 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6782079 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6782080 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6782081 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6782082 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6782083 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6782084 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6782085 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6782086 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6782087 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6782090 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6782091 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6782092 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6782093 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6782100 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6782101 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6782102 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6782103 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6782104 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6782105 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6782106 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6782107 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6782108 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6782112 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6782113 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6782114 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6782115 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6782116 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6782117 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6782118 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6782119 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6782120 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6782121 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6782122 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6782123 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6782124 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6782125 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6782126 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6782127 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6782128 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6782129 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

6782189 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them
6782190 i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies

6782257 there are other veep choices tim kaine seems like a solid man but selecting him would be disastrous it would underline all the anxieties voters have about youth and inexperience evan bayh has impeccably centrist credentials but the country is not in the mood for dispassionate caution

6782260 this is exactly the sort of baseless horserace speculation that i frequently criticize
6782261 our analysis suggests that the mccain ticket jumps by 13 points by adding gov pawlenty to the ticket

6782306 as you may have seen there are a whole host of informative posts on the social media and analysis sessions which both took place earlier this week my favourite posts can be found via the here there are two things that i would like to pick up on specifically web 2 0 world session where marshall sponder confirmed that as well as understanding that social media measurement is about conversations we will only get to the next level of measurement if we treat visitors from twitter for example differently than visitors from forums and then differently again from direct visitors without measuring the conversation and the outcomes of that conversation we are missing a huge chunk of useful data the online marketing blog listed the key takeaways from the social media and analysis session as 1 there is no killer metric 2 track anything possible to glean insight 3 social media is not just about numbers 4 its all relative focus on benchmarking and trends 5 measuring social media does not roi for social media 6 view monitoring social media as a social intelligence programme involving the worlds biggest focus group

6782308 as we previously announced we have been working for some time with petrobras to replace their current pipeline protective coating protocols and materials with our patented protective coating system and to incorporate our products into their newest pipeline installation with a projected value for industrial nanotech from 3 7 million dollars us to over 5 8 million dollars us for the first project
6782309 this is a very significant change for them it has taken two years of work with petrobras on product application specifications including my two visits to their headquarters in rio de janeiro and a three day tour of ongoing pipeline installation projects in the rural northern region of brazil the upcoming visit to our facilities the meetings with our phd chemists and my meetings with them in new york are a breakthrough step and should provide a more specific time frame for the beginning of these projects

6782318 unsere proteste erinnern die welt an die tragische realit t der illegitimen besatzung tibets durch die chinesische regierung und dass chinas f hrung dringend eine l sung f r die tibetische bev lkerung braucht

6782324 we expected that every lever would affect all of the drives
6782325 the results were startling you can try to create rewards that encourage innovation and foster collaboration but rewards that try to do all of those things get to complicated incentives are not the best choice to engage those other drives you could use a screwdriver to open everything but it would be best to use it to open a screw
6782326 its not hierarchical you have to do all of them at once thats an important difference from other models
6782327 a poor showing on one drive diminishes the impact of high scores on the other three they cannot be ordered hierarchically or substituted one for another
6782328 you cant just pay employees a lot and hope theyll feel enthusiastic about their work in an organization where bonding is not fostered nor is it enough to help people bond as a tight knit team when they are underpaid

6782332 rune factory a fantasy harvest moon new screens for europe
6782333 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6782334 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6782335 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6782336 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer
6782337 when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is illicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit
6782338 you can make philosophical arguments that are difficult to debate but at the same time youre just sort of ignoring the enormity of the problem
6782339 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6782340 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6782341 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6782342 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6782343 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6782344 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6782345 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6782346 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados

6782366 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6782367 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy
6782368 unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6782369 lexis nexis have significantly more information that any of our competitors
6782370 the fact that we have a comprehensive database and that we are leader in terms of the interface and the accessibility i think we would regard as a strength lexis nexis is putting a huge effort in to continue to make our interfaces more intuitive more usable
6782371 probably one of the things we didnt get exactly right when we launched the first version of our new platform three years ago is we listened to a lot of customer feedback we put too much emphasis on what we would call our expert or professional users
6782372 i dont think the ft had a choice while it is effectively an increase in price for ft content however you buy it it the ft needs to establish what the market is and which content within the ft that people value
6782373 there are two big opportunities we can use social networks as a way of creating stronger tiese with both our authors and our readers
6782374 the other example is lawyers or tax or even information professionals are looking for valuable content if we find that the content in certain social networks or on expert blogs becomes useful we would like to be able to direct people
6782375 the object of my school is to is to show how many extraordinary things even a lazy and ordinary man may see if he can spur himself to the single activity of seeing
6782376 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
6782377 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
6782378 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
6782379 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
6782380 weve definitely lost 20 percent of the population this year and probably more
6782381 we have rangers with them and were trying to reinforce them but the rangers are outnumbered 20 to one
6782382 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6782383 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6782384 theyre not on sale until tomorrow if we have any left after tonights super exclusive launch party which is invite only
6782385 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6782386 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6782387 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6782401 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6782402 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6782403 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6782404 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6782405 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6782406 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6782407 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6782408 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6782409 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6782410 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6782411 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6782412 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6782413 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6782414 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6782415 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6782416 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6782417 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6782418 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6782419 youre just going to have to hear from the campaign and theyll make the announcement when theyre ready
6782420 my mom in kansas city loves it when someone will talk about me as vp
6782421 and if hes going to say one people one nation he can raise the banner of unity with her as his vice presidential running mate
6782422 if a baby is born alive after a botched abortion can be thrown away as medical trash
6782423 every infant born alive even an infant that survives an abortion procedure is considered a human being
6782424 there is no right to destroy a child that has been born alive
6782425 if a baby is born alive after a botched abortion can be thrown away as medical trash
6782426 if a baby is born alive after a botched abortion can be thrown gt away as medical trash

6782428 i work full time but food gas everything has just gone through the roof
6782429 its horrible congress is on vacation and theyre probably soaking up the rays somewhere were soaking up high gas prices
6782430 more travelers concerned about the economy gasoline prices and rising airfares are opting to travel by train bus motorcycle and cruise ship to their holiday weekend destinations
6782431 some of my buddies couldnt afford it this year it just costs too much
6782432 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
6782433 new yorkers have been bucking the trend that weve seen in the rest of the country
6782434 people of earth stop your bickering i am from harvard and im here to help
6782435 dont you conservatives understand democrats care about the little guy theyre on the side of the proletariat i mean workers and as obama has so eloquently put it if the workers would only stop clinging to their silly sky god and guns theyd understand that
6782436 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6782437 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6782438 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat

6782445 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6782446 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6782447 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6782448 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6782449 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6782450 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6782451 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6782452 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6782453 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6782454 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6782455 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6782456 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6782457 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6782458 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6782459 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6782460 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6782461 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6782462 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6782463 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6782464 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6782465 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6782466 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6782467 poner de relieve la contaminaci n ac stica y el ruido que supone el circuito para estos barrios
6782468 el aislamiento del barrio de natzaret donde los vecinos no pueden salir andando sino que tienen que hacerlo en autob s p blico o en coche particular
6782469 el mal uso del dinero p blico haciendo otro circuito cuando en la provincia de valencia ya hay uno en cheste y cuando la ciudad tiene muchas otras necesidades como un colegio p blico en natzaret o un centro de salud en el grao
6782470 es exagerado el impacto ac stico al que se nos somete en contra de nuestra voluntad
6782471 se comprometi con los vecinos a que la guardia civil tome muestras de ruido
6782472 si el delegado cumple su promesa y como sospechamos los niveles de ruido son superiores a los permitidos en suelo urbano

6782506 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6782507 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6782508 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6782509 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6782510 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

6782584 the first reason is that khodorkovsky failed to learn the profession of a sewing machine operator and this despite his education intellect and managerial experience the second reason is a reprimand issued on 15 october 2007 by the penal colonys administration for failing to comply with an order to put his hands behind his back
6782585 i cannot repent crimes that did not exist i cannot do this not only because of my belief in the unjustness of the verdict but also because of my fear for the fate of many other people who have become hostages of the situation related to my conviction as to the damages it should be clarified that prior to my arrest yukos was worth about 40 billion us dollars 973 704 billion roubles 26 971 billion euros 21 516 billion uk pounds today i no longer own anything if somebody believes that some additional damages have been inflicted after completion of the story with yukos they have been repaid with a vengeance

6782604 there was a lot of interest especially earlier in the season now since were so far into the season its slowing down and in southern louisiana fields have been getting a lot of rain
6782605 there is a cost benefit at least its worth a look from switching from diesel to electric most folks especially with older power plants could see cost savings fairly quickly they can probably get a return on their investment within two years at least thats what most of the growers ive worked with have penciled out
6782606 to be honest the challenge is the huge variability of electrical costs across the state
6782607 essentially every power company every electric co op has a totally different rate structures for projecting what electrical costs will be
6782608 so when someone calls and says this is what i need to do i say thats great
6782609 even within the same company depending on where you are in a parish or within a section of a power grid the rate structure may differ the basic rate may be the same but what youll be charged for surcharges and connection fees vary tremendously thats where the biggest cost variability comes in
6782610 for a 100 horsepower system youre looking at around 6 000 the control panel for it may cost another 1 000
6782611 the challenge is where the pump is located youve got to get three phase power to the pump if its right next to the road and a power line youre golden but if youre in the middle of the boonies youre potentially looking at much more expense it costs about 7 per foot to put in poles and three phase line that can run up costs very quickly
6782612 that allows them to do some of their own calculations in one vermilion parish operation the producer was growing rice rotated into soybeans he also had some crawfish
6782613 we looked at where the pump was located he was using a surface water pump rather than a deep water well the operation was feeding two major irrigation networks from one major pump we reviewed the pumping capacity the irrigation lines in place and then how far hed have to bring in electrical lines
6782614 he had to sign a five year usage contract but could make payments for three years he bought the system at 4 15 diesel it turned out the monthly fee for putting in the power line cost the same as one days worth of irrigation
6782615 irrigation costs are part of that irrigation costs need to be evaluated just like everything else in a growers business looking at a cheaper source of pumping power is worth doing
6782616 electricity may not lower pumping costs by 90 percent but most systems weve reviewed are looking at between 40 and 50 percent cost reduction
6782617 are only for existing systems not for putting in new ones in louisiana were looking at some nrcs programs for well development well reconditioning that theres cost share money for
6782618 that would allow us to go out and do audits of irrigation and pumping systems then wed be able to say ok landowner this is where your irrigation system is pumping currently looking at these general values for new or refurbished systems this is what your system should cost in the future if we switch from diesel to electric were trying to get funding to put in at least two or three pilot programs in southwest and northeast louisiana
6782619 variable frequency drives are the newest type of pumping system out really they make use of the same pumps with a different way to control them
6782620 vary the flow rate in the system to match what your delivery needs to be it also reduces the amount of power consumption during the start up phase the variable rate pumps dont cause huge surges of electrical usage
6782621 and some of the control units need to be in extremely well ventilated buildings or in air conditioning that can increase the cost even more
6782622 but they do use less electricity and demand charges when power is used and how much is used during peak times can be taken into account
6782623 for a normal rice or crawfish producer though the variable rate pumps are probably above and beyond whats needed
6782624 this program will reward producers who adopt conservation through beneficial crop rotation as appropriate
6782625 trade complaint and an allowable domestic support program it fits in the green box
6782626 with better rotation they get increased yields and higher quality they also use fewer chemicals because they will have less disease pressure
6782627 this program comes under the conservation title said allen mccorvey research coordinator national center for peanut competitiveness at tifton ga
6782628 payments go to producers who adopt resource conserving crop rotation programs as determined by the secretary of agriculture
6782629 it evolved but the peanut industry will work with usda nrcs to develop and implement the csp rotation program to make it beneficial to peanut producers
6782630 they need to project income mix for the next five years
6782631 we still have a lot to do to get the regulations done
6782632 and we will see an evolution as farmers learn how to use this program
6782633 it could be hard for southeastern farmers to see benefits
6782634 i see these winners and what they share with the industry and how they are successful in their operations as being teachers for the rest of us and helping to make the rest of us successful as we go back to our own farms
6782635 the peanut profitability award truly gives a whole farm picture of the peanut production on these growers farms
6782636 we look at both the variable and fixed costs and whenever we look at both components of cost it takes a while for these farmers and perhaps their wives to compile all of the information required
6782637 from this we decide the winners whoever has the lowest per unit cost of production
6782638 we dont look at high yields in single small plots but we take into account the overall profitability of the peanut enterprise
6782639 since its inception in 2000 this awards program has honored 27 deserving growers from throughout the southeast virginia carolina and southwest regions of the united states
6782640 each class of winners continues to impress with their innovative technologies and creativity in improving bottom line profits
6782641 the aim of peanut profitability has been to recognize those growers who have shown adaptability in the face of change and who have continued to produce profitable crops this years class of winners exemplifies the peanut growers who have overcome the perils of farming while continuing to improve their profitability to be in the presence of a peanut profitability award winner is to truly be in the presence of greatness
6782642 finding labor teaching them how to do things on the farm and inspiring them to do their best is critical to managing our farm
6782643 thats slowed harvest way down farmers dont want to rut fields up especially those wanting to put in a second crop
6782644 were also running out of time for a second crop the traditional recommendation for a second crop is you need to be harvested by aug 15 the later it gets the more likely the second crop will be caught by a frost
6782645 in the machine ready to begin harvest as soon as possible waiting for the dew to get off we had a heavy fog this morning theres a 60 percent chance of rain today and tomorrow
6782646 muddy and we cant harvest where it would mean cutting ruts the rule for this farm cut when its dry and stop when it rains
6782647 farmers will force the issue as much as they can we run into this piece meal harvesting every few years instead of working from 11 a m to dark you work from noon to 3 p m then the rains chase you out of the field the same scenario plays out the next day
6782648 we dont have a very late crop what we do have is a stretched out crop there was a lot of late planted rice because people who hadnt intended to plant rice saw the prices and got in at the last minute and when the crawfish price fell some farmers drained fields and went with rice
6782649 that are pretty good maybe better than last year the real question of course is whether the later rice will pull the yield average down but so far yields are encouraging in the upper 30 and lower 40 barrel range there have been reports of 50 barrel rice as well
6782650 its a little discouraging that the rice price went down with the latest usda estimates farmers desperately need higher prices to counteract the input costs this has been a very expensive crop to grow
6782651 one of my friends crop is dry at 15 percent or 16 percent moisture and the rain is setting him back that rice is very ripe and needs to be cut
6782652 are going to be hurt well still do some of that but where weve rutted it up well leave it alone thats the same story with my neighbors
6782653 energy suppliers have to take steps towards covering their costs and i am sorry that we cannot delay these price rises any longer
6782654 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6782655 access to the conflict affected areas remains the most serious constraint to our humanitarian response i call upon the russia authorities to ensure that humanitarian aid workers have full and safe access to the people in need

6782657 oh i wish we could do this but its not right for fallout
6782658 with rice its always an interesting year but nothing as interesting as what weve been through this year were kind of in a lull between old crop and new crop but still there is a tremendous amount of demand in the western hemisphere for u s rice in other countries rice is a fundamental issue
6782659 i was at the rice congress of the americas in brazil when costco or sams talked about rationing rice at that meeting which was for latin america we had 13 countries from outside the western hemisphere it just sent panic and made everyone think the united states was rationing rice and desperate we got calls from mexico wondering if the united states was going to ban exports of rice
6782660 i think over the course of the next 12 months well see the market do some alarming things thailand says it will export 10 million tons this year it is at 61 percent of that already now it has been exporting 1 million tons per month if it was on course for 10 million it should be exporting about 600 000 tons per month
6782661 this is an area that causes concern for us rice is the food stamp of the world it is the most political food in most areas
6782662 china could eat the entire u s rice crop in three and a half weeks a lot of rice has gone out of production the demand created from people moving up to the middle class means they want to eat more protein they want beef and chicken to get beef and chicken means feed grains and fuel theres been a considerable shift in acreage theyve taken about 7 million acres out of rice production in china
6782663 china is going to be the first to do it ge rice and i think youre going to see india and others come right along behind i think that will stir the debate here in the united states
6782664 they are a bean and corn country but rice consumption continues to go up in poor economic times rice will always be there because itll fit the needs of the low income people
6782665 it makes sense to invest our time and money in our backyard the western hemisphere thats where the long term growth possibilities are good for farmers in the delta
6782666 we gladly share that information because increasing rice consumption anywhere in the hemisphere is good for all of us columbia and peru are two countries where were going to implement the program in 2009
6782667 i think were going to see a considerable amount of u s rice headed to venezuela
6782668 the prices have been too high for them when poor countries cant afford the price of rice they force the public to eat something else theyll take noodles and chop them up into tiny pieces so they resemble rice its what they do in haiti cuba or parts of africa
6782669 i dont know what our government does period i the obama affect
6782670 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co

6782755 many analysts expect apple to sell around 11 million iphone 3gs in 2008 and another 25 million in 2009 but perhaps the most optimistic forecast is from piper jaffray analyst gene munster who expects the company to sell 13 million this year and 45 million next year
6782756 while final sales cant be known until after the fact clues are emerging as to apples production plans as of mid august they were ambitious businessweek has learned apple plans to build 40 million to 45 million iphone 3gs in the 12 months through august 2009 according to a person familiar with the companys plans the low end of that range is 52 more than the 26 million munster expects the company to sell in that time

6782760 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6782761 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6782762 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6782763 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6782764 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6782765 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6782766 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6782767 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6782768 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6782769 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6782770 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6782771 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6782772 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6782773 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6782774 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6782775 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6782776 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6782777 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6782778 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6782779 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6782780 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6782781 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6782782 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6782793 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6782794 this is a planning took where all things are going
6782795 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6782796 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6782797 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6782798 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6782799 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6782800 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6782801 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6782802 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6782803 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6782804 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6782805 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6782806 i thought my iphonw was dead until i saw your ad on craigs list
6782807 oh you can download a program to do all that
6782808 1 day and i already got the phone back wow you saved the day
6782809 just a quick note to say you are a lifesaver cant believe how fast you shipped the iphone back
6782810 less than 2 days and my iphone is back and working perfect and feel free to use us as a reference
6782811 big thanks for all your help and getting the phone back so fast
6782812 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6782813 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6782814 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6782815 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6782816 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6782817 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6782818 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6782819 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6782820 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6782821 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6782822 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6782823 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6782824 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6782825 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6782826 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6782827 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6782828 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6782829 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6782830 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6782831 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6782832 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6782833 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6782834 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6782835 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6782836 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6782843 that inexperience is a good thing for us theres a lot less baggage amongst this crew at the moment
6782844 we saw that in our first match against the all blacks a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches
6782845 im certainly hoping that thats the case and i think the mindset of this team is extremely positive
6782846 the environment this year is one thats a little bit more relaxed and about backing yourself
6782847 weve shown over the last seven weeks we have conceded more points than nearly anyone in the competition
6782848 defensively our backs really need to improve but also collectively as a group
6782849 we need to be really adding a lot of pressure through our midfield so the ball is not getting delivered through but we are under no illusions that defensively some players are struggling to keep their man quiet and stop a lot of goals
6782850 thats going to be a huge area and huge focus tonight and if we are any chance of winning the game our defensive group really has to stand up
6782851 i think collectively we have definitely got a point to prove regardless of whether you are out of contract or you are old or young
6782852 i think everyone is on notice at the moment the way we have been playing is unacceptable and its not up to the standard we really require of each player
6782853 theres no doubt everyone is on notice and we really need to get back to the way we play footy
6782854 its an interesting one wholesale changes is sort of difficult
6782855 we are in a delicate stage we have played a lot of young guys and got a few more games into them
6782856 watching him come up through the racing ranks i knew that he was a wheelman and i always tried to sell him as better than i thought he was but man hes on fire i always said hey you think i am doing good you should see my little brother so its great to see him do well its surprising but you can see it coming and i am glad hes transitioned well into his new race team the next thing i am waiting for is for him to remember who helped him get to this point and give some of that information my way
6782857 even though its easy to lose your temper at bristol i love racing there
6782858 its a fast track that always produces great racing for the fans i dont think ive ever had a boring race at bristol
6782859 you just have to realize that more than likely youre going to make someone mad or youre going to get mad at someone else you cant help it youre turning 500 laps around the place thats a lot of time to get into it with someone
6782860 races at bristol are always crazy but they seem to get a little wilder when were racing at night if theres a full moon watch out that only seems to add to the madness i dont know why the night races seem to have more wrecks maybe its because the fans are so hyped up by the time the race starts the drivers just feed off of their excitement
6782861 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6782862 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6782863 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6782864 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6782865 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6782866 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6782867 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6782868 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6782869 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

6782872 his agents came to toulon and we came to a financial agreement pretty easily
6782873 i only had one demand given his inexperience i didnt want him to be considered as one of the two supplementary players we were allowed to sign after the july 15 deadline for signing players
6782874 so on the morning of the 15th sbw sent us his signed contract that we sent straight away to the league
6782875 the problem was the four year contract that sonny had with the bulldogs
6782876 he quickly explained to us that his departure from australia would not be simple and that the bulldogs directors wouldnt just let him go like that
6782877 tana umaga and i decided to say he had come for a meeting between him and sbw to speak of his possible signing
6782878 i measured the risk of engaging a player who had never played in rugby union but tana was sure about him
6782879 he assured me that we wouldnt have anything to regret so i gave him the green light to contact him
6782880 he came back 24 hours later to say he had the agreement of the player to come
6782881 after the training match the bulldogs understood the player would not be coming back and negotiations to finish with all these procedures started
6782882 at the outset they wanted an astronomical sum of money then they asked us to make a step in their direction and not play sbw against toulouse
6782883 it was only a friendly match so i accepted unconditionally the following morning the tone of the discussions were a lot more peaceful
6782884 the bulldogs directors wanted to get out of it with their heads high and with the most money possible
6782885 we came to an agreement fairly easily especially with the player in person accepting to pay a large part of the financial compensation to come to toulon
6782886 we did make contact some time ago with sonny bill williams
6782887 he said to us that he wanted to move from rugby league to union but that is where it finished
6782888 today we havent signed a contract because i havent met sonny bill williams
6782889 his agents came to toulon and we came to a financial agreement pretty easily

6782895 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6782896 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6782897 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6782898 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6782899 we are disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6782900 we take full responsibility and accept the penalties nascar has levied against us today
6782901 we had come to the conclusion that we would add to any nascar imposed penalties with the minimum being suspension for the remainder of the season for those involved including our two nationwide series crew chiefs there will also be an additional monetary fine beyond the amount announced by nascar earlier today which will be the responsibility of those involved
6782902 i apologize with great remorse for the actions that i took after the michigan race last saturday afternoon
6782903 my apology is extended to nascar the nascar officials joe and team president j d gibbs our drivers all of jgrs sponsors and especially to all of the jgr family members that i have misrepresented joe and j d gibbs trust me to lead this race team with honesty and integrity i have failed them and feel great remorse for doing so i accept the penalties imposed by nascar and joe gibbs racing and make no excuses

6782905 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6782906 we need to protect our people how would we be able to bring our managers and their families if they are going to get beaten if anybody is under the impression that because we have made a large investment of 15 billion rupees 184m we would not move then they are wrong because we would move to protect our people
6782907 tata say they have no plan b but the factory is nearly complete and the money is spent in west bengal if they start again somewhere else it will take time and there will be a cost implication however nano will be loss making at this price so tata may save some money in that way
6782908 its disastrous the real problem is the way that land was acquired by government strong arming people into selling their land
6782909 i think the real question here is whether indians want to remain starving peasants or part of an urban proletariat my bet is the latter
6782910 i think we are seeing local people having a say in the process and sometimes projects are pulled just recently 11 dams were cancelled after local protests in sikkim industrialisation has been violent in other countries but i think indian democracy can accommodate it without the violence

6782914 you have to look at the new leadership here at u s track amp field and wonder if its been a vacuum of leadership there does seem to be no cohesiveness seems everyone has their own agenda
6782915 and guys to be quite honest the fact that there was a departure by the previous ceo and there was a vacancy there in the olympic year quite possibly could have meant that that vacuum of the leadership for usa track amp field has affected severely the performance of this u s olympic team

6782917 ive carried on too much in the past and its time i bit my tongue
6782918 it was very frustrating watching the boys last saturday we had so many players out and i know i really should have been there
6782919 ive learned my lesson were all human when we lash out as are referees when they make mistakes
6782920 but i know i have to keep quiet now and improve my record
6782921 it was a great point to get and has given everyone confidence going into tomorrow
6782922 i am sure the way we have been training this week we are going there in an attack framed mind
6782923 weve always had entertaining games against them and i am sure this wont be any different
6782924 i just hope its not another 5 4 sydney won game i can do without the stress of that
6782925 hes one of those players who doesnt give defenders breathing space hes mobile lively and chases everything

6782949 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

6783033 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the last two years confirm that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe

6783037 es ist bedauerlich dass die vp dieses thema so gering sch tzt denn die bev lkerung w rde sich zu recht erwarten dass die politik weitere schritte gegen die enorme teuerungswelle unternimmt
6783038 die sp hat seri se und finanzierbare vorschl ge im kampf gegen die teuerung auf den tisch gelegt es ist zu hoffen dass die vp doch noch ber ihren schatten springt und gemeinsam mit der sp noch vor der wahl die notwendigen entlastungen f r die bev lkerung beschlie t

6783044 this has been a difficult decision for the council to make but it has been taken with the best interests of the town centres regeneration and the people of rochdale in mind
6783045 there is real momentum in our town centre plans assisted by the recent news about metrolink and the funding approval for the new bus station
6783046 a drawn out legal dispute would have led to significant delays to the town centre redevelopment as well as substantial costs to the public purse
6783047 this way we can re run the process with the minimum delay and with the benefit of knowing the implications of recent case law
6783048 the decision taken by the council to re run the developer selection process has been based purely on the legal implications of recent case law
6783049 we are of course disappointed that we are not being able to actively pursue this important scheme for rochdale
6783050 it is unfortunate that we are having to re run the developer selection procedure but this offers the best way of avoiding a significant delay to our town centre redevelopment plans
6783051 we now have the benefit of the last selection exercise and the publics response to help guide the new invitation to developers
6783052 local authorities across the country are having to consider the implications of these recent legal cases for their own developer selection procedures this has forced the government to issue new guidance on such procurement procedures we will need to evaluate the new recommendations when we make the fresh invitation to developers in a few months time
6783053 i think this decision has been made to minimise any disruption what the council needs to do now is ensure that everything is done by the book and that we can continue to move these plans on
6783054 they are trying to hide behind obscure greek case law when the real reason is that they are legally bound to publish the criteria on which they judged the bids they havent done this because they failed to take into account the views of the public when selecting their preferred bidder
6783055 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
6783056 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
6783057 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
6783058 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
6783059 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

6783061 did air france just let you cruise on through with these when you boarded the plane in paris
6783062 why wouldnt they this is checked baggage not carry on
6783063 theyre toys we bought them in a french toy store
6783064 i understand what youre trying to say sir but guns like these arent legal in the united states im going to verify that with the commanding officer
6783065 but what do you believe is the problem with these toy guns
6783066 so lets pretend they arent toys lets say theyre real guns would that be a problem if we say theyre real guns can i keep them
6783067 toy guns like this arent legal in the u s
6783068 i got that but real guns like this are so lets say theyre real
6783069 these are illegal guns may i have all of your passports please go sit over there and the commanding officer will be with you in a little while
6783070 can you believe this two minutes after walking out of this airport we could buy real handguns that could actually do some harm to someone so who do these guys think theyre protecting
6783071 but it looks like theyre trying to protect their jobs did you see those tables by the x ray scanner with tonights confiscated items they were full of potted flowers raw eggs coconuts and other agricultural contraband these guns were probably the biggest haul of the night
6783072 weve got more handguns per capita than almost any country in the world but if a 9 year old brings a toy gun through customs his dads a criminal and guess what happens next my name goes into some vast government data base as a gun smuggler hopefully i wont be detained
6783073 may i speak with you a moment sir away from your children
6783074 now i realize that you were just trying to bring toy guns through customs and that you probably didnt even know that you were breaking the law so were just going to let you go with a warning but let me give you this document that states
6783075 of course you would know that these are toy guns

6783516 speaking on behalf of all oklahoma republicans and in the spirit of true bi partisanship i want to join governor henry in inviting barack obama to oklahoma well break out all of the oklahoma hospitality we can if obama would campaign alongside nancy riley robert murphy keith erwin and richard lerblance
6783517 well even pay for their meal at petes place or the isle of capri in krebs if obama likes great italian food
6783518 if that schedule is too taxing a rally on the south steps of the capitol with a photo op of obama standing arms aloft with riley murphy erwin and lerblance and any other willing democrat would be sufficient
6783519 if obama doesnt have the time or inclination to visit his good friends in oklahoma i urge my democrat friends in the senate to make public their support for the top of their ticket
6783520 why wouldnt nancy riley robert murphy richard lerblance or keith erwin declare their allegiance

6783523 after my departure they may be able at any time to recall
6783524 the uncomfortable truth for the many devoted fans of senator obama is that the more the race is about him the less likely he is to win it
6783525 some people approach hybrids as a silver bullet to their gas bills
6783526 in some cases its true but some hybrids dont show a real world improvement in fuel economy at all
6783527 i have been involved with rock the vote since its inception and proud of the work they have done
6783528 there are such critical issues facing our country from high gas prices to climate change that we need to do more then just register to vote we need to get our friends registered too
6783529 we are thrilled to partner with sheryl crow to register young voters
6783530 bringing together music and politics is core to rock the votes mission working with sheryl we can reach out to her fans and encourage them to register and encourage their friends family and co workers to do the same

6783532 barack obamas note was approved for publication in the international media even before he put in the western wall a short time after he wrote it at the king david hotel in jerusalem
6783533 let me say something about the message management he didnt have reporters with him he didnt have a press pool he didnt do a press conference
6783534 what some would call fake interviews because they are not interviews from a journalist
6783535 weve not seen a presidential candidate do this in my recollection ever before
6783536 progress has been due mainly to an increase in the number of troops and a change in their strategy i was an early advocate of the surge at a time when it had few supporters in washington sen barack obama was an equally vocal opponent
6783537 i did what i was supposed to do she did what she was supposed to do but i guess it wasnt gods will
6783538 i could not believe that i was out and when i heard last night i was in the final it was my time

6783540 what were concerned about is putting a carbon pollution protection wall around a lot of the big polluters and making the rest of us do the work taking this approach would strangle australias shift to a low carbon economy strangle our attempts to grow cleaner and greener jobs we want other voices to speak up and even to speak within the bca
6783541 for the past several years luxe worldwide hotel members have focused their booking and revenue success with the travel agent community because that has proven to be the most profitable revenue stream and ranks highest of all third party revenue channels
6783542 they are the lowest cost distribution channel outside a hotels own web site powered by luxes booking engine
6783543 we never want a travel agent to be disappointed by a consumer who goes online and finds a better rate
6783544 travel agents upsell they tend to be used by the high end luxury travelers
6783545 that is why the yield is so good from their bookings and why we work as hard as possible to protect them and to exemplify this commitment we are now offering lower rates than best available to the consortia travel agent to ensure brand loyalty and confidence in rates agents offer to their customers

6783560 ive trained for 40 years ive trained moderate horses and ive never had a good one yet but hes good
6783561 hes never won a listed race or a group race and now hes won a group one
6783562 hes been chinned in the stewards cup but he always gives his all
6783563 i think hes better over five furlongs to be honest
6783564 ive got to give credit to my son and daughter as they train the horses now i said to them if i win a group one ill probably hand it his licence over because i cant do any more
6783565 were looking for three more players to come in before the deadline but theyve got to be the right players
6783566 we definitely need one more defender theres no doubt about that
6783567 theres coloccini who can play right left back centre back and holding midfield so if we get another defender then certainly he becomes a very important player for us
6783568 the truth is that i dont know anything about my future
6783569 my representatives are negotiating and looking for a way out whereas i feel happy here at real zaragoza

6783574 people see london irish as a team that tries to play an attacking style they often dont know what were going to do next
6783575 in international rugby you need that maybe that unpredictability has been something that has been missing from england over the last few years
6783576 defences are so tight nowadays that you need something different
6783577 that unpredictability was there against ireland in the six nations but obviously we need to do more work in this area
6783578 is really about the green effect it may pay off in many years but if not at least it is green green is very popular they transit users love them hybrids
6783579 i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff
6783580 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6783581 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6783582 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6783583 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6783584 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6783585 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6783586 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
6783587 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6783588 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6783589 ive won midget championships a junior league title two world junior championships and some other minor hockey championships but i dont think teams win because im on them
6783590 ive been fortunate to play with great teams there are great players who go unnoticed because theyre not on the best teams
6783591 i was put on great teams and given opportunities that i made the most of ive been fortunate on those occasions when we came through and won
6783592 im a lot smaller than most guys so i have to make up with grittiness and show i can work the hardest show im strong on my skates and show i can push some people around
6783593 if they hit me ill drop them i have to play a bit of a physical game and try to work harder than everyone else
6783594 i started pretty young and my first year in novice i was more of a goal scorer after that i didnt have the best hands and then we reached the checking age hitting came into the league i was working out at a young age because i was an enforcer on the team and i ran over guys as i got older i developed more skill i still try to throw big checks in there but i dont want to waste energy there are a few guys who can manhandle me
6783595 im trying to be a responsible player and improve the defensive side of my game the last few years
6783596 i used to take dumb penalties but ive cut down the last few seasons im also working on my offensive game because i want to be a complete player there are so many great young prospects that are going to be complete players if im not a complete player ill be out of the running
6783597 ive been around for a few camps and ive gotten to know the guys
6783598 also i grew up with andy bodnarchuk and there are a lot of guys i played against i played with martins karsums at moncton so i have a lot of good buddies here and im getting to meet the new guys
6783599 there were two teams that i hoped id go to and one was boston bruins scout don matheson coached my dad in juniors he was a scout for moncton and helped bring me there karsums was my linemate there and we played for ex islanders coach ted nolan
6783600 there are so many great young prospects that are going to be complete players if im not a complete player ill be out of the running
6783601 nova scotia hockey is definitely on the upswing with guys like minnesota wild and stephen dixon possibly coming up this year with anaheim
6783602 i played in two world juniors for canada andy bodnarchuk is doing well with the bruins im excited about whats been happening the hockey organizations are expanding and were developing a bigger and better variety of players because there are more developmental teams that can bring a player to the next level were tying to put nova scotia on the hockey map
6783603 my family has had a huge impact on me and my career
6783604 my parents my brother jeff my sister all my relatives call me and congratulate and cheer me on my dad kevin helped me a lot with my game and coached me when i was younger he targets what i need to fix and i work on it to be the best wherever i go
6783605 bodnarchuk i wasnt too happy when he showed up because i always wanted to be the best hockey player in the neighborhood
6783606 ryan hillier and i were always competing and battling and then andy showed up in grade 7
6783607 if you told me at the beginning of the year that i would score 50 goals i probably would have laughed
6783608 but as the season progressed and it became reality i stayed focused and confident the whole season
6783609 i just wanted to play the same way the same style
6783610 i knew i would be successful but how successfully showed through my statistics i tried to play a simple game play the same way every night
6783611 he dedicated himself to training hard and dropped weight and really got himself into really good physical condition
6783612 now you talk to the icedogs coaching staff he sets an unbelievable example for the rest of the team hes a workaholic
6783613 that was the main factor when i first came to junior from aaa
6783614 i was probably around 220 pounds but it was all baby fat none of it was good i learned very quickly in my first ohl camp and my first coach greg gilbert said youre not going to be a good hockey player with that weight and conditioning
6783615 in the last two years hes seen guys he played with being drafted
6783616 we had on our team the one year patrick osullivan and he had great habits on ice and off ice another guy we had was daniel carcillo and he was the same thing days off hed be skating hed be one of the hardest workers in the gym hed see the guys working and think if i want to get to the national hockey league i have to pay attention to off ice training
6783617 youd like to think a kid is always going to have a jump in production year after year so i did expect a jump
6783618 but i didnt think hed be a 50 goal scorer in the ohl we saw some intriguing qualities we saw he could put the puck in the net i did some homework on him and if you go back in the past he had been a scorer in minor hockey so he has run numbers in the past it didnt surprise me his production increased but not that much
6783619 he could always score goals ive seen him first hand as he played minor hockey goal scorers never really lose their touch and he proved it
6783620 he always was around the puck or always 6 10 feet from a teammate for support out number guys
6783621 when im breaking out im down low wheres my centerman wheres their defenseman pinching however he did it he displayed to me great hockey sense and to me thats something you cant teach
6783622 i think luca has his head is screwed on right
6783623 he sets goals but his goals are team oriented his goals were to take his team to the memorial cup if i can and earn myself an nhl contract and i thought this was great it was all team oriented which in turn would help him reach his goal of getting an nhl contract
6783624 you have to believe in yourself and believe you can do it and trust yourself that you can do it
6783625 this summer i worked to get stronger and i put myself on a high carbohydrate diet so my caloric intake would be higher but i could still work out
6783626 im at 198 now i did a body fat test last week and i was at 8 9 im pretty lean and pretty happy right now
6783627 i think thats why you have training camp its an open tryout
6783628 if he comes into camp and plays hard plays smart plays the way hes capable of playing he puts himself in a position to be successful and move up the professional totem pole
6783629 larger percentage of patients treated with vytorin were diagnosed with and died from all types of cancer combined when compared to treatment with a placebo
6783630 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6783631 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6783632 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6783633 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6783634 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6783635 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6783636 its amazing after years of coaching you look in the paper and it doesnt say anything about wanted coach with 25 years experience
6783637 theres not too many of those jobs available i was starting to get a little worried but fortunately ive landed in a very good situation with some outstanding people im relieved and excited
6783638 art is a legitimate heavyweight who doesnt back down from anything
6783639 you obviously cant coach size but he also has all the tools to be a very good hockey player arts physical presence should help him be the kind of player fans grow to love and appreciate
6783640 bob ferguson did a fine job there which should make the transition a lot easier for me
6783641 we were able to sit down together and go over the personnel that was there he had some players that he had been recruiting that i had been recruiting in pensacola theyre happy to be coming to augusta
6783642 had i been hired a little earlier i would have had a couple of other guys that were bigger keys to our team in the second half of the season i guess our players that we had in the second half werent that bad after all because it didnt take long for about six or seven of them to get snapped up
6783643 i was starting to get a little worried but fortunately ive landed in a very good situation with some outstanding people im relieved and excited
6783644 thats what this league is for over the years ive had a ton of guys called up and ive never said no ive never said no to any general manager thats ever called me for a player thats what the leagues all about i look at it as a positive a young mans getting promoted and he knows and the team knows youre promoting him i think it helps in recruiting in the long run anybody who says no is just slitting their own throat
6783645 i had a good friend of mine who had me all lined up to drive a truck when they started harvesting the corn up here and the sugar beets and the potatoes
6783646 si vemos los plazos nos dieron carnita de aqu a las elecciones y m s entonces todo mundo le va a buscar raja pol tica coment el periodista
6783647 no es ninguna conclusi n graciosa lo que est n haciendo simplemente est n reconociendo que no cumplieron con su trabajo y esperemos que ahora lo cumplan porque adem s ya hay una especie de empoderamiento social

6783652 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
6783653 ive never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of gatorade
6783654 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6783655 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6783656 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it
6783657 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample
6783658 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6783659 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6783660 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6783661 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6783662 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6783663 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6783664 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6783665 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6783666 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6783667 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6783668 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6783669 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6783670 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6783671 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6783672 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6783673 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6783674 sa sarim in lateral cand cobora astia sa nu ne vada sau mai bine sa ne facem ca coboram mai incet ca ei
6783675 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6783676 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6783677 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6783678 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6783679 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6783680 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6783681 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6783682 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6783683 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6783684 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6783685 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6783686 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6783687 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6783688 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6783689 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6783690 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6783691 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6783692 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6783693 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6783694 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6783695 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6783696 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6783697 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6783698 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6783699 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6783700 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6783701 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6783702 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6783703 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6783704 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6783705 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6783706 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6783707 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6783708 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6783709 i got into my moms makeup and didnt know what to do next
6783710 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6783711 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6783712 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6783713 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6783714 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6783715 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6783716 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6783717 who are the next big things in rock or alternate music
6783718 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6783719 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6783720 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6783721 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6783722 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6783723 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6783724 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6783725 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6783726 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6783727 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6783728 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6783729 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6783730 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6783731 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6783732 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6783733 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6783734 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6783735 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6783736 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6783737 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6783738 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6783739 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6783740 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6783741 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6783742 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6783743 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6783744 yo esperar a que despu s de esto hubiera acciones inmediatas que si bien no van a verse de manera tan r pida por lo menos se vea que ya hay una consecuencia de esta reuni n que se empiezan a movilizar las distintas fuerzas del estado que la ciudadan a vea que no s lo hubo buenos discursos
6783745 formar una nueva generaci n con nuevos criterios de capacitaci n eso me parece que es de lo m s destacable al igual que la regulaci n de los tel fonos celulares que se han convertido en una herramienta del crimen destacable tambi n es el discurso de ebrard de su compromiso de renunciar si no se logra abatir la inseguridad en la ciudad la ciudadan a espera m s compromisos de ese nivel
6783746 ir mostrando metas concretas y que la ciudadan a vaya sintiendo que se est combatiendo de manera distinta a la inseguridad
6783747 who are the next big things in rock or alternate music
6783748 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6783749 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6783750 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6783751 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6783752 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6783753 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6783754 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6783755 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6783756 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6783757 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6783758 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6783759 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6783760 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6783761 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6783762 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6783763 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6783764 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6783765 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6783766 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6783767 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6783768 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6783769 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6783770 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6783771 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6783772 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6783773 der markt bertrifft sich mittlerweile an negativen schlagzeilen und worst case szenarien wieder selbst solange keine stabilisierung der immobilienpreise in sicht ist m ssen wir mit negativ meldungen weiterleben
6783774 in san francisco hat technikchef justin rattner in der nacht auf heute freitag einen ausblick auf zukunftstechnologien aus den forschungslabors gegeben
6783775 das ist der interessanteste punkt f r mich eine erreichte effizienz von 75 prozent bei drahtloser bertragung ber die distanz von einem meter nicht einmal das akkupack eines laptops kann mit derartiger effizienz aufwarten
6783776 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6783777 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6783778 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6783779 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6783780 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills

6783783 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6783784 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6783785 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6783786 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6783787 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6783788 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6783789 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6783790 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6783791 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6783792 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6783793 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6783794 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6783795 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6783796 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6783797 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6783798 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6783799 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6783800 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6783801 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6783802 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6783803 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6783804 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6783805 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6783806 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6783807 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6783808 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6783809 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6783810 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6783811 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6783812 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6783813 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6783814 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6783815 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6783816 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6783817 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6783818 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6783819 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6783820 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6783821 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6783822 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6783823 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6783824 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6783825 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6783826 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6783827 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6783828 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6783829 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6783830 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6783831 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6783832 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6783833 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6783834 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6783835 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6783836 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6783837 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6783838 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6783839 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6783840 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6783841 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6783842 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6783843 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6783844 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6783845 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6783846 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6783847 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6783848 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6783849 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6783850 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6783851 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6783852 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6783853 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6783854 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6783855 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6783856 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6783857 i do despair sometimes about what is written about us and ive been saying it for 18 months but it doesnt seem to make any difference
6783858 if someone had just made a phone call they would have discovered that the boy played
6783859 he came over he played on tuesday in a reserve game arranged with qpr a week before that for james collins to play in
6783860 he played we didnt fancy it and hes gone back
6783861 we just had to take stock and see if we can improve our fortunes and what wed need to do
6783862 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6783863 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6783864 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6783865 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6783866 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6783867 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6783868 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6783869 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6783870 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6783871 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6783872 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6783873 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6783874 hes trained with us for the past two days and im going to put him on the bench on saturday
6783875 were hopeful we will see the best of joaquin in a relaxing atmosphere so we will be able to speak about this contract extension
6783876 besides joaquin is pretty much involved in our project as a consequence the only viable option right now is that he carries on with us and we are delighted with it
6783877 emery is the best person to help him bounce back to help him be the right winger everybody wants to watch because he is a one of the best in the world
6783878 i know i have a lot of people to prove wrong because i didnt do as well as i could have up there
6783879 at dundee united i did all right in the first game but i didnt think my fitness levels were right up
6783880 then when i did get back in i was trying too hard to impress rather than concentrating on my own game
6783881 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6783882 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6783883 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6783884 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6783885 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6783886 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6783887 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6783888 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6783889 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6783890 the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people
6783891 by burning fossil fuels man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century
6783892 from a science to a religion and noted that research money is being funneled into promoting climate alarmism instead of funding areas he considers more worthy
6783893 if you funnel money into things that cant be changed the money is not going into the places that it is needed he said
6783894 solar activity can explain a large part of the 20th century global warming
6783895 it is unlikely that the solar climate link does not exist shaviv noted pointing to the impact cosmic rays have on the atmosphere
6783896 if back in the mid 1990s we knew what we know today about climate kyoto would almost certainly not exist because we would have concluded it was not necessary
6783897 when i go to a scientific meeting theres lots of opinion out there theres lots of discussion about climate change
6783898 but if you listen to canadian environmental activist david suzuki and the media its like a tiger chasing its tail they try to outdo each other and all the while proclaiming that the debate is over but it isnt come out to a scientific meeting sometime patterson said in a separate interview on april 26 2007 with a canadian newspaper patterson explained that the scientific proof favors skeptics i think the proof in the pudding based on what media and governments are saying is were about three quarters of the way to disaster with the doubling of co2 in the atmosphere
6783899 it may be many years yet before we properly understand the earths climate system nevertheless significant advances have been made since the protocol was created many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases
6783900 climate catastrophe cancelled what youre not being told about the science of climate change
6783901 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
6783902 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
6783903 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
6783904 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
6783905 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
6783906 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
6783907 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
6783908 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6783909 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6783910 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6783911 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6783912 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6783913 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6783914 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6783915 perch avremo dimostrato che gente comune con mezzi normali pu fare tanto per i palestinesi
6783916 ma di fatto questa missione aiuta il regime di unorganizzazione terroristica come hamas
6783917 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6783918 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6783919 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6783920 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6783921 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6783922 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6783923 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6783924 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6783925 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6783926 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6783927 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
6783928 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
6783929 you just gotta listen to the words and get what you can get out of it
6783930 people are now talking about the same idea in the same language
6783931 that is a great advancement compared with the beginning of this year
6783932 the private sector will have an important role to play
6783933 climate change is blurring the distinction between natural and man made hazards
6783934 and the consensus among experts is that we are to blame
6783935 to chupas watching goats is like humans watching television it is sheer entertainment
6783936 the marfa lights are unexplained lights known as ghost lights usually seen near u s route 67 on mitchell flat east of marfa texas
6783937 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
6783938 yesterday i heard sen mccain say we are all georgians now well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
6783939 his life is destroyed so why hound gary glitter gt deborah orr you can read more of our emails in this post but what do you think
6783940 perhaps you can break the mould of reporting and commenting on paul gadds imminent return to these shores hes being villified as an evil devious nonce which he surely is by all and sundry including the tabloids and radio 4s various news bulletins but its not getting us anywhere we alll knew this years ago since he took his hard drive into pc world on cribbs causeway wouldnt it foster better understanding of his predicament to suggest he needs help for a serious illness most people have very little understanding about paedophilia and its causes cant you haul a leading expert onto your programme tonight to suggest how he could be helped even if he cant be cured
6783941 why does the media feel it is necessary to spend so much airtime on this peadophile as opposed to all the other peadophiles in the uk
6783942 you know what they say about minorities he says white guy to white guy i guess
6783943 the last model falcon was 45 per cent foreign components the new one is 55 per cent its only a matter of time
6783944 both mr rudd and senator obama agreed australia and the united states would need to work closely to help shape the future global agenda in each of those areas
6783945 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death
6783946 it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat it was absolutely disgusting
6783947 she was clearly still alive she was clearly moving the line was thrashing
6783948 shes died a starving death over four days and over that period of time no one even attempted to feed the whale
6783949 this type of violent attack on a defenceless young man is deplorable and must be discouraged
6783950 it says to these thugs that you can go out and bash someone to a pulp come to court and say youre sorry and well give you a bond
6783951 these guys are street smart our system is so slack that it doesnt have the guts to hand out a just sentence
6783952 ajang told me he does not want these people to go to jail
6783953 he has been hiding because people have been in contact with him
6783954 hes changed his phone number hes moved his address and changed schools
6783955 it was good to finally get out on the new valencia street circuit today after previously experiencing the lap on the simulator and having a closer look during our track walk yesterday
6783956 we were struggling with very low grip this morning and im sure that was the same for everyone out there the track is very dusty and if you go offline your tyres are quickly covered in dirt which makes it difficult to be consistent we made a lot of changes to the car this afternoon which have proved positive and provided a great deal of useful information to study this evening it was nice to do a quick lap at the end on the option tyre hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6783957 the new circuit here in valencia is impressive and the grip levels have been improving throughout the day so the lap times are becoming more representative we had a good morning session and i felt the car was quite well balanced but this afternoon it was almost like i had a completely different car we changed some parts for the session and unfortunately they had a real impact on the cars performance which along with some braking concerns meant that we were unable to progress im confident that we can resolve these concerns overnight and get back on the pace for qualifying tomorrow
6783958 the track is very dirty as it is so new and its very easy to lose a bit of direction as the track improves the car balance changes and the tyres behave differently
6783959 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
6783960 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
6783961 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
6783962 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
6783963 maddow in abrams out as msnbc moves decisively to the left
6783964 not everyone is approaching everything in this campaign from a right vs left perspective stop trying to force everything into that tired old way of looking at american politics
6783965 wants to tightly control how politics is discussed on her site
6783966 eat the press at the huffington post but it was determined that the post was not
6783967 is absolutely disgraceful and speaks volumes about the political patronage still being doled out by the current administration
6783968 i pulled out on to the road i never meant to harm a soul i really didnt unfortunately i have taken a ladys life because of my stupid actions
6783969 words cannot adequately convey the tragic impact of your conduct on the lives of innocent people
6783970 i lost a child and they lost a mother they have to grow up without knowing their mother especially matthias
6783971 matthias will never know his mother that is the saddest thing of all
6783972 i have to live with it the kids have to live with it we are trying to do our best i am going to do my best for my grandchildren
6783973 the interview was all about his inspiring road to recovery
6783974 graham accepted the request of the reporter and invited the newspaper into his home to conduct the interview
6783975 the decision not to publish the article was clearly in the best interests of grahams recovery
6783976 we are in an extraordinary period in the global economy
6783977 weve got the worst set of circumstances in over 25 years
6783978 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses
6783979 the extraordinary thing about this is john brumby obviously knew this announcement was going to be made
6783980 the motor car industry especially in victoria has still got a very good future
6783981 we are part of a global aerospace chain and need to remain globally competitive
6783982 because we need the space at the factory for that we are sending a lot of non 787 work to hawker de havilland bankstown
6783983 this is a not a company that has lost contracts this is a company that has actively decided to send the contracts they have to the us and nsw
6783984 police swear all the time so the idea they could be offended by others is unlikely these days
6783985 the ground is shifting and police are probably aware that it is to the annoyance of a judge if they tried to rest a case on swearing alone
6783986 with the advent of the f word in prime time television we have become desensitised to its shock value and as a result police are taking it much less seriously on the streets
6783987 its a general sign that as a society we are becoming more crass and insensitive towards one another
6783988 its on a level with what you would hear on a sports field in a work place or a school ground
6783989 we are confident these standards reflect those of the community
6783990 youre more likely to get a reaction saying somebody is fat than saying they are a f wit

6783992 you do have a good guy joe molinari molinaro molinari was the previous one molinaro is the bald headed one thats how i tell he and i share the same problem
6783993 they do bring a local attention to problems that a citywide office like the mayor maybe cant do
6783994 if you didnt have them you might have more employees at the mayors level so i dont know that it is fair to say they cost you a lot of money
6783995 if god said to me you can keep them or get rid of them id keep them
6783996 this summer we had to turn down children because we just dont have the facilities
6783997 we hope to have a shovel in the ground this fall but we still have a host of administrative hurdles to clear so it may be next spring before we break ground
6783998 an integrated ministry that gives attention to both body and spirit
6783999 he said we will be able to tell the homosexuals by the way they dress and the way they walk
6784000 somehow it got out that we didnt want tourists in the castro at all
6784001 of course that is not the case what doesnt help the situation is unloading mobs of people with cameras who only want to gawk
6784002 this time they bought bananas yogurt they bought a lot i almost cried
6784003 if they dont buy so what my brother is crazy
6784004 i know other people have the feeling that people are here to gawk at them
6784005 i definitely notice the crowd but it doesnt bother me
6784006 i dont know if i feel any different about this than any other neighborhood
6784007 right now there isnt any place to get a sense of the history the controversies and the achievements of the community
6784008 it will give a lot of hope to people who are in prison that if they work very hard to rehabilitate themselves and can demonstrate that they have done so they have hope of being released
6784009 the court explained that public safety is the paramount consideration
6784010 you dont want to get in peoples lives and then have to leave
6784011 we can have a special election i prefer to put it on this ballot but you always have to go for the next best thing you cant always have it exactly your way
6784012 im optimistic that we will pass a budget in time for this election
6784013 willing to stay as long as it takes to get the right responsible kind of budget for california
6784014 i think we all could very quickly be on the same page if i would want to fix the budget problem only for this year and kick the problem down to next year but is that what i want no
6784015 republicans in the legislature have no interest in thinking long term
6784016 heres a chance to go to the democrats and say look youve never been for budget reform why dont you give us budget reform and in exchange we do a temporary sales tax increase it could work
6784017 when you travel around the world you see the rest of the world building building and building and cranes everywhere i want to see that in california rather than mickey mousing around with all this nonsense and arguing about the budget
6784018 we can have a budget system in place so that we dont have to argue about the budget all the time then debate about the big things
6784019 at around seven hours i puked because i had ingested so much salt water
6784020 i was like what and when he asked me if i wanted to keep going for a bit i said yes
6784021 the last half an hour was horrible i was crying in my goggles and trying to swim as fast as possible despite the waves i kept hoping that if i swam faster and kept going i would be able to make it
6784022 whatever i do i know that i will have my family and friends to support me
6784023 als dat zo blijft zullen straks enkele spelers naar kleedkamer twee moeten kleedkamer n is namelijk vol er kunnen er 25 in en ik kan de spelers moeilijk bovenop elkaar stapelen
6784024 it is bad enough to be informed that there will continue to be delays even after the introduction of a barrier free toll system but to also discover that businesses will be charged up to 46 per cent more for these tolls at a time when business costs are already going through the roof is unacceptable
6784025 i was waiting for this day and finally i see the russians leaving my home town
6784026 they have a proposal for what they call a phoenix fund which is somewhere between 1 billion and 2 billion
6784027 thats really reconstruction its for infrastructure its not just because of hostilities its for development
6784028 my father was ailing in chicago my wife is pregnant and i bought a house with an 18 5 percent mortgage
6784029 my wife stops working to have our first child we have this huge mortgage the journal folds in december and im out of work
6784030 they wanted to know if id come back to chicago
6784031 neither one of them knew chicago but i grew up there they offered me a great opportunity because my dad was in the hospital and my mother didnt drive a car it turned my life around at that moment
6784032 after the 84 season dallas wanted me to get more involved in issues such as salary arbitration
6784033 dallas opened the door and i started learning baseball rules and all the other things gms must know that allowed me to concentrate more on a career path than survival
6784034 one of the reasons we were aggressive in getting casey blake and manny ramirez is because when you see a team thats fought off injuries all season it deserves all the help you can give it
6784035 jeff kent plays as hard he can every day at 40 years old in the middle of the infield
6784036 when you see that day to day and you get to the end of july its incumbent upon the ownership and baseball operations to give your team a boost
6784037 when somebody walks into the clubhouse the players look around and say we just got better we did that with casey and a week later here comes manny and now we bring in maddux who helped us get to the playoffs in 2006
6784038 dodger stadium is as electric as any time since ive been here
6784039 starting with mannys first game hes got a certain cache he brings along with his great ability people here were drawn to it immediately its been exciting hes produced which is obviously the main criteria but hes got the personality to add to it in a city like this and in this market
6784040 he only pitches every fifth day but he has value to an organization every day
6784041 ive been fortunate to know him since his first day in the big leagues even at a very young age for a player the way his mind works is unique what he remembers and what he thinks about pitching and competing he will be a enormous help to our young players
6784042 every day he spends around those guys will help them we have some good young pitching here cory wade chad billingsley clayton kershaw jonathan broxton and some others it might not help them today it may be a year from now or five years from now but hell end up imparting some piece of knowledge or multiple pieces of knowledge that they will carry with them throughout their entire careers

6784060 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6784061 started dating sharon stone and shes pretty good for 50
6784062 sharon called him and he showed the caller id to everyone shes really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
6784063 theres as much likelihood of that happening as there being commercial space flights
6784064 it was both fun and horrible its like having a girlfriend that you have always been in love with and youll always be in love with but you dont quite get along with
6784065 youre still in love with her and every time you get together you end up throwing food at each other
6784066 it was definitely was not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation travelling in the caribbean
6784067 the key to success in biofuels is how much biomass you can grow and how quickly
6784068 for biofuels production were talking about a rotation length of less than 10 years not the 15 to 30 years as for other wood products
6784069 maybe the reduced lignin content of the wood will be less important for these short growth cycles compared to trees that live for longer periods of time
6784070 this could be a big thing for rural areas especially in north carolina where more than 60 percent of rural land is forest
6784071 theres no silver bullet to solve the energy problem but these trees could be an added product for rural communities

6784081 der morgen war nicht gut aber wir haben am setup gearbeitet und f r den nachmittag ein paar verbesserungen vorgenommen lasst uns einmal schauen was wir morgen erreichen k nnen
6784082 i was sitting on the lounge when i heard this huge bang
6784083 i thought it had gone straight into the house i rushed to the window and saw them take off really quick i only just had time to get their rego
6784084 my car was my pride and joy there wasnt a scratch on it
6784085 i had put 60 000 into that car and these guys only had it for 15 minutes and they wrote it off it makes you wonder how many other cars they have taken out for joy rides
6784086 whenever a nice car came in they were all itching to take it for a drive
6784087 i saw them do burn outs speed and drive erratically on test drives and their attitude was its not my car
6784088 they have just told me a lot of lies at first it had been side swiped then they had swerved to miss a car and finally they said they had tried to dodge a runaway dog
6784089 any time a vehicle is on the road it is at risk of being involved in an accident
6784090 i was sitting on the lounge when i heard this huge bang
6784091 it was inhumane the whale was struggling so much it dragged the boats about 50m
6784092 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell its been separated from its mother and it is confused i have never seen anything like this
6784093 it has been a comedy of errors all week and i cant understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6784094 they gave the animal the end you would want to give your cat or dog
6784095 so we can draw on the best knowledge there is
6784096 go down to a nice waterhole throw down the swag have a quiet drink chat
6784097 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy they need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
6784098 these women want my blood they want to kill me
6784099 i just got punched out while waiting for a cab
6784100 go down to a nice waterhole throw down the swag have a quiet drink chat
6784101 the cost of funds in international markets where we raise about a third of our capital is still rising
6784102 if that trend continues and some of our domestic funding costs also rise as we expect then we will not be able to pass on any or all of further rba cuts indeed it is possible that our mortgage rates may start rising even as the cash rate is falling
6784103 people say why cant you just take less profit and give people cheaper mortgages
6784104 but if we did the international credit rating agencies would look at our margins being squeezed and our profits falling and would probably reduce our aa credit rating which in turn would mean wed have to pay more for our funds then wed have to raise mortgage rates again anyway
6784105 our focus has to be on maintaining that financial stability especially in such uncertain times that means our focus has to be on our own costs not on what the rba does if that means that we have to ignore rba cuts then so be it it will be to everybodys benefit in the end
6784106 if the rba was cutting rates and the banks were going in the opposite direction the rba will cut its cash rate to help bring average rates down
6784107 ultimately if the economy needs help with lower rates the rba will do what it takes to deliver those lower rates with a sharply lower cash rate
6784108 it would be cheaper for wayne swan to stand outside coles with gift vouchers
6784109 i think 2 4 million people have looked at it to see how the government has wasted 13 million of taxpayers money
6784110 ive tried to buy companies that i can own for three to four years
6784111 you dont have to be the best fund in a big up year you just have to consistently be in the top quartile
6784112 in a slow economy these bigger companies have trouble growing
6784113 he may have got 20 months my family are doing absolute life for this
6784114 georgia was a beautiful 15 year old girl with a blonde ponytail and full of life
6784115 we have moved these soldiers back to australia to ensure they continue to receive the best medical care available
6784116 while both men have serious injuries they are in good spirits
6784117 qantas would always be australian and would always have the great majority of its jobs and its business in australia
6784118 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6784119 other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6784120 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6784121 it focused on detailed activity but the more you do the better the effect
6784122 thirteen hours a week for the most active woman but there were benefits for all levels of activity
6784123 a number of studies show regular physical activity totalling four or more hours per week reduces the risk for breast cancer in post menopausal women
6784124 there hasnt been a study before into pre menopausal women
6784125 there are a number of theories to explain this reduction in risk including the effect of exercise on reducing a womans exposure to estrogen which is known to play a role in the development of breast cancer
6784126 i go to the gym three times a week and go for a walk every other day
6784127 i do it because i know its good for me and i like to keep fit
6784128 if this goes down he is in a world of trouble i dont know how we could justify not voting for it
6784129 but when it gets torpedoed mr ofarrell will be the one that torpedoed it it will be the end of him
6784130 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6784131 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6784132 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6784133 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6784134 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6784135 i heard a bang and i looked at my left side mirror and what i saw was a trucker was heading right in the middle of the divider i just pulled over cause i saw the truck crash and i saw flames coming out from the bottom of the truck

6784161 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
6784162 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
6784163 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
6784164 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
6784165 the important thing to remember is that the pie gets larger over time and theres more to divide up

6784226 the recent data shows that common childhood vaccines are especially dangerous to children with a strong family history of diabetes

6784241 my sin in the eyes of the nationalists and the anti semites in the lithuanian government
6784242 was that i was a partisan and fought against the nazis and their collaborators
6784243 i wrote a book about the war and in it i mentioned in a few lines that i had heard from partisan friends about the attack
6784244 to date lithuanian governments have not punished a single lithuanian war criminal in spite of our considerable efforts and the large amount of information we have given them they handled three cases with astonishing slowness not one of the three served a single day in prison on the other hand theyre not ashamed to persecute and harass lithuanian partisans who fought the nazis what is common to all these cases is that theyre all jews instead of punishing lithuanian criminals who collaborated with the nazis and murdered jews theyre harassing the partisans jewish heroes
6784245 in the state of israel they prefer to let jewish organizations do the dirty work and fight against the rewriting of history in lithuania
6784246 the state of israel and those involved in the issue should have made it unequivocally clear to the lithuanian government that it is crossing all the red lines

6784256 in international rugby you need that maybe that unpredictability has been something that has been missing from england over the last few years
6784257 defences are so tight nowadays that you need something different
6784258 that unpredictability was there against ireland in the six nations but obviously we need to do more work in this area
6784259 were looking for three more players to come in before the deadline but theyve got to be the right players
6784260 we definitely need one more defender theres no doubt about that
6784261 theres coloccini who can play right left back centre back and holding midfield so if we get another defender then certainly he becomes a very important player for us

6784282 thunder bay and saint john are the first of what we expect will be many canadian organizations to use ise for scheduling and managing their public safety
6784283 ise is designed to help public safety administrators be more efficient and productive in their scheduling work while also helping track manage and automate overtime and other costs and keep them under control
6784284 ise provides administrators not only with the ability to track ot costs in real time but also to easily develop
6784285 the other big benefit is being able to quickly track costs for a particular event and then easily bill these back to the event organizers whether its another city department or a festival organizer ise makes all this administrative work much more efficient and cost effective

6784292 hes never won a listed race or a group race and now hes won a group one
6784293 hes been chinned in the stewards cup but he always gives his all
6784294 i think hes better over five furlongs to be honest
6784295 ive got to give credit to my son and daughter as they train the horses now i said to them if i win a group one ill probably hand it his licence over because i cant do any more
6784296 i think he would be aborting his own campaign because that is such a critical issue to so many republican voters and the republican brand is already in trouble
6784297 if he doesnt change the platform then hes being the same kind of hypocrite that he accused bush of being in 2000
6784298 is being touted by the media as a man of principle yet he was involved with other women while married to his first wife and was implicated in the so called keating scandal with four other senators he was eventually reprimanded by the congress for the appearance of impropriety the senator reportedly has a violent temper and can be extremely confrontational and profane when angry these red flags about senator mccains character are reminiscent of the man who now occupies the white house
6784299 we dont want anybody to move out of west bengal but at the same time we will not bow to any kind of pressure
6784300 in principle we would like ratan tata to concede to our demand for the return of 400 acres forcibly taken away from unwilling farmers
6784301 its such a text that you cant change it i have certain suggestions or certain interpretations i have been keeping the play intact and i have been breaking the play at several places besides this i have been adding my own ideas into it the play is intact but its not a play nor is it a transitional play it is a pure film i have been throwing all these scenes on it through vast locations
6784302 i think they wanted the producers of this film the sort of sensibility which i had in the films titanic and shall we dance the sorts of scoring that i was doing in those movies which people are familiar in here in india so i think it wont be as big shock as some people thought it will be but yes it has a different approach
6784303 my association with three ladies actress in the film is very strange in the film this character mohanlals character in the film has got very strange ideas because he loves to make things very big he is renowned architect so its a passion and its a creation so this man lives in a different plane so he reacts with these ladies in different planes
6784304 wolfe island is a very small municipality with only 1 100 full time residents and about 3 000 in the summer
6784305 weve seen significant changes over the years and now have very little employment on the island we have become a community of commuters but we are still in denial i think its safe to say we are yearning for the good old days with economic opportunities for our youth
6784306 i want to make sure that if they go up they are put up in a responsible manner
6784307 we have built a 100 million tourism industry and that will plummet if they are put up just anywhere i have a lot of friends who visit from places like toronto and montreal and i can tell you they dont want to come here to look at wind turbines
6784308 i can tell you this if you go ahead with projects here you will be changing council during the course of them

6784331 everyone at the sustainable brands conference in monterey was talking about the speech given by eric ryan brand architect of method an eco friendly home products company which is growing very fast in the usa method is a good example of the amazing proliferation of us based companies offering a vast array of new eco products everything from recyclable dry cleaning hangers to solar powered mobile phone chargers the home product range in particular appears to be undergoing a green revolution in the us in a way which is not so apparent i believe in europe here is eric talking to me about methods mission of engaging consumers who have never used eco products before by focusing on good product design safety efficacy and fragrance as well as the environment id call that a true blue ocean strategy

6784341 weve been coming here for years when the weather is nice to feed the ducks and the geese they practically take the food out of your hand what kind of a person would want to poison birds
6784342 i think our staff is cognizant to the circumstances surrounding this incident although weve turned the investigation over to the police
6784343 feeding the ducks is part of the nice ambience of confederation basin and even though there are complaints from people who have to clean up the dung from them they are a part of the area
6784344 ive never seen anything like this in all the years ive been in this job
6784345 this agreement further solidifies the great relationship we have with major league baseball and together with our television deal allows us to bring the game of baseball to more fans than ever before our goal is always to deliver sports to fans across any platform and this is yet another agreement that fulfills that strategy
6784346 emergents action is poised to support this growing market who truly embraces the idea that there is no such thing as a small game
6784347 especially suited to the casual market where downloads need to be small
6784348 emergent is looking to take the casual game industry beyond what is possible today
6784349 we see a future where short format games have the same level of graphics interactivity and gameplay as big budget releases to get there casual developers will need the same world class tools and support that aaa titles can afford today
6784350 over the past several years weve been helping our customers get online with the latest computers
6784351 value choice and convenience are very important to our customers and apples popular desktop computer the imac should prove to be another great option for our atlantic canadian customers
6784352 i write to register my concern at an order made by chichester magistrates
6784353 the order purports to prohibit publication of anything which would identify the defendant in this case
6784354 it is submitted that the order is plainly unlawful that it should not have been imposed by the court and that the court should therefore reconvene so that it can overturn the order
6784355 there had been a similar program done at another art school we visited
6784356 it goes to develop the arts focus and really implement it
6784357 even before i knew this was our home school i applied for a transfer
6784358 just with all the cutbacks we could help out in any way
6784359 my son cant wait to come to school and i hope that never goes away
6784360 weve been very smart with our resources and been able to do a lot with a little
6784361 well appoint an interim advisory group to start an audit of our sporting infrastructure and develop a framework for the bid process
6784362 runs together with our support for a world class stadium
6784363 in 1990 sa started work on a bid for the 1998 games
6784364 we had a bid committee and a board that put together proposals for accommodation sporting facilities and transport and tourism facilities
6784365 from march 2010 we will begin that process again culminating in a decision at the end of 2011 by the commonwealth games federation
6784366 this will begin the regeneration of our tourism industry and provide a sporting heritage for our young people to build on
6784367 as part of this process we will need to complete an audit of our sporting infrastructure and i call on the rann government to begin that process
6784368 regardless of their actions we will start that process while in opposition
6784369 does that mean you are not going to prescribe me anything for pain
6784370 i think were able to compete at the level that this team needs us to compete at
6784371 im not going to say were randy moss or anything like that but were the guys that we are and the guys that were going with and we feel confident and everybody in this locker room feels confident with the guys that we put on the field each and every game
6784372 im kind of one of those guys that just goes into things with an open mind and whatever happens happens
6784373 i know what im capable of doing and all the hard work ive put in i just cant wait to get in there
6784374 i dont see it as we have to make up anything
6784375 last year was last year this is a brand new year nobody has any yards anywhere so if we just come out and do what we need to do i think the offense will continue to flourish as it did were not feeling any pressure we just want to go out and make plays and make the most of each opportunity
6784376 first game starting in the nfl im just hoping to get out there and hopefully make a great impression
6784377 from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds
6784378 a lot of that credit has to go with gene and what he stood for he stood his ground on a lot of key issues with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with the presidents at the time be it troy vincent or trace armstrong they worked to get us in a very good position and hes left us in a very good position
6784379 whether it was as a hall of fame offensive lineman with the oakland raiders or as executive director of the nfl players association gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person
6784380 gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans
6784381 it will give the community and the school district and the city time to evaluate everybodys rights obligations and options
6784382 we just have far too many cars on campus and we were going to have to look at putting in another parking lot
6784383 we were able to siphon about 500 gallons from downed buses
6784384 i think well see 5 a gallon gas next year
6784385 theres not a whole lot more we can do were pretty streamlined

6784389 this was a tragic case it is clear from our investigation that ms whiteley had a number of issues in her life and had spiralled into depression
6784390 the officers who dealt with her on several occasions leading up to her death were placed in a difficult situation police officers are not healthcare professionals and they had to make judgement calls with regard to each situation they encountered
6784391 in hindsight it is almost certainly the case that opportunities for intervention were missed which might have led to ms whiteley receiving medical assistance however it is obvious that ms whiteleys thoughts of self harm had escalated in the months prior to her death and it can never be said whether such intervention would have changed or stopped the tragic course of events
6784392 were trying to make the railfest more of a community event
6784393 earlier in the day it was reported that witnesses thought it was about 1 p m when a male person no description was observed dumping stuff from a bucket into the water
6784394 the ministry of the environment determined that there was no danger to people
6784395 this is the first time ive ever seen anything as large as this over a single poisoning
6784396 were not sure at this point if the feed that was left behind was poisoned or if it was something else
6784397 we want an answer as quickly as possible so if an investigation has to be done we can immediately get one underway
6784398 until we have answers i would definitely direct all members of the public to keep their animals as far away from that area around confederation basins shoreline as possible
6784399 we dont want anything else becoming ill until we know what is going on down there we wont know if it can be transferred to domesticated animals
6784400 staff did go out to check the water and the site and there was no evidence of a sheen odours or residual material in the water at the time
6784401 they also noted that there was a large number of fish that appeared healthy in the water
6784402 based on information that we have at this point theres a strong suspicion that the ducks that died on tuesday may have been poisoned
6784403 we are appealing to anyone with any information about this robbery to come forward and contact police
6784404 i would be particularly interested to speaking to anyone who saw the robbery itself or noticed anybody acting strangely around talbot square either today or in the days leading up to the incident
6784405 i spare you the twists and turns of my cogitations for no conclusion was found on the road to headingly and i ask you to suppose that i soon found out my mistake about the turning and retraced my steps to fernham
6784406 but dont worry its not like we will be taking the hardrive out or anything
6784407 i was going to play every instrument bass guitar keyboard i could dance and i could sing i was going to be princes protege
6784408 my goal was to get her something of my own
6784409 a 45 on my own label i had 1 000 records made up and sold about 950 one went to her then i waited for the call
6784410 i was so scared i just couldnt imagine living without singing
6784411 i just thought i would take the baby with me wherever i performed
6784412 i loved my daughter but i had to sing not only did i love it but i had to make money i didnt want to live on public assistance
6784413 when i was little i was always with my dad instead of my mom
6784414 my mom thought he was more mature he was five years older than she was
6784415 i know she was doing what she had to do
6784416 it lasted a couple of years everyone in the band was great friends and i met michael
6784417 i was the mother of three i gave up thinking i was going to be princes protege
6784418 when i was singing in the bars i wouldnt leave the house until 9 or 9 30 and by that time my kids were in bed we would do four 40 minute sets on fridays and saturdays it wasnt enough to live on but i was home with the kids the rest of the time
6784419 church made me happy but i was missing that one thing
6784420 im proud of my kids and i still get to sing
6784421 i want to shop the cd around to a few different labels
6784422 when my mom plays out my dad usually stays home with me
6784423 after they had me and ashton dad didnt really play out anymore
6784424 we would go out for two weeks and come back home then go out and come back
6784425 we knew dale was going to have to get a real job he knew we had to have insurance and an income that was coming in every week
6784426 i had a hard time leaving to go out of state
6784427 the other members didnt have kids they had more freedom i didnt but it didnt really matter it fell apart
6784428 but i was still trying to make it i just didnt want to give up my dream
6784429 i knew i had to have something that would help pay bills
6784430 heres the logic flash audio is embedded inside flash unless aircell wants to block all flash traffic this is the way to talk
6784431 i was getting stares right and left in the 5 minutes i was talking to andy and i dont blame the passengers of american airlines at all granted i was talking really loudly without a headset but loud talkers on a plane and in general are annoying the poor girl next to me was trying to sleep other than the call i havent bothered her once though she thinks i am a total geek
6784432 if youd never been born well what would you be you might be a fish or a toad in a tree you might be a door knob or three baked potatoes you might be a bag full of hard green tomatoes or worse than all that why you might be a wasnt a wasnt has no fun at all no he doesnt a wasnt just isnt he just isnt present but you you are you and now isnt that pleasant
6784433 yes giving someone you dont entirely trust access to personal information is a safety issue
6784434 if people in your network can post and view photos and funny comments about you its best to restrict access to people who are truly your friends
6784435 if its someone you see too frequently to just ignore the request simply tell her that you try to keep a low profile on networking sites and leave it at that
6784436 we are looking at something but if it doesnt come off then we will carry on as we are
6784437 hes proved himself as a centre back and it was purely a choice the england manager had to make
6784438 manchester city came on the scene and he was half way through a medical with them when he got a phone call and went to arsenal
6784439 sometimes i think about moving out to hawaii mainly so i can watch you at one am and get a decent amount of sleep
6784440 im going to be president but i think its going to be of something like the eagan rotary club
6784441 theres an admission that there was a problem with the legislation
6784442 the situation that occurred then hopefully wont occur again in another project
6784443 it doesnt do anything to save red hill valley or the escarpment having a huge hole blasted in it
6784444 if they had responded then that would have allowed us to have potentially challenged it in court
6784445 i guess they figured the best of of dealing with this was just to ignore it
6784446 certainly theres a lot of progress left to make because he really hasnt done much full speed obviously in the last six weeks
6784447 were just going to determine it based on how he feels after the week of preparation and well see how he does in warmups it will literally be a game time decision
6784448 ooooooh completely doable so lets get a move on and square it away

6784451 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6784452 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6784453 enable d obama to buy his house at 300 000 below the asking price
6784454 he maintains his crimes were victimless and blames widespread systemic media reports for the publics and the temporary release committees alleged misconception with regard to the nature of his crimes
6784455 public order did not seem to be in unusual danger that morning certainly nothing that called for rounding up 52 people or spending millions of dollars
6784456 records show that both candidates have received contributions from the people who most often contribute in judicial races lawyers
6784457 it is absolutely improper for a trained lawyer to file a bogus federal lawsuit in an effort to vent about his personal dissatisfaction with government
6784458 furthermore if a client wishes to file a bogus lawsuit it is the responsibility of a trained professional to dissuade her from doing so
6784459 the scurrilous allegations concerning sex abuse the identification of specific priests as sexual predators and other sundry allegations have absolutely nothing to do with the lawsuit
6784460 with the work and progress we have made in the past two years we believe zi is emerging as the market leader in usability and discovery technologies we believe our product offerings are winning in the market place and we are gaining traction and momentum with leading oems and carriers that are global in scope and scale we believe there is significant value in zis product suite that is not reflected in its current share price this is a cornerstone transaction that would materially and beneficially impact the company the equity investment would bolster zis working capital and the multi million dollar contracts would ensure a healthy revenue flow todays announcement is one of many indications of the value of zi and the superior alternatives available to the company when compared to the nuance proposal

6784479 if one of them bats into the 40th over and beyond the side is going to get a large score
6784480 that is the kind of attitude that top order players should carry into a match a team then has one player who they can bat around and it gives the late middle order a chance to attack it is a foundation on which to build a huge score
6784481 none of them really came to terms with how the pitch was playing

6784484 the full results of the test burn need to be publicized and made available to the public for a review before the ministry of environment moves ahead with any decision for approval
6784485 head coach foeke booy allows me to do the training often he just observes while i do the work i keep track of progress and discuss the program with him when aandewiel was coach the board asked me to become assistant but i refused i didnt click with aandewiel and that was my main reason to say no but with booy it works out just fine
6784486 i played in the first team of osv oud beijerland when i was 15 years old i was a fast right winger i played on all positions in the team and even played one game as goalie
6784487 thats a funny story my cousin adriaan van tiggelen also played in the first team he was a big boy a center striker slow and not too skilled technically when scouts came to our games theyd ask which player was a van tiggelen and depending on who they asked theyd either point at me or my cousin thats why sparta and other clubs had lots of puzzling and conflicting scouting reports on me some would say i was slow and the next week a report came in saying i was very fast sparta decided to ignore those reports it took years before they realized what the situation was
6784488 meutstege was the preferred left back but he suddenly left the club i played one friendly and everyone was happy so i had my spot i scored in my first competition game and that was it i never lost my spot
6784489 i was really honoured by that and my heart wanted to go but anderlecht also contacted me and their offer was substantially better than ajax arie haan was coach at anderlecht and they were doing better than ajax in those days ive played 5 years for anderlecht and won many prizes there i loved it there although anderlecht wasnt a warm club they celebrated their 100 year existence recently and i expected to get an invite but i didnt hear a thing
6784490 i never actually realized how big that event was for holland until that celebration tour in amsterdam i dont think i played a remarkable tournament i did what i had to do and thats it
6784491 if we become the world champs and the knvb honchos show up at the party i will personally kick them out of the venue
6784492 i respected beenhakker he backed me in that discussion man what a bunch of clowns these officials but the wc was a disaster there was no unity whatsoever beenhakker later claimed that 75 of what happened never came out well ill tell you there was no 75 thats all leos bullshit the 75 that went wrong is probably leo himself
6784493 i played with some top players there scifo munaron degryse grun and later luc nilis our chairman was like the pope you werent supposed to talk to him when i got an offer from france i approached him constant vandenstock with it he listened to me and was very nice but at anderlecht players didnt talk to the chairman the next day the assistant coach told me that i was never ever supposed to do that anymore my transfer to france was not on hahahahaaa
6784494 i was to be the replacement for stan valckx who was very popular in eindhoven but the fans quickly turned around when they saw i could still cut it bobby robson was our coach a lovely guy he would sometimes snooze off during team talks but we didnt care he was a very nice bloke
6784495 i was 35 years old im not the come back kid it was enough
6784496 he is not straight when i was injured he pleaded me to work hard to come back and when i was fit he never used me he will tell you what you want to know but hes never honest
6784497 i knew it was a step back but this was something i hadnt expected the training complex the pitch the coach even they couldnt care less there i played my last game away against volendam not quite a grand farewell on the same day frank rijkaard retired from ajax in a different fashioin
6784498 of course i wasnt the best player but i had my added value i played in the top of europe in oranje i won an ec what more can you ecpect and nowadays my type of player is rare boulahrouz is the only one iin the dutch squad that i can see most defenders want to solve problems in a football way i always wanted to play as simple as possible you dont see that anymore
6784499 not really im happy i dont have the ambition to become head coach i live my life on saturdays i have a beer at the club in oud beijerland and watch my sons play in the first team of strijen with the wife no im good
6784500 i nail my colours to the mast and i expect and accept it is not going to be accepted by the liverpool fans
6784501 it was a new one for me to hear people saying that i had celebrated too vigorously
6784502 the stick is part of the game one week you take it on the chin the next you give it out that is how local rivals have always been and always should be
6784503 self proclaimed biggest club in world incidentally you are not amp never will be that title lies firmly at real madrid
6784504 22 of fans say their current main rival is not the same as their traditional rival which has changed due to their traditional rival no longer being in the same league or they are no longer completing for the similar goals in the same league
6784505 john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while that must have been an advantage
6784506 the difference here is that i operate my captains on seniority in the long term rio will be captain of manchester united there is no question about that it is a position we are very comfortable with that his leadership qualities have improved tremendously over the last couple of years and his ability is there for all to see
6784507 i dont think anyone was actually nailed on for it
6784508 mikael silvestre came to see me at the end of the season and said he wanted first team football i agreed with him
6784509 he was conducting his own affairs we knew the price we wanted and notified the clubs who were showing interest mainly it was sunderland he went there last friday to discuss a move and he came back and was very positive about that then man city came on the scene he was having a medical there and halfway through it he got a phone call to go to london and he ended up at arsenal we have no complaints we wish him well you could have been selfish and say you are going to be a reserve but we are bigger than that we recognised the service and let him get on with a career playing first team football
6784510 it was a big surprise but a very good surprise in the end
6784511 i left united especially because i didnt want to spend anymore time on the bench

6784869 a best deals winner may be obsolete in 2010 due to the collapsing market
6784870 despite the recent dip in gas prices significant auto rebates still exist on many larger vehicles the nissan armada beat the toyota land cruiser on the strength of a 5 000 rebate and the nissan quests 3 500 rebate makes it top in the minivan class
6784871 an interesting fact is nissan has quietly mentioned that the armada may not continue production after early 2010 that is an indication of the new reality of this market and its impact on small cars
6784872 lots of families are looking to make the switch to small cars and its noteworthy that the toyota corolla and toyota yaris two of the top smallest cars in our ranking and highly respected both carry rebates that demonstrates once again how important it is for buyers to do their homework you never know where the deals might be especially in this buyers market
6784873 the chevy silverado has been a solid presence on the best deals lists for months
6784874 however we expect to see the close outs of the 2008 dodge ram and 2008 ford f150 impact these classes as their all new 2009 models roll into the market later this year

6784903 president medvedev at one point just a few weeks ago laid out a very hopeful vision for russias interaction with the rest of the world one in which russia would be respected and accepted for its commerce and its technology and its scientific prowess and its culture and to instead have activities that hearken back to another time when all that the soviet union had was its military power its really a sad state of affairs for russia
6784904 of course the conflict in georgia is primarily rooted in borders and ethnicity wounded russian pride and global power politics but the challenges of dealing with russias two headed rule have certainly added an odd new element to the crisis

6784975 i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
6784976 as im sure youll understand we needed time to wait for results and tell our families
6784977 i looked at it and thought this seems excessive even allowing for the extra charges
6784978 when i rang the first thing they said to me was that i would be charged 79 for someone to come and read the meter
6784979 i always make sure my bills are paid i go without things sometimes but i always pay
6784980 i cant believe that im the only person who has had their meter incorrectly read what im concerned about is that there are people out there who cant afford this
6784981 this was due to an error in auroras computer billing system which is now being thoroughly investigated
6784982 aurora meter readers examine more than one million meters a year across tasmania and while human error occasionally occurs in the last 12 months the figures highlight that just 0 34 per cent of meter readings have been inaccurate

6784984 mark moved off the large rock and down onto a smaller rock approximately 1 5m below the larger rocks ledge
6784985 he spent about five seconds in the area and freed his line he then began to move back up onto the larger rock but a large wave crashed onto the rocks and swept him into the sea
6784986 i saw him holding onto some kelp near the rocks the zip up jacket he was wearing filled up with air and appeared to be assisting him to float
6784987 i saw mark floating face down in the water approximately 40m south of where we had been standing
6784988 i ran towards the beach south of the rocks because i thought he would wash ashore in that area but i lost sight of him
6784989 but its been especially difficult because he has never been found
6784990 in terms of the final result here i think that there is uncertainty
6784991 the last module has been submitted we are actively working with the federal environment department on the review and approval process
6784992 and i have been advised by both the independent experts group and my department that that is insufficient time for these processes to be completed
6784993 we have only had four modules that have come forward and given the time that these modules have taken to be delivered to the department satisfactorily then it is unlikely that gunns is going to meet the october 4 deadline
6784994 the thing about this process is that modules come through to the department but they also have to be assessed by the independent experts group as well
6784995 they have to look at the quality of information or measures proposed once they have reviewed the modules and they are satisfied then it comes to me
6784996 so where there is additional information that is required and that has been the case with a number of modules it first goes back to gunns they have to come back with additional information that satisfies the department and then it goes to the independent experts group itself
6784997 if gunns wants an extension then let them ask for it and if they do ask then mr garrett should just say no
6784998 there certainly have been delays and its not good for our industry

6785014 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms

6785031 in that statement she was requesting that he come out and give himself up
6785032 oh were too classy for cheerleaders blah blah blah we have a long standing no cheerleader tradition blah blah blah we won a super bowl blah blah blah
6785033 whenever you beat an undefeated team coached by bill belichick and quarterbacked by tom brady to win a super bowl the barometer a splodes
6785034 any reservations will surely disappear within minutes somers town is a work of integrity a touching piece of dream cinema
6785035 its not the films origins as a commercial that grate indeed aside from shots of the st pancras spire and some on train filming eurostar doesnt appear much what scuppers it is a lack of drama
6785036 some may sniff at shane meadows decision to take the eurostar shilling but so what meadows appears to have accepted their help in the same cheerful spirit that novelist fay weldon took sponsorship from the jeweller bulgari
6785037 theres plenty of pro eurostar stuff here and meadows obviously doesnt feel any great need to put balancing material in the screenplay about the advantages of an easyjet flight to charles de gaulle the plugs are noticeable but they never get in the way
6785038 it runs at only 71 minutes and was funded by eurostar but its only the ad worthy ending that will leave you feeling short changed
6785039 if nothing else we might learn from the suit where exactly the phones problems lie and that might be worth the ride even if it takes a long time to get there
6785040 a eu fiz essas baga as loucas pro cliente que ficou do caralho t ligado
6785041 i adore the samples ive tasted so many dry and tasteless cakes and goodies this week i swear i was spitting out sand afterward but this
6785042 and you dont have any exclusive agreements to supply cakes anywhere else
6785043 the truffles are distributed all over hampton roads and the internet
6785044 definitely well want to carry your truffles in the cafe
6785045 but an exclusive agreement to sell your wedding cakes through us would be wonderful wed make it worth your while were getting so many queries now and nobody wants to go all the way to the beach for a cake other cakes you make you could sell here and elsewhere
6785046 i should be able to handle what comes through the store
6785047 i have to tell you the timing couldnt be more perfect
6785048 its not a huge affair about seventy five people at best all local we dont have anything after that until june so theres time to recover
6785049 i trust the bridge and groom have a design and flavor in mind
6785050 the bridge and groom would be happy with a sheet cake from winn dixie and a punch bowl full of sprite and sherbet
6785051 they left everything to me to their credit theyd be ordering pizzas for the reception otherwise here you go
6785052 not a bad idea delivery in thirty minutes or your weddings free
6785053 jake has the contracts in the office if you can wait a few minutes well print one out for you there he is
6785054 and since were all going to be working together id like you both to meet tish richmond she made these incredible truffles you have to try them

6785058 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
6785059 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
6785060 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
6785061 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
6785062 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
6785063 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
6785064 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
6785065 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
6785066 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
6785067 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
6785068 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
6785069 we hope our new portal will help to aid and address differing agency motivations for crafting sustainability which can include saving money especially energy costs achieving legal compliance and motivating employees

6785074 come on wall street dont be slow why man this war is a go go theres plenty good money to be made by supplying the army with the tools of its trade
6785075 be it checks written to the university or the ministry
6785076 funnel exceedingly large sums of money through the university each month that was not used for any legitimate university purpose
6785077 due to the absence of any facts regarding the alleged transaction and the gag order entered in pending litigation oru is unable to comment further
6785078 to raise money for a purpose and then not use the money for that purpose many times this is where ministries have gotten in most trouble in the past years with the irs
6785079 its just another example of how ministries need real oversight
6785080 money earmarked for specific university departments went into an unmarked fund
6785081 i was told this is the way things work if you dont like the way it works maybe this isnt the place for you
6785082 if all of this money is coming in i thought theres got to be some money to help keep me here
6785083 a number of measures in place to safeguard the finances of the university
6785084 i think its disgusting to hear that money that honest people sent to help needy students went into other peoples pockets
6785085 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it

6785172 if you give the ball back too easily that always hurts especially with a side like the bulldogs they are quick and skilful and they use the ball to their team mates advantage and its through the goal before you even know about it
6785173 our work rate when we had the ball could have been a fraction better coming out of our back half we were a bit stagnant but when we did move the ball quick and sharp and hit our handballs at top end speed we used the ball well

6785177 he turned the ball over a fraction but worked tirelessly all day
6785178 he got his hands on it a lot and then used it you have to take your hat off to him after being out of the game for so long and coming back and doing what he did tonight

6785184 weve also added an incredibly talented freshman class the internal competition for spots and playing time will be tougher which will be both a blessing and a challenge for the coaches
6785185 second we need to find at least one big time goal scoring threat who can win games for us we need someone who can score goals out of nothing its always nice to have a consistent game winner
6785186 will has tremendous self confidence and seems to rise to the challenge
6785187 hes courageous and is maturing into a very confident goalkeeper hes a good shot stopper and reads the game well
6785188 hes very sharp and has great distribution skills hes mature beyond his years
6785189 the back line should be a strength we have three experienced starters
6785190 one question in the preseason will be who plays left back or do we move delagarza there could compete for starting time at either center back or left back
6785191 we could play with three four or five midfielders we might look at some alternatives
6785192 graham started the season well and finished the season well last year

6785302 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances and the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment which is not happening as we speak he signed together with the president of georgia and which was brokered by the european union presidency france
6785303 it seems like nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime it is trying to save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
6785304 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms the strategic cooperation relationship and friendship between poland and the united states

6785311 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
6785312 i see that the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed and i am sure we can get on with solving all the issues of our country the pakistan peoples party is wants to have an independent judiciary and is firm behind that stance and im sure well move forward with that issue as well
6785313 musharrafs quitting was in the air for a long time he has met the fate of all dictators he ruled pakistan for over eight years and i can say that he has not been particularly friendly towards india during this period many of the problems in our bilateral relationship were entirely because of him so his quitting should generally be regarded a good news for india and south asia

6785335 one this is the best military weve ever had and its just not big enough two there has never been a draft that i have ever heard of since world war ii that was fair what weve done is we find rich people find a way out and lower income people are the ones that serve so the thing if you could design i might consider it i dont think its necessary i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve

6785344 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6785345 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6785346 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6785347 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in
6785348 if there is not at least one joke a page then you have got a problem
6785349 you look at some of the shows and there is not a joke among them sorry but its supposed to be a comedy follow the funny you have got to be funny
6785350 observational postmodern and clever does not interest me i think there should be jokes
6785351 had no jokes in it at all it didnt even try it was all observation
6785352 like a half hour road movie where are the jokes
6785353 some people might think it was not very good its a subjective judgment
6785354 i think there were some very good jokes in it its very important we carry on trying
6785355 you can get big headlines back home for slating the repressive regime and there are some aspects that that are profoundly repressive but there is a great risk of going too far

6785357 i hope the closing ceremony does not mark the end of the games and the reblocking of websites

6785360 london will be different the london games will be the joyous games there will be a great sense of partying of festivity
6785361 the streets of london will be alive during the games

6785366 everybody remembers a good cone in their past i think
6785367 we also use local and organic ingredients as our primary ingredients for everything the toppings and the ice creams thats a really big priority for us
6785368 i learned to make ice cream in college it was my college job making ice cream at a shop called the big dipper in missoula montana where i went to school
6785369 when i was a kid my grandpa would take me for ice cream like every day in the summer and get a cone of strawberry and then my mom when i was in high school and college would always make this salad that had strawberries and balsamic vinegar and it was so delicious
6785370 and i wanted to do a new take on strawberry ice cream that could be somewhat of a signature flavor for the shop so i made this balsamic reduction and put a swirl of it through strawberry ice cream and it was a hit
6785371 salted caramel which makes a delicious savory and sweet combination we have a cardamom ice cream which is something i made a lot in montana and sold really well there scout mint i was a girl scout forever and love thin mints and so our peppermint ice cream with thin mint cookies in it is one of our biggest sellers

6785389 the last time the nations governments took its swimming prowess for granted australia failed to win a single gold medal at the 1976 montreal olympics
6785390 it took us 10 years the creation of the australian institute of sport and the influence of super coach laurie lawrence to recover from that
6785391 what weve seen at the olympics is that medals do mean a lot to the nations pride
6785392 you just have to look at great britain to see what a huge difference money makes
6785393 i have not yet made a decision to confirm the future funding levels for state level organisations under the sport and recreation development program
6785394 we will continue to support swimming through a raft of funding programs and initiatives to ensure that we provide for queenslanders who want to participate in swimming at any level competitive elite or social
6785395 they then made the decision that they would cut funding for those sports by 30 000 for the next three years to 250 000 and then in another 21 2 years it will be cut to 200 000
6785396 in real terms using inflation at the original funding level of 280 000 thats a loss of 150 000 over six years
6785397 but without us producing the goods australia becomes a third world country in terms of its swimming standing
6785398 was waren ihre erste eindr cke des valencia stra enkurses
6785399 ich denke die stadt valencia sollte auf diese strecke extrem stolz sein stra enkurse sind besonders herausfordernd und es war ohne zweifel eine beeindruckend komplexe summe an logistischer koordination von n ten um dieses rennen auf die beine zu stellen
6785400 jede neue strecke bringt erfahrungsgem einige kinderkrankheiten mit sich aber diese strecke hat das potenzial ein h hepunkt im formel 1 kalender zu werden die organisatoren haben es geschafft in einer fantastischen umgebung eine exzellente strecke und einen tollen paddock bereich zu konstruieren wir sind froh hier unseren 200 grand prix feiern zu d rfen
6785401 wie war die erste session heute morgen glauben sie dass die strecke sie als reifenlieferant vor besondere schwierigkeiten stellen wird
6785402 es war sehr spannend zu sehen wie die formel 1 wagen heute morgen das erste mal berhaupt auf der piste unterwegs waren
6785403 nat rlich haben bridgestone und die teams alles getan um sich angemessen vorzubereiten und haben einige simulationen durchgef hrt aber all das ist nichts solange man sicht selbst auf der strecke ist erst dann beginnt man sie wirklich zu verstehen
6785404 wir von bridgestone haben nicht weniger drei mal vor diesem wochenende eine technikabteilung nach valencia entsandt insofern hatten wir eine gute vorstellung von dem was wir von der strecke so zu erwarten haben in bezug auf layout oberfl che charakteristiken und wie sich all das auf die reifen auswirken k nnte
6785405 sicherheit ist immer eine hauptsorge von bridgestone und es ist eine standardprozedur von uns im vorfeld eine strecke zu untersuchen aber wir sind vergn gt dass die fahrer es alle heute morgen geschafft haben viel zeit auf der strecke zu verbringen ohne dass gr ere probleme an den reifen auftraten es sieht so aus als ob uns ein spannendes rennen am sonntag erwartet
6785406 es ist unglaublich zu denken dass es schon zw lf jahre her ist seit wir erstmals in der formel 1 aufgetreten waren
6785407 wie f hlt es sich an dass bridgestone nach seinem deb t 1997 die 200 rennen marke geknackt hat
6785408 es ist unglaublich zu denken dass es schon zw lf jahre her ist seit wir erstmals in der formel 1 aufgetreten waren die zeit ist so schnell vergangen aber wir sich sehr stolz in valencia unser 200 rennen feiern zu k nnen
6785409 es ist f r alle beteiligten ein gro es lob besonders f r unsere reifen technikabteilung dass wir so erfolgreich und so professionell in diesem sport auftreten zus tzlich sind wir ber die unterst tzung sehr froh welche uns die teams innerhalb dieser periode haben zukommen lassen
6785410 wie sah das ziel aus als bridgestone zum ersten mal in der formel 1 auftrat
6785411 die formel 1 ist nicht nur die spitze aller monopost serien aber auch einer der am meisten verfolgten sportarten auf der ganzen welt insofern machte es durchaus einen sinn daran beteiligt zu sein
6785412 in der zeit war die bekanntheit unserer marke und ihr marktanteil nur auf bestimmten m rkten sehr hoch wie zum beispiel europa auf anderen m rkten wie zum beispiel europa war es leider nicht so die formel 1 zu betreten hat wahnsinnig dazu beigetragen die bekanntheit unserer marke zu steigern jetzt sind wir auf dem ganzen globus bekannt
6785413 die bekanntheit unserer marke hat sich auf vielen schl sselm rkten auf der ganzen welt stark vergr ert
6785414 wie sehr hat bridgestone von seiner zeit in der formel 1 profitiert
6785415 seit unserem antritt in der formel 1 und unseren erfolgreichen duellen gegen konkurrierende reifenhersteller hat sich die bekanntheit unserer marke auf vielen schl sselm rkten auf der ganzen welt stark vergr ert
6785416 dar ber hinaus haben viele kunden die technischen f higkeiten und qualit ten unserer produkte gesehen und kennen gelernt zus tzlich haben wir eine sehr f hige technikabteilung rekrutiert und starke partnerschaften mit vielen weltmarktf hrenden automobilherstellern geschlossen
6785417 inwiefern unterscheidet sich die formel 1 von anderen motorsport kategorien wo bridgestone bisher angetreten ist
6785418 die formel 1 ist sehr professionell und das wird durch die riesigen einschaltquoten reflektiert welche sie erzielt dadurch dass so viele leute im fernsehen zuschauen ist unser erfolgsdruck enorm
6785419 bridgestone hat sich w hrend seiner zeit in der formel 1 mit zwei gegnerischen reifenherstellern gemessen wie schwierig waren diese zwei wettk mpfe
6785420 ja wir haben w hrend unserer zeit in der formel 1 gegen zwei andere hersteller gek mpft goodyear und michelin anm d red und jede dieser beiden perioden hat uns einige sehr spannende rennen beschert
6785421 jeder reifenhersteller hat seine eigenen ideen und philosophien das haben wir respektiert und haben die z hen k mpfe mit ihnen sehr genossen das waren sehr gute zeiten f r uns jetzt ist die situation ein wenig anderes aber nichtsdestotrotz haben wir viel spa dabei mit allen teams zu arbeiten
6785422 1999 war ein schwieriges jahr weil wir uns pl tzlich unerwartet in der rolle des alleinausstatters wiedergefunden haben
6785423 es war nicht einfach und wir haben extrem hart gearbeitet es muss aber auch erw hnt werden dass es ein sehr spezieller moment war bei unserem ersten rennen in australien 1997 unsere reifen zum ersten mal an formel 1 autos zu sehen
6785424 die erste meisterschaft 1998 mit mclaren mercedes und mika h kkinen war auch ein gro es highlight 1999 war ein schwieriges jahr weil wir uns pl tzlich unerwartet in der rolle des alleinausstatters wiedergefunden haben wir hatten noch nicht genug erfahrungen aber wir sind als resultat aus dieser zeit immer st rker gewachsen
6785425 es war auch der beginn einer sehr erfolgreichen partnerschaft mit der scuderia ferrari und michael schumacher viele meisterschaften haben wir gemeinsam auf unseren reifen eingefahren hinter uns liegt eine lange reise jetzt wo wir unser 200 rennen begehen unsere firma hatte schon immer eine gro e leidenschaft und ein riesiges bestreben nach exzellenz und jetzt freuen wir uns auf die weiteren 100 grand prix

6785429 the launching of a new differently abled toy drive campaign by tlc mobility foundation it is designed to acquire and distribute toys for special needs children to in need organizations and individuals
6785430 the campaign looks to go beyond the disability stigma and focus on the ability of these children by bringing as an example she said a toy for a child who is blind should be something that has a sensory feel to it and obviously nothing sharp
6785431 physical challenges may range from specific medical conditions or illnesses to developmental delays or a mental disorder the physical challenge may be visible or invisible known or unknown it may be apparent at birth or emerge as the child grows older it may come later as a result of an injury or illness
6785432 are the same for those for children without physical challenges however we feel there is a gap that should be filled
6785433 we have teamed up with a leading toy rating organization to identify suitable toys based on four general disability categories physical sensory communicative and cognitive
6785434 the public can contribute by purchasing a toy or two online at all proceeds she said will be used to support the differently abled toy drive the goal of 2008 is to provide holiday gifts to at least 5 000 children

6785467 its a living highway for those who live and those who have died everyone who has served with the 173rd airborne brigade this is for the guys and gals yesterday today and tomorrow
6785468 it was neat that our state legislators in a time when theres been a little bit of divisiveness were able to work together and pass this joint resolution unanimously
6785469 when bob getz brought this to me and told me the history of the 173rd airborne brigade i thought this was a great way to honor those who had served on our behalf and i was happy to support the initiative
6785470 i think we owe them a great debt of gratitude and this is a small honor we can give them
6785471 i dont know how many members of the 173rd airborne brigade will be in the area but we said if you are anywhere between chicago and rockford madison and milwaukee come and join us
6785472 grave digger look forward to working together with their new label napalm records we have observed the excellent work of the label in the past few years
6785473 un climate change talks accra 2008 constitute the third major unfccc
6785474 there is a real need for strengthening the capacity of countries particularly in africa in coping with such climate shocks
6785475 i would therefore like to call for an international deal or
6785476 we need to be pragmatic and move beyond rhetoric to make progress as we move towards copenhagen
6785477 if you want me to estimate how much time id say a couple of weeks before you see a major pullout
6785478 godhate has spent the last year recruiting new members and writing a whole new album
6785479 you know this has a really rare drop rate right
6785480 you know this is the best chestpiece in the game for you right
6785481 you better go make this tonight or we kill you
6785482 yeah i mean we kind of knew back in even last august when alice in chains came out and was opening for us on that tour thats when we first started to really know this isnt going to work out with scott
6785483 by itself the war in georgia isnt that big a deal economically
6785484 but it does mark the end of the pax americana the era in which the united states more or less maintained a monopoly on the use of military force and that raises some real questions about the future of globalization
6785485 nein ich habe alles verlernt und mein deutsch wird auch immer schlechter weil ich unter bayern lebe
6785486 ich schon aber du hast keine ahnung vom ugali wie konntest du blo schreiben dass ugali nach nichts schmeckt
6785487 the poor man we say hes so devoted to his flock the work is endless and he sacrifices himself so unstintingly but the word
6785488 no one level of government told us which way to go
6785489 and by the time wed hung six signs wed aquired a nine year old girl an eight year old boy and his five year old sister
6785490 just run this shell script to verify youre not infected
6785491 i hate watching people apologize after a bad performance but i now know why they do it
6785492 i do this every day i do this well every day
6785493 im not bragging im not boasting every time i race every time i line up i am a contender and today i simply was not even close
6785494 the feeling of getting passed by six guys i never lose to was devastating i wanted to disappear
6785495 im sure hes livid hes probably the most competitive person i know
6785496 i dont think he has to apologize to canada its a sport and adam would be the first to tell you that you win and you lose thats what we love about this sport thats why we do it
6785497 i was watching guys i never lose to go by me
6785498 the first thing that went through my head is what have i done
6785499 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6785500 they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
6785501 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
6785502 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
6785503 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
6785504 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6785505 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6785506 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6785507 the popularity of baking and pastry has never been greater
6785508 despite great expectations and promising results of clinical trials we still lack sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer
6785509 with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious
6785510 i believe the vaccine is a great advance but we have to implement it properly to get the benefits and that hasnt happened
6785511 when the time comes im going to nip it and tuck it all
6785512 were really being proactive with this initiative to strengthen the business and improve its profitability and competitiveness
6785513 we will witness dismantling of the corrupt regime in a very near future
6785514 en el cauca los combates entre dos grupos guerrilleros y el ej rcito han forzado a 800 personas a abandonar la localidad de l pez de micay y las condiciones de estas personas son muy precarias
6785515 unas 1 000 personas dejaron sus hogares en la parte andina cercana a la ciudad de policarpa igualmente a causa de los enfrentamientos armados
6785516 a m s tardar ma ana ser dada de alta
6785517 we cannot confirm that the infection was the result of eating the recalled meat
6785518 we cant demonstrate a clear link but many strains of listeria exist and it was the exact same one
6785519 right now we only have one death that is confirmed to meet the criteria and in the physicians perspective was the underlying cause of death i am expecting more listeriosis cases to be reported
6785520 were going to try to identify the strain that is making people sick
6785521 how exactly long that will take is very hard to tell right now
6785522 fernseh reporterin katie courie ihres zeichens erste chefin einer prime time nachrichtensendung auf cbs konstatiert angesichts der causa clinton unumwunden dass
6785523 obamas durchbruch sagt etwas wunderbares ber den stand unserer rassenpolitik aus aber sein schweigen angesichts des zynischen medialen lynchmords von hillary clinton durch eine pressemeute die besessen von ihrem geschlecht ist spricht ebenfalls b nde
6785524 i love this one two three four five counting the menz to one
6785525 i dont think she meant that the way it sounded
6785526 ill throw you under a bus to make my own star shine brighter bitch

6785529 i was shocked when i found out mccain lied about obamas tax cuts
6785530 i found out that obama actually gives us a bigger tax cut of 1 000 than mccain does he thinks his idea of a tax cut for a family of four is 319 talk about being out of touch and i guess thats what happens when you cant even remember how many houses you own
6785531 its time for mccain to come clean about the lies hes spreading about obamas tax cut plan
6785532 im just frankly disgusted with john mccain is this the kind of politics hes going to run in the white house talk about being another bush third term
6785533 while the british public are having to tighten their belts the government is spending taxpayers money on a completely frivolous project
6785534 apple has received very few reports of such incidents less than 0 001 per cent of first generation ipod nano units which have been traced back to a single battery supplier
6785535 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
6785536 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt
6785537 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
6785538 either these machines were downgraded by hardware companies like dell or hp or they were downgraded by the user after they got the machine in any case these machines are no longer running vista
6785539 in my travels round the world i have always been surprised that no matter where i go people recognise and know me from europe australia and india to the philippines and the zulu nation in south africa
6785540 this got me thinking i realised that while two people from two entirely different countries and backgrounds may seem to have nothing in common the only thing they might have in common is me
6785541 so i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me where it will lead i dont know but the world would be a better place if everyone talked a little more to each other

6785585 the importance and challenge of paying for quality nursing care
6785586 historically the economic value that nursing brings to the patient care process has not been recognized or quantified

6785655 il mondo dei santi ha i colori dei nostri giorni e di dio
6785656 nella lettera che ha accompagnato il dono ha affermato monsignor pasotto raggiunto al telefono a tblisi da zenit il santo padre ha spiegato che il contributo deve servire a far s che quelle dellangelus non siano solo parole
6785657 affinch siano alleviati con generosit i gravi disagi dei profughi soprattutto delle donne e dei bambini che mancano perfino del necessario per sopravvivere
6785658 in un paese a maggioranza di religione ortodossa ha spiegato monsignor pasotto ha fatto scalpore che il capo della chiesa cattolica si interessasse in maniera cos decisa del conflitto in corso e che avesse cuore la popolazione georgiana pregando per essa
6785659 ha gettato nel panico la popolazione anche nelle zone non colpite come la capitale facendo riaffiorare improvvisamente i ricordi laceranti del conflitto di 18 anni fa con labkhazia
6785660 e stato molto bello vedere come le famiglie della capitale si siano date da fare per portare quello che potevano ai profughi arrivati allimprovviso e che non avrebbero avuto nemmeno un materasso per stendersi
6785661 i profughi ha raccontato ancora monsignor pasotto circa 80 90 mila disseminati in 200 punti di accoglienza in citt per i primi giorni sono rimasti completamente in silenzio non trovavano pi le parole ieri i giovani della parrocchia si sono recati in un centro per fare animazione con i bambini e hanno constatato che le donne stanno reagendo ma gli uomini sono ancora in silenzio
6785662 c ancora tensione non si capisce perch nonostante quanto stabilito sia ancora tutto bloccato e non si possa andare dove si vuole
6785663 sia il governo georgiano che il patriarcato ha spiegato il presule hanno chiesto aiuto alla chiesa cattolica e ci stiamo dando molto da fare con un grande spirito di collaborazione
6785664 sono stati dei momenti di incontro molto belli ha affermato monsignor pasotto importante in situazioni come questa sentirsi tutti uniti al di l delle differenze di fede
6785665 adesso afferma monsignor pasotto gli aiuti internazionali non mancano ma la situazione di precariet minaccia di durare a lungo gi si dice che le scuole non apriranno perch sono tutte occupate dai profughi
6785666 forse alcuni di questi potranno tornare a gori ma non a tskhinvali occorrer ricostruire le case e vigilare affinch tutti ricevano aiuti e nessuno che ha bisogno sia dimenticato tra sette o otto mesi ci si ricorder ancora della georgia
6785667 occorre che i media ha concluso non si limitino a cercare il sensazionalismo ma operino per il bene per aiutare chi sta soffrendo e diano uninformazione il pi possibile corretta
6785668 current state of the art research facilities require heavy hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning to ensure the proper air changes in the laboratory and laboratory support spaces

6785696 the faithful do resist the bogus certainties of religion when they come from any religion but their own every christian knows what it is like to find the claims of muslims to be deeply suspect everyone who is not a mormon knows at a glance that mormonism is an obscenely stupid system of beliefs everyone has rejected an infinite number of spurious claims about god the atheist simply rejects one more

6785728 i played solid im hitting the ball pretty good and keeping it in play and making a few putts its a pretty good combination
6785729 on 17 i lost my focus and its a lesson for me ill just be more patient im over it

6785731 a lot of times i would make a good start but had a hard time closing it i dont think i was in the right physical shape then and tired out in the weekend thats one thing ive been working on as you know in asia it gets pretty warm
6785732 my swing was a bit loose as well but at the long beach i finished well and won it i feel my swing is getting better from the work that ive put and ive gained more confidence
6785733 id prefer to be leading but got a little sloppy from nine to 12 i realized i didnt eat enough food out there and made a few mistakes around the turn i started eating after that and then made some birdies coming home
6785734 you just get a good feeling here there are certain holes where you know youre going to hit it close its been a while since his last win and its been a frustrating last couple of years
6785735 i played a lot better than yesterday it was nearly perfect but i just couldnt hole the putts
6785736 its nice to be in contention but itll be important for me to stick to my routine and not think of it too much
6785737 its a change compared to whats been going on the last few months its been pretty tough ive been working on my swing after a friend asked me to play with a fade and last two days i played with a fade and hit 18 greens today

6785751 as the baby boom generation of corporate leaders and experts approaches retirement businesses in the u s canada and many european nations face the loss of experience and knowledge on an unprecedented scale
6785752 younger workers cant be counted on to fill the void as they lack the experience that builds deep expertise they also tend to change jobs frequently taking their technological savvy and any knowledge theyve gained with them
6785753 while the process may seem long and complex it can sometimes be accomplished quickly in practice
6785754 but several iterations through the process may be necessary when the knowledge is deep complex or large in scope
6785755 knowledge transfer is not as widely practiced as the potential business benefits and workforce demographics suggest it should be
6785756 in a knowledge economy firm specific knowledge is critical to the sustainability performance and innovation of organizations facing the imminent retirement of large numbers of baby boomers
6785757 is the sky falling because boomer knowledge and business wisdom are leaving organizations at an unprecedented rate probably not but there is significant opportunity in strategic and targeted knowledge transfer

6785773 i may have the body of a weak and feeble woman but i have the heart and stomach of a concrete elephant
6785774 der asphalt war noch sehr schmutzig am morgen es dauerte bis die strecke einigerma en guten grip bot
6785775 die bedingungen w hrend der zweiten session waren besser obwohl es immer noch recht rutschig war
6785776 die streckenbedingungen waren jedoch nie f r eine halbe stunde konstant
6785777 obwohl wir hier auf einer neuen strecke fahren gab es keine berraschungen in bezug auf die abstimmung der autos
6785778 weil es auf diesem neuen parcours keine referenzwerte gibt werden wir nun alle daten analysieren und dabei im besonderen die sektorzeiten vergleichen um die richtigen schl sse f r die abstimmung zu ziehen
6785779 aber wir hatten sogar noch gl ck dass wir ohne einen schaden am auto davongekommen sind
6785780 danach ist die strecke gegen ende immer besser geworden deshalb ist eine einsch tzung etwas schwierig aber die strecke sollte unserem auto liegen
6785781 its disturbing that a bishop who postured so vigorously as a reformer would ignore his own hand picked panel and much touted policy
6785782 a third example of bad behavior by the church with respect to addressing clergy sexual abuse is not just deeply disappointing but disgusting
6785783 a priest named raymond kownacki in illinois was alleged to have persuaded a family to let a teenage girl go with him to a new diocese in order to attend a better school
6785784 now two other victims have come forward in one case the plaintiff requested kownackis mental health records the court ordered the church to produce them but it refused the result was that the court held the diocese in contempt
6785785 sadly this particular diocese is headed by the president of the united states conference of catholic bishops
6785786 these three examples are just anecdotes in the war on childhood sexual abuse in the united states they prove that this war is far from over

6785792 als wohl jeder andere deprimiert gewesen w re und aufgegeben h tte ist valentino mit dem vorhaben zu siegen ins rennen gegangen wenn man sich das rational durchdenkt dann war es beinahe verr ckt in laguna an den sieg zu denken aber sein kampfgeist ist beeindruckend
6785793 das war sehr wichtig denn dadurch haben valentino und das team viel selbstvertrauen gewonnen es wir eine gro e motivation f r alle es war so au ergew hnlich da wir trotz des r ckstands im training nie aufgegeben haben in br nn war das genauso

6785889 much of the increase is attributed to the significant number of people entering and re entering the labor force which could be a sign that workers believe jobs are out there and they are actively looking we were encouraged by the large number of workers 31 435 who found employment in july

6785892 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6785893 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6785894 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6785895 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6785896 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6785905 and being in a cage and watching a runway model feed was definitely one of them for me
6785906 it is one of the most basic tenets of wildlife care that you do not feed runway models because it alters their behavior
6785907 they begin to lose their natural reticence indifference maybe even aversion to humans and begin to associate them with food perhaps
6785908 unless theyre actually fed theyre not positively re enforced to come to that cage
6785909 in fact theyre in a sense what humans may call frustrated

6785944 we keep thinking its been 100 years since a world series victory but maybe thats the problem what if we think in months
6785945 we need to change the collective negative energy of 100 years to positive energy if they are going to win the world series this year and in the future
6785946 the 1200 month fan is the antidote the force to shift the energy to positive lets get rid of the foreboding of waiting for something to go wrong lets know that the 1200th month is ours lets fill the cub nation with positive energy

6786021 the judge seemed to ignore the plain evidence we provided and just accept reeds arguments even if he hadnt provided any documentation to back up his assertions
6786022 the fact of the matter is that these registrations are continuing to come in and reeds staff has shown an inability to intercept them in a timely fashion to prevent illegal voting

6786054 es una verdadera carrera de obst culos la fiv impone obligaciones de organizaci n muy pesadas tratamientos dolorosos y un alto riesgo de fracaso algunos sienten que se instrumentaliza su cuerpo las mujeres porque se convierten en una m quina de producir ovocitos y los hombres porque se ven reducidos a donantes muchos se rebelan frente a una medicina que califican de veterinaria demasiado estandarizada y an nima
6786055 despu s de cada intento de fiv m s de un 25 de las parejas abandonan y muy pocas van m s all de cuatro tentativas
6786056 hay poca informaci n sobre la tasa de xito en la t cnicas de fecundaci n in vitro las cl nicas dan porcentajes de entre el 20 y el 30 por ciento
6786057 en medicina una t cnica con un 70 por ciento de fracasos no se har a no se admitir a pero aqu todo vale como las familias buscan el hijo desesperadamente se les ofrecen novedades a adidos que puedan darles m s garant as y se encarece todo el proceso t cnico es una industria muy rentable y las posibilidades son muy amplias
6786058 aunque en esta cl nica no hacemos reproducci n asistida por motivos ticos llegan a consulta bastantes matrimonios con dramas tremendos tanto por los fracasos de la t cnica como por saber despu s del xito que tienen a n embriones congelados y deben decidir qu hacer con ellos despu s de cinco a os si no quieren o no pueden afrontar un nuevo embarazo
6786059 eso es una barbaridad porque indica que muchas los tienen ya cumplidos los 35
6786060 en bastantes centros de reproducci n asistida se ofrecen t cnicas in vitro en plazos breves seis o doce meses despu s de la primera consulta la microcirug a tub rica por ejemplo para la reconstrucci n de ligaduras anteriores tiene una tasa de xito de embarazos del 70 por ciento muy por encima de la que ofrece la fiv pero de esto se informa poco
6786061 valdr a la pena despenalizar este procedimiento aunque aplic ndolo de manera pormenorizada
6786062 el embarazo no consiste solo en llevar a un beb es una experiencia fundamental que modela a los dos protagonistas la futura madre y el hijo en gestaci n apenas estamos empezando a descubrir la complejidad y la riqueza de la interacci n entre la madre y el beb en el tero
6786063 no other federation in the world possesses so many features of likeness to that of the united states as does the commonwealth of australia and i doubt whether any two peoples can be found who are nearer in touch with each other and are likely to benefit more by anything that tends to knit their relations more closely
6786064 would form a military alliance in the pacific that some years later would be formalised by a security treaty
6786065 i have as every american ought to have a hearty admiration for and fellow feeling with australia and i believe that america should be ready to stand back of australia in any serious emergency

6786069 a couple of years ago i was able to buy everything practically new
6786070 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6786071 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6786072 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6786073 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6786074 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
6786075 thats not a good way to start the school year
6786076 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
6786077 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it

6786081 lately weve been behind ferrari and mclaren compared to where we were at the beginning of the season
6786082 so the job has become harder especially as toyota have recently been quicker than us whilst renault have also been very close
6786083 if i had the quickest car then i would say yes i am still in it because everything can all change very quickly
6786084 i hope things will improve this weekend and if not then it will be difficult
6786085 but whilst there is a chance then i will try if it doesnt work out then ill still be happy because i will have achieved my goals and targets this season
6786086 from a driver point of view you know if you can do any more or not
6786087 if you are pushing your skills and car performance to the limit you can do no more and thats the most important thing for me
6786088 it was not as if we had different ways to go
6786089 if we developed x the others went forward more additionally in the last two or three races weve had some bad luck whilst weve also made crucial mistakes
6786090 such as in hungary with the tyre pressures which unfortunately happened in all three sets so that was an operational mistake
6786091 in qualifying i was just a tenth of a second slower than massa so you cannot say our car is slower than others
6786092 alguien tiene que cuidar y controlar los servicios p blicos y que estos obedezcan a una sola pol tica y en cuanto a las erogaciones observ que la mayor a de los entes que se han fundado son ad honorem como por ejemplo el consejo de la magistratura el consejo asesor econ mico y social y el tribunal de cuentas otro de los temas de la reuni n fue la propuesta del convencional daniel zabala para crear un tribunal fiscal proyecto que resolvieron remitir a la oficina de sugerencias ciudadanas de la c mara de diputados de la provincia aconsejando su tratamiento mientras que se resolvi el archivo del proyecto sobre auditor a porque entendieron que parte de su contenido estuvo plasmado en el nuevo tribunal de cuentas

6786114 people are still tolerant but there is a growing suspicion among muslims of others
6786115 the state has some responsibility for this growing intolerance namely by not upholding the law

6786128 in response to a request from the international olympic committee the fig has now asked the chinese gymnastic association to submit further documents testifying to the birthdates of the gymnasts
6786129 on receipt of these documents the fig will forward its conclusions to the international olympic committee it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6786130 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6786131 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6786132 im not going to do anything that affects my swimming

6786135 were excited to tell atlantis stories on a bigger canvas
6786136 the successes of the two original stargate dtv movies the ark of truth and continuum have shown us the opportunities that the movie format offers we have plans for both sg 1 and atlantis to remain vital as we expand the franchise
6786137 we share in the producers enthusiasm to move forward in this direction and we look forward to a strong and continued relationship on stargate atlantis in this new format
6786138 one hundred episodes is the goal of every writer producer
6786139 to have achieved that with a spin off series is amazing and like sg 1 i dont feel as though anything is coming to an end with atlantis its just evolving ark of truth and continuum were hugely satisfying creatively for everyone involved precisely because they were movies and we have no intention of stopping there
6786140 rob and i have spent several years biting our finger nails over the prospect of renewal but youve got to respect both mgm and sci fi for giving us the opportunity to continue both atlantis and sg 1 in a series of movies
6786141 this is nothing to complain about its something to look forward to
6786142 keep in mind that stargate worlds the huge online game is just around the corner and with the prospect of another stargate television series also on the horizon the franchise is really as strong as it has ever been
6786143 were excited to tell atlantis stories on a bigger canvas the successes of the two original stargate dtv movies the ark of truth and continuum have shown us the opportunities that the movie format offers we have plans for both sg 1 and atlantis to remain vital as we expand the franchise
6786144 we share in the producers enthusiasm to move forward in this direction and we look forward to a strong and continued relationship on stargate atlantis in this new format
6786145 unable to return to earth the crew must fend for themselves aboard the ship which has a preprogrammed mission taking them to the far reaches of the universe
6786146 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
6786147 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
6786148 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home
6786149 above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
6786150 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
6786151 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
6786152 schollers i am bolde in steade of new wine to carowse to you a cuppe of newes
6786153 oh we already hired someone but we wanted to hear what you had to say because we thought he sounded knowledgeable
6786154 only laziness or intentional story burying in the media can kill this embarrassing and revealing story
6786155 barack obama has a catholic problem if he doesnt do better than john kerry did in 2004 with this quintessential swing voting bloc he wont be elected catholics are by no means a single issue voting group but for observant catholics those who attend mass regularly and follow the churchs teachings a candidates position on abortion matters
6786156 as on so many issues obama risks losing the far left of his party if he moderates his own out of the mainstream positions in order to win more centrist voters instead hell probably continue to talk out of both sides of his mouth on the issue and hope catholic voters dont notice
6786157 we went out on new tyres fairly early on and the track ramped up a lot towards the end of the session so its difficult to really tell but i think the track is suiting our car
6786158 we will have to wait and see what happens tomorrow and in the race
6786159 in terms of setup we made a considerable improvement today which is good
6786160 we lost a set of tyres with nico following his spin and were obviously lucky to get away without any car damage
6786161 in a way its good the team are talking to someone like alonso who has a lot of experience and with good teams
6786162 they are going to talk to other drivers thats only natural but im very happy with my position within the team rubens is a teammate i think he is fantastic has done a great job and he gives excellent feedback probably better than any other driver out there
6786163 so im sure whatever the teams decision is and if they are talking to him then it will be a very difficult decision for the team to make
6786164 before rubens came to the team i was asked who i thought was competitive and who would be a good teammate and i named a couple of drivers with rubens one of them
6786165 they are obviously interested in your opinion because they want the best they can get which is only natural
6786166 he has done a really good job here this year especially because he has put in some great performances i think everyone would be gutted if that was the case no one more than rubens himself
6786167 as his teammate he has been a great one to have and hopefully that will continue he is still very dedicated to improving the car and as he says and ross as well he is driving his best he is doing a good job
6786168 aunque algunos mercados han experimentado ciertas mejor as la tormenta financiera todav a no ha disminuido e influye en la ralentizaci n de la actividad econ mica y en el aumento del desempleo
6786169 its about the right cancer treatment at the right time in the right place and is ultimately about giving patients the best possible chance
6786170 ordinary guy wakes up a 100 years into the future
6786171 i love the episodes with the family being close they hasnt been so much of that in recent years
6786172 of course nowadays we counter that by not making any good ones
6786173 at least arguably suggest the petitioner lacks a rational understanding of the causal link between his role in his criminal offense and the reason he has been sentenced to death
6786174 a system which requires an insane person to first make a substantial showing of his own lack of mental capacity without the assistance of counsel or a mental health expert in order to obtain such assistance is by definition an insane system
6786175 motion presents non frivolous arguments suggesting he currently lacks a rational understanding of the connection between his role in his offense and the punishment imposed upon him
6786176 we applaud the court for upholding jeff woods rudimentary due process right to have his competency evaluated
6786177 today the federal district court granted a stay of execution in the case of jeff wood to allow the court to consider compelling evidence that jeff wood is too mentally ill to be executed
6786178 held that the texas state courts have not carefully reviewed the question of woods competence and that a stay of execution is necessary to ensure that woods mental health issues are fully presented and considered by the courts
6786179 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary
6786180 a delusional system an inability to grasp the reality surrounding the issues specific to this case his role in it in the crime
6786181 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6786182 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6786183 leaves too much scope for uncertainty for business to continue to invest in existing and new facilities
6786184 the rise of china and india is bringing the centre of gravity of world markets closer to our shores and with it a myriad of opportunities this means that three of the four biggest economies in the world now sit within our region
6786185 australia is finding itself closer to the centre of the world economy than either europe or north america will be at last our geographic position is an advantage not an obstacle
6786186 we welcome a broader debate about the economy and the opportunity to pit our coherent and consistent long term plans against the liberals short term politics
6786187 after nine months the contrast between our responsible approach and their irresponsible politicking is becoming starker by the day
6786188 our budget settings have been vindicated by current global conditions and our long term policy agenda is substantial
6786189 sometimes i wonder if there is an eagle eye or whether in fact we just have a swan that flaps its wings and squawks very loudly
6786190 the liberals have been in opposition for nine months and still not a peep of a costed economic policy alternative from mr turnbull so far all they have in mind is to irresponsibly punch a hole in the surplus deny medicare tax relief and make rtds ready to drink alcohol mixes cheaper for teenagers
6786191 he couldnt decide whether we cut too hard or not hard enough so he said wed done both
6786192 a combination of costellos 12 rate rises and turnbulls nine months of self promotion has severely damaged any economic credibility the liberals may have once had
6786193 we are pleased that cosla has approached us to reopen talks on this years pay award following the successful strike by members of the three unions on wednesday we also note that the invitation to talks addresses some of the contentious issues obviously we want a solution to this dispute so we hope that discussions around a new offer more acceptable to our members can start quickly
6786194 members made it very clear on wednesday that they want a settlement that protects them from inflation and does not lock them in to multi year awards the talks are welcome but are not in themselves a solution we will be talking to our fellow unions to agree future action should it be required and will announce this later

6786201 the u110 ultralight we received looks striking with a scarlet paisley etched aluminum lid paired with a shiny jet black keyboard area
6786202 we believe it will be significantly different than anything that has come before
6786203 i am progressive i am liberal i make no apologies
6786204 lets all get together and make a lot of noise yay free mumia
6786205 in the heat of the moment you need to differentiate between credible and effective threats and those that wont make a ripple in the media landscape

6786387 would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here
6786388 that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
6786389 lives a march hare visit either you like theyre both mad
6786390 if you want a friend in washington get a dog
6786391 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to offshore drilling
6786392 celebrities like to spend the millions barack obama is no different only it is your money he wants to spend
6786393 that is it is not blue or red but somewhere in between
6786394 the state is pretty diverse from the very liberal boulder northwest of denver to the very conservative suburbs of denver and farming communities i think that since obama has done well in the rocky mountain region he has a real chance to win colorado even though the state is presently leaning to mccain
6786395 the growth of the hispanic voting population is part of the new democratic trend there but so is in migration from places like california
6786396 people just carry their partisan leanings with them to their new home college and hi tech communities also tend to be strongly democratic and those populations have increased in colorado too so there are several demographic shifts that have played a role
6786397 while occasionally mentioned as a possible target for john kerry in 2004 colorado has shifted to become one of the half dozen or so critical swing states for this year
6786398 the state has moved mostly because the demographics of the state are changing as are the attitudes of the people still living there
6786399 conservatives have been demoralised by high government spending and rising deficits during this bush presidency
6786400 i think he is going to win the election because of colorado i think it is going to be a swing state and it is going to be important at the end of the day
6786401 being a cowboy on a cattle drive was not a career move it was a tough dirty dangerous low paying job but it was the type of job that a black man could get in the 1870s
6786402 a lot of african americans in the old west were freed slaves who migrated west after the civil war back on southern plantations they worked with horses or were blacksmiths so it was only natural that they would gravitate towards these type of jobs in the west

6786413 well i met frank sinatra and bob dylan in the space of 15 minutes frank sinatra kissed me on the lips he kissed me on the lips and then he gave me a filterless cigarette and then i met bob dylan i came off all lightheaded and had to go sit on his dressing room steps
6786414 i was doing shows and flying economy and nobody ever fed me or id be staying in hotels so cheap that by the time id get in there wasnt any room service i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
6786415 i wasnt the amazonian girl that everyone in fashion was used to with the big tits all curvy and tall i was small in comparison its funny though because i always thought i was as tall as like christy and then id be doing her makeup in the mirror and realize that i was 5 inches shorter
6786416 i think about it when youre shooting you go to references in your mind you think about how you should stand in these particular clothes or how you should move you think about the different characters youre playing really
6786417 i would say im self taught but corinne day made me less conscious of myself
6786418 oh no i dont want to be different i want to have big tits i want to look like cindy crawford
6786419 they are not committed to judicial restraint but instead view the judicial branch as a political branch
6786420 we will study mr fischers judicial philosophy background and qualifications and make a statement regarding his nomination in the coming days
6786421 above all we are concerned that the secretive and unaccountable missouri plan may be facilitating the nomination of mediocre judges highly qualified applicants with commitments to judicial restraint did not make the panel of nominees including professor
6786422 he went to the bookmakers and a bar in the centre of greenock where he spent the day drinking pints of lager and whisky
6786423 he then headed to tesco to get some shopping and parked his car in the upper level then things took a turn for the worse
6786424 it was now around 4 10pm and a cctv operator in the car park saw him coming down the ramp and going through a barrier and wedging the car between it and the pavement
6786425 police were contacted and told the accused was in fact stuck inside the car
6786426 officers approached and he rolled the window down and said to them im alright the engine light came on and the car rolled down the hill
6786427 the accused then admitted he had been drinking that day and said i shouldnt have driven
6786428 i will need to get background reports to tell me more about you because that might be what keeps you from going to jail
6786429 all my property is in joint ownership why do i need a will
6786430 sometimes the ball looks like a beach ball coming in slowly and sometimes it looks like a golf ball coming in quickly today was a beach ball day
6786431 i think craigs been talking to him about the beach ball
6786432 a goalkeeper can get hot and a goalkeeper can get cold i felt extremely hot
6786433 i talked to my teammates after that game and told them it wont happen again
6786434 i know how good of a goalkeeper i am and i know that i need to be on my game to help fire my team up on offense
6786435 theyve won a lot of gold medals and were ready to rain on their parade
6786436 its great to be here and great to be going for the gold
6786437 brick walls are there for a reason they are not there to keep us out they are there to show how badly we want something the brick walls are there to stop people who dont want it badly enough they are there for other people
6786438 wait long enough and people will surprise and impress you
6786439 i have no idea what this is going to taste like
6786440 it taste like a sausage casing filled with baby poop
6786441 our resolve as a union is not going to change unfortunately we lost a great leader you hope that there will be some very qualified people calling and asking for that position when the time is right the process will take care of itself
6786442 gene and i have been through so much together the same words can come out of each others mouth thats going to be my guide
6786443 shock disbelief i could not believe the words i was hearing
6786444 i had a chance to see him four maybe six weeks ago he looked healthy he didnt show any signs that this could be a problem
6786445 he was like a father figure having been a player and then fighting for our benefits and rights as players every time id see him it was like seeing one of the family always a very authentic moment its just a sad day for the nfl
6786446 i never saw him tired he never missed a game he had played tough and through all of the battles with the union he never blinked he never let anybody see him sweat
6786447 he was so strong willed ill bet he convinced himself that it was nothing more than a bug
6786448 right now its too early to speculate on any of that
6786449 personally all i want is for gene to be properly memorialized
6786450 i have been witness to other reps broach this subject with gene and past executive committee members
6786451 and the issue garnered zero traction toward a satisfactory answer
6786452 i honestly believe the intent of the e mail was to find a successor when the time is right
6786453 you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6786454 there was so much misinformation built up over the years it becomes the truth to some people
6786455 it caught up with him but it also speaks to his one blind spot he was too proud to beat his chest or sell his accomplishments
6786456 i look at your track record and judge a tree by its fruit
6786457 look at the labor deal we have and i dont think the players are against it
6786458 our resolve as a union is not going to change
6786459 unfortunately we lost a great leader you hope that there will be some very qualified people calling and asking for that position when the time is right the process will take care of itself
6786460 he was not only my leader and my mentor but one of the best friends ive ever had thats why this is so emotional were obviously dealing on a day to day basis while we go through the grieving process
6786461 we have opened 39 stores this year and continue to make the investments necessary to build the zumiez chain to our goal of 800 stores
6786462 that said the macro environment remains challenging and retailers are becoming increasingly promotional
6786463 therefore we believe it is prudent to adopt a more conservative outlook for the back half of the year

6786704 perhaps the best deal for gm would be to procure smaller chinese suvs and turn the hummer brand into an economical suv brand
6786705 follow the perfidious operation where a number of young mujahedeen have been killed
6786706 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison
6786707 while the three partners had agreed to the commercial morrison vehemently disagreed and the commercial was not done
6786708 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6786709 oh yeah theres duff hes with velvet revolver he was in guns n roses like 20 years ago
6786710 it was pretty obvious to us that it was intentionally set based on what we found inside
6786711 with peak oil and all the environmental and economic concerns its more of a done deal now
6786712 electric is the way to go car manufacturers will realize this or die
6786713 you can buy a zenn in 42 states but not in most of canada
6786714 but i believe it is possible and it is vital and i will be seeking the support of party members to achieve this
6786715 fully committed to zero tolerance of illegal drug use and trafficking in prisons
6786716 i know i am fully supported by the scottish prisons service
6786717 the harsh fact is that two thirds of those who enter prison have a drug problem and their crime is often associated with funding their addiction
6786718 nevertheless drugs in prison will not be tolerated nor will it be accepted as an inevitable fact of life irrespective of the present difficulties
6786719 die kapazit tsgrenze liegt zwischen 1500 und 1800 fahrzeugen pro stunde und spur

6786722 not only can it transform old or damaged leather suites but it can protect it too from pets children wine and food even better weve made it really easy to buy it online with a simple five stage buying process that you can see on our website
6786723 its a very 21st century solution to an old problem
6786724 the half leather half fabric style is very trendy very designer at the minute so this is a highly cost effective way of achieving that look
6786725 there is huge waste and loss of water through food that is produced since roughly 50 percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
6786726 there is a need for a mentality shift it would make a lot of sense for people to waste less
6786727 that corresponds to 40 trillion liters of irrigation water enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6786728 in many areas of the world you simply cannot store food efficiently because it is not handled well
6786729 in urban settings we have lost touch with realities people do not know where food comes from they do not know what it takes to produce food
6786730 now if you throw away half of that kilo that means youve thrown away 7 5 tons of water
6786731 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
6786732 gone down by 30 percent because the price went up
6786733 we pay a price here for water that is not very high but we also couple that with education and awareness so people know there is a cost to the environment to use that water

6786737 the key to success in biofuels is how much biomass you can grow and how quickly
6786738 for biofuels production were talking about a rotation length of less than 10 years not the 15 to 30 years as for other wood products
6786739 maybe the reduced lignin content of the wood will be less important for these short growth cycles compared to trees that live for longer periods of time
6786740 this could be a big thing for rural areas especially in north carolina where more than 60 percent of rural land is forest
6786741 theres no silver bullet to solve the energy problem but these trees could be an added product for rural communities
6786742 proiectul nabucco ramane viabil romania se va ralia initiativei turciei de creare a unei forte de descurajare a terorismului in zona marii negre

6786744 no podr competir con yankilandia por falta de medios y de distribuci n
6786745 habla de mujeres y de la vida y supongo que en estados unidos tambi n tendr n este tipo de conflictos
6786746 cuando hablas de sentimientos y del ser humano y al contrario cuando hablas de algo muy peque o y muy local es cuando m s trasciende

6786748 la relaci n con la madre una relaci n con su padre que la ancla al pasado la relaci n con los hombres y su relaci n con la amistad
6786749 todo un lujo para una actriz que de repente se encuentra con muchas opciones para expresar muchas cosas
6786750 creo que es una peli especial contada de una manera especial y con mucha pasi n que obliga al espectador a no estar relajado
6786751 la sensaci n de que en la pel cula hab a la necesidad de contar esta historia del modo en el que se ha hecho
6786752 the media have been used to promote cigarettes and smoking through infamous advertising icons such as the marlboro man and joe camel and through tobacco images in hollywood movies
6786753 the media have also been used to increase smoking cessation and reduce smoking initiation through paid advertising campaigns and public service announcements about the dangers of smoking
6786754 presents the most current and comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence on the impact of these forces and other media exposures on beliefs attitudes and behaviours concerning tobacco use
6786755 this report sends a loud and clear message to policy makers we need less tobacco company marketing and more anti tobacco advertising
6786756 it shows why we need strong regulation of tobacco products and their marketing to prevent tobacco companies from continuing to target our children it also should prompt states to fully fund tobacco prevention and cessation campaigns that are proven to work and it should spur governments worldwide to implement the international tobacco control treaty which calls on governments to ban all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship and fund effective public education campaigns
6786757 im very glad that the federal government has thrown its weight behind this important issue
6786758 i reached out and his people got snap sienna millers rather glum north london residence asian world gangs up on glitter molester tricked back to england just released from a vietnam prison convicted

6786765 die organisatoren haben fantastische arbeit geleistet valencia ist eine gro artige strecke
6786766 sie hat einen ziemlich glatten asphalt und es wird ein vergn gen sein hier rennen zu fahren wir gingen ziemlich fr h mit neuen reifen auf die strecke und die strecke verbesserte sich gegen ende der einheit deutlich
6786767 es ist wirklich schwierig zu sagen aber ich denke dass die strecke zu unserem auto passt wir m ssen abwarten und schauen was morgen und im rennen passiert in bezug auf das setup haben wir heute betr chtliche fortschritte erzielt was gut ist
6786768 die longruns waren gut aber wir m ssen noch etwas mehr geschwindigkeit finden wenn wir auf neuen reifen auf der strecke sind die bedingungen haben sich die ganze zeit ber ver ndert und die strecke wurde im verlauf der einheit einfacher zu fahren
6786769 es ist nicht die einfachste strecke ich bin aus diesem grund froh dass ich mich im vorfeld intensiv im simulator vorbereitet habe bevor ich hierher gekommen bin ich bin vor dem morgigen qualifying positiv gestimmt
6786770 wir verloren durch seinen dreher einen reifen satz bei nico und wir haben ganz offensichtlich gl ck dass wir ohne eine besch digung des autos davon gekommen sind
6786771 abgesehen davon haben wir uns durch unser programm gearbeitet und ber die reifen gute informationen gesammelt w hrend wir longruns durchgef hrt haben wir sind aus diesem grund ber die heute erledigte arbeit gl cklich
6786772 exactly the main question is where there is nothing left anymore
6786773 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6786774 it will be a special game for all of inter
6786775 we all want to have a great game and bring home the first trophy of the season
6786776 well definitely win because were in great form and a very strong inter is emerging
6786777 zealots may reveal dedication and idealism but those factors are not enough to guarantee success and victory
6786778 i think that everything is possible as long as you put your mind to it and you put the work and time into it i think your mind really controls everything
6786779 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6786780 would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6786781 der faschismus lockte mit bindung und f hrung der kommunismus lockte mit bindung und hoffnung
6786782 der neue liberalismus der heute vertretbar ist fordert einen starken staat einen staat oberhalb der wirtschaft oberhalb der interessen da wo er hingeh rt
6786783 das erstrebenswerte ziel bleibt in jedem fall die freie auf echtem leistungswettbewerb beruhende marktwirtschaft
6786784 ob wenig oder mehr staatst tigkeit diese frage geht am wesentlichen vorbei es handelt sich nicht um ein quantitatives sondern ein qualitatives problem
6786785 der wohlfahrtsstaat legt wert darauf dass er zu jedem b rger ein druckrohr leitet durch das er ihm seine wohlfahrtsleistungen zupumpt zugleich aber hat er in der geldtasche jedes staatsb rgers ein saugrohr die funktion des staates besteht nun darin dass ganze ungeheure r hrensystem in t tigkeit zu setzen mit unheimlichen maschinenger uschen und betr chtlichen energie und materialverlusten

6786789 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others

6786794 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system
6786795 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6786796 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to nuclear attack one hundred percent
6786797 russia will have to point its warheads at ukrainian territory
6786798 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6786799 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6786800 the weak are not loved and not heard they are insulted and when we have nuclear parity they will talk to us in a different way

6786804 we are pleased to see agreement to fund dps from general revenue instead of gas taxes the public expects to be spent on road construction
6786805 we urge the department to establish objective criteria and be diligent in separating needs from wants so that money is not squandered on pet projects that do little to address mobility as with all taxpayer funds these large amounts of money must be carefully prioritized to get maximum benefit for the taxpayers
6786806 create a transportation finance corporation or similar entity that will allow public texas based investment funds to invest directly in texas transportation projects that offer a potential solid long term return
6786807 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
6786808 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
6786809 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
6786810 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
6786811 i dont see how they came up with their numbers
6786812 but i just doodled them out and sent them in
6786813 they immediately responded saying if you can get these made well put them through
6786814 i said oh thats right the city owns the sidewalks
6786815 somebody hinted to the department of transportation that the city might get negative publicity
6786816 shes definitely low culture but theres nothing obscene about it and in a way it acknowledges times squares seedy past i heard that janette had to go to bloomberg just to make sure it was o k
6786817 i dont think people are going to switch over to bikes because its good for them or because its politically correct theyre going to do it because it gets them from a to b faster
6786818 it feels good if the weathers o k and if you see something that interests you you just stop
6786819 the new york city department of transportation is not necessarily known for its cool reputation
6786820 now its cool in different ways for some people its cool if you have an old junker for other people its cool if you have a racing bike
6786821 anyway it doesnt immediately relegate you to nerd status anymore

6786833 danish kaneria suffered a small fracture on the end of a finger attempting to take a return catch on day two of the match
6786834 he saw a hand specialist on friday morning at broomfield hospital in chelmsford for a second opinion on the best management of the injury
6786835 it was decided he needs an operation and will miss the rest of the english county season
6786836 the only area left for discussion is whether danish will have the operation in england or back in pakistan
6786837 danishs injury is a big blow to us because hes a world class performer and has been a massive part of our success
6786838 but we have a good replacement in tim phillips who has played a big part for us in one day games in previous years so this is a good opportunity for him to show what he can do

6786845 todo un lujo para una actriz que de repente se encuentra con muchas opciones para expresar muchas cosas
6786846 creo que es una peli especial contada de una manera especial y con mucha pasi n que obliga al espectador a no estar relajado
6786847 la sensaci n de que en la pel cula hab a la necesidad de contar esta historia del modo en el que se ha hecho

6786853 no es que hayan pasado ocho a os y no nos hayamos visto
6786854 su pasi n su gusto por contar historias su inteligencia y una sensibilidad especial que la hace funcionar
6786855 ha provocado la suspensi n de la ley de consulta
6786856 queda m s claro el hecho de que se est utilizando el tribunal constitucional como instrumento del poder del ejecutivo espa ol
6786857 de que para el 15 de septiembre tienen un empe o especial tanto el psoe como el pp de cerrar todo eso que se denomina causas que afectan al hecho pol tico vasco
6786858 parece que quieren resolver antes de iniciar el nuevo a o judicial
6786859 despu s eso deja abiertas otra serie de v as ante el tribunal de derechos humanos de estrasburgo y otras instancias o instituciones europeas
6786860 en lo que se refiere al recorrido judicial evidentemente tienes que rematar todo el cauce dentro del estado para recurrir a instancias judiciales europeas despu s existen otras instancias m s pol ticas
6786861 el comparativo de calidad democr tica de poso democr tico que ofrecen los gobernantes en el estado espa ol y en europa es radicalmente distinta

6786863 weve also got a lot of players coming back thats going to provide good leadership along with experience
6786864 we have a good senior class that has the potential to lead us through the battles and a great junior class that numbers wise make up the heart of our team
6786865 its going to be a challenge for us but were ready and excited to get the season started
6786866 the change in dance music is that now everyone has a laptop and everyone can get a cracked copy of ableton so suddenly everyone is making what i call ableton techno and you get all these pedestrian records that just use the default sounds
6786867 when something is so common and easy to make it has no value any more i have to be careful as i always end up pissing people off who like that kind of thing but i could be grumpy about it for hours

6786874 this team is young on paper but a lot of girls got a lot of quality playing time last season which will be a big factor to our success
6786875 those four seniors helped us establish ourselves as a program and stabilize us as a solid big ten team but now its time to turn the page to a new chapter and our girls are ready to accept that challenge
6786876 this team has a great opportunity to really make a name for itself and not have to look back on past years successes
6786877 were as athletic a team as ive had in a long time and as long as we can do the little things that it takes to be successful and continue to work on our consistency if we can do what it takes to fuse all those aspects together this team could set itself up to accomplish big things
6786878 our goal is always to win the big ten but we understand it is a process
6786879 whether thats in 2008 2009 or 2010 it is always our goal its more than a one year goal its something you build toward i look at this team and what we have and if we can speed up the maturing process were going to have a great year

6786889 other than john darer no one seems to be doing anything
6786890 thank you for being the inspiration that you are and for being a strong advocate for integrity in our business
6786891 i commend you on your effort to make a difference
6786892 he is a fabulous writer who has a great passion for the structured settlement industry i commend him on the passion he invokes when he writes on his blog listed above that type of commitment and passion is hard to find and is rare in this world
6786893 i love your weblog keep me on your e mail list
6786894 well done john that is an outstanding piece of work
6786895 i just read your blog about bair vs darer great stuff
6786896 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6786897 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6786898 one of obamas biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion
6786899 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6786900 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6786901 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6786902 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
6786903 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6786904 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6786905 im happy just to get here and get a medal but im not happy because i practised with 11 guys i trained with 11 guys i got to know 11 guys for a whole year and my expectations were all of us to medal
6786906 so for me just to get a medal is a good thing but at the same time im not happy because im not the kind of guy who likes to shine in the light
6786907 i didnt come here by myself i was looking forward to having guys celebrate with me
6786908 in the future youre going to see greatness of me youre looking at the future mark my words

6786945 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6786946 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6786947 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6786948 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has

6786951 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6786952 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6786953 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6786954 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6786955 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6786956 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6786957 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6786958 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6786959 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6786960 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6786961 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6786962 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6786963 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6786964 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6786965 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6786966 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6786967 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6786968 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6786969 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6786970 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6786971 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6786972 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6786973 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6786974 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6786975 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6786976 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6786977 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6786978 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6786979 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6786980 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6786981 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6786982 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6786983 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6786984 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6786985 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6786986 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6786987 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6786988 i know at the beginning of the year they counted on me and up to this point its been a massive fail
6786989 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
6786990 they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance
6786991 why didnt i ever consider that being at least a possibility
6786992 you can set russias recent invasion of georgia and israels concern over irans nuclear aspirations on the back burner not that these topics lack importance
6786993 the stage is not adequately set for the highly publicized ezekiel 38 and 39 russian iranian nuclear equipped consortia of nations to invade israel psalm 83 comes first and then ezekiel 38 follows on its heels like a goliath shadow there are two distinct invasions of israel one building upon the other with both occurring sequentially in the middle east
6786994 spark a cold war like military build up in the middle east by sending war ships and advanced weaponry to foe syria
6786995 seeking a seat on the iaea board of governors a 35 member forum that could decide that syria violated its obligations since most of the decisions in this body are made by consensus syria would thus insure itself against condemnation
6786996 jerusalem will be returned to the palestinians not by way of negotiations or hugging and kissing the enemy but through blood shahids and resistance
6786997 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6786998 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6786999 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6787000 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6787001 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6787002 i am trying to spread the word about my story you can do anything you want after surviving cancer if you have cancer it is not the end if you are lucky there is a whole world out there for you still
6787003 before the games i was fantasizing about winning the gold medal because you have to fantasize 100 times about something before you can win it i was thinking i would be jumping up and down or screaming but when it came to it i just finished and felt amazed
6787004 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6787005 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6787006 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6787007 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6787008 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6787009 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6787010 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6787011 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6787012 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6787013 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6787014 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6787015 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6787016 who are open to doing something on the production side
6787017 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6787018 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6787019 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

6787022 the diesel version is overwhelmingly easy to drive thanks to its tremendous torque which is available over an even broader rev band it outperforms the petrol powered car in terms of controllability over challenging terrain as well as when accelerating out of corners and along high speed straights with the right set up it would be comfortably faster
6787023 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6787024 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6787025 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6787026 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6787027 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6787028 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6787029 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6787030 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6787039 he seems to be a person who can deal with people across the aisle and compromise his whole demeanor i like that about him
6787040 but when you start digging theres not much below the surface other than what youve been hearing the last 30 years
6787041 the vice presidential selection will play a big role along with the debates
6787042 whenever i see him talking hes making full eye contact hes not evasive he seems closer to genuine
6787043 i think mccain will do something more than what bush has done
6787044 do you really believe theres going to be a victory i still feel hes going to do something to help those boys get back
6787045 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6787046 so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6787047 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6787048 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6787049 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6787050 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6787051 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6787052 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6787053 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6787054 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6787055 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6787056 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6787057 when it was pointed out that mccains pronouncements on the economy often do not conform to his official positions the candidates chief economic adviser indicated that we should pay attention to the authorized version despite the fact that mccain

6787082 i think they wanted the producers of this film the sort of sensibility which i had in the films titanic and shall we dance the sorts of scoring that i was doing in those movies which people are familiar in here in india so i think it wont be as big shock as some people thought it will be but yes it has a different approach

6787089 the professions have a certain undeniable effect upon the professors they make the people who practise them possessive jealous of any infringement of their rights and highly combative
6787090 to emphasize superiority rouses competition and jealousy which encourage a disposition towards war we can refuse all such distinctions ourselves
6787091 education far from teaching the educated generosity and magnanimity makes them on the contrary to anxious to keep their possessions that they will use much subtler methods than force when they are asked to share them and are not force and possessiveness very closely connected with war

6787121 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6787122 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6787123 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6787124 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6787456 wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work that goes on it adds up

6787468 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49kg and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
6787469 a lot of dangers and lot of big questions marks

6787481 so the world is at the edge as the bush presidency winds down new directions are promised in europe old habits die hard in china and russia and all the while the middle east gets more petromoney and crazier for it
6787482 here at home if we keep paying out petrobribes to unsavory nations piling up debt to china and japan run serial deficits lose iraq and accept stalemate in afghanistan surge to 20 million or so illegal immigrants and suffer another 9 11 attack then expect the world to become a far more dangerous place as a poorer more isolationist america retreats inside an ever thinner more fragile shell

6787491 he realizes that he realizes his responsibilities theres no more class act than derek jeter derek jeters not the kind to not give 110 percent and thats in anything

6787511 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6787512 were not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada
6787513 at this point we are counting on petro canada to have their processing unit back up within a reasonable time so that these closures will be temporary we have not made any decisions beyond that
6787514 you might see an impact if you had numerous refineries with an issue like this but so far i dont think that weve noticed any effect on the price
6787515 its great if youre a refinery because it blocks competition and helps you keep our prices up
6787516 but its not good for consumers and at times like this its not good for our operations either because we cant get any gas
6787517 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6787518 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6787519 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6787520 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6787521 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6787522 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6787548 what im describing is a culture its not so much a capability that you need this or that
6787549 its a culture where commanders know they have authority to react to requests or circumstances which would suggest that a crisis is about to unfold
6787550 what im saying to commanders is that as a culture of operation anticipate lean forward in order to ensure that canadians know that the canadian forces can support them
6787551 the canadian forces are here to support all the other government departments in the arctic and weve got to be able to fill any of the blind spots those departments may have
6787552 im expecting to have some more cases reported yes definitely
6787553 outside of the 40 year old pregnant female all the cases have been definitely over 50 mostly 60 and 70
6787554 i think that if someone has concern in those high risk categories or if theyre feeling unwell and they think they have ingested that we would encourage them to see their family physician
6787555 its reasonable to say that well get more cases related to the outbreak
6787556 what were striving to do is actually do a more proactive role within the plant situation
6787557 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself
6787558 weve increased our surveillance and monitoring of any fevers or high temperatures or sore necks those kinds of symptoms
6787559 obviously we are now aware that the symptom of a headache could be not only just a headache or a flu like symptom could not only just be flu but it could be listeria
6787560 a lot of people are unsure about what they may have bought and whether or not its part of the recall

6787576 i dont really smoke as much as i used to and im just looking after myself a bit better for me and my children i just want to live forever man i dont want to be not well
6787577 we dont really speak that much theres nothing to say
6787578 we speak if the music aint right we sort of pull each other aside and go look youre doing that wrong or youre doing that right and thats it really we see enough of each other on the stage
6787579 im cool with it theres things he dont like about me theres things i dont like about him i refuse to be like him and he refuses to be like me
6787580 the minute you tell someone someone tells that and then you end up paranoid and blaming people so i thought the best way to do it was to tell no one
6787581 were not god heads and we dont go to church or anything
6787582 its just were talking about love life religion death but not in a morbid way angels and shit like that it is what it is
6787583 people are sort of going on about this tribute to john lennon its not a tribute to john
6787584 if i tried to write a song about john lennon itd sound ridiculous so its just a song man you know people will have to get what they get from it you know what i mean i hate when people say its about this its about that because instantly people stop using their imagination and you just look for that
6787585 im the only whos doing that everyones throwing moves and throwing their arms about
6787586 im sick of all these everyone thats in a band these days as soon as they open their mouth their hands go up in the air they all think theyre jumping jack flash man

6787592 weve definitely lost 20 percent of the population this year and probably more
6787593 we have rangers with them and were trying to reinforce them but the rangers are outnumbered 20 to one
6787594 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6787595 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6787596 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6787597 i think the media has made a whole lot of nonsense out of absolutely nothing and has gone on speculation and gossip
6787598 weve been respecting the process and making sure we have all the proper permits
6787599 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans

6787609 fda unleashes mass irradiation of spinach lettuce and other vegetables
6787610 given some support to the myths and misperceptions we spend an inordinate amount of time telling people wont happen
6787611 he didnt deserve to be like that to go that way
6787612 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6787613 t he broadband access gap between sub saharan africa and the rest of the world is getting wider just as the gap in basic voice communications is getting smaller

6787619 if somebody thinks that people will be satisfied after musharrafs removal let me tell you that people want the rule of law
6787620 wednesday should not be considered the final word there could be a delay of a day or two but you will see results in a week or so
6787621 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6787622 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6787623 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6787624 i want to assure parents and others in this community that despite this tragic and isolated incident that our schools are safe
6787625 i wish to god that i could answer that persistent question that i have heard all day long
6787626 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6787627 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom
6787628 everybody started running out real fast saying he got shot
6787629 we along with alberta are going to be most impacted
6787630 this so called solution for the environment is no solution at all for nova scotia
6787631 but we dont believe taxing people is the way to do it
6787632 ive indicated to them my displeasure with the thought of a carbon tax and that if they were thinking about it i would fight it tooth and nail
6787633 i am certain that cbc ctv talk radio or other media outlets could be approached and would be receptive to hosting such a debate which i would like to have at the earliest opportunity
6787634 no honey that minimal investment doesnt make me look cheap its just your exceptionally high burn rate showing
6787635 the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6787636 obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6787637 by a court that is not free and is heavily influenced by those who are simply scared of freeing mikhail khodorkovsky
6787638 all the lawyers that i had talked to they tell me you dont have a chance in this thing they just will not give you exemption so im very happy that they have given me exemption
6787639 we were trying to use the sensible approach to this thing and look at and try to figure out what a reasonable person would do
6787640 they didnt include the grandchildren so after i die then theyre going to be in the same boat the thing has been resolved somewhat but i didnt want my children to go through what i had to go through for eight years battling with the farm land security board
6787641 the one thing i asked them to do was bring a common sense approach to this
6787642 this should have been done a long time ago this is not a big issue should not have been a big issue and weve made it that way as government by dragging our feet and not dealing with it
6787643 i tell you my mom had such a love for saskatchewan
6787644 in light of the conclusions in the report and the history of advocacy in this province its not clear that that should be one of the priorities
6787645 crime victims are often the forgotten individuals of the criminal justice system and are sometimes treated with less attention respect and sensitivity than they deserve
6787646 the rights of the victims of crime have never been a priority for premier dalton mcguintys government
6787647 the only time when they took any action to do anything for them was when they were dragged kicking and screaming into doing it by the ombudsmans report
6787648 the office of a victim advocate as an officer of the legislative assembly would address all of the concerns that victims have had and permit the legislature to receive non partisan guidance on a regular basis of where the gaps are in the system
6787649 we are as mr mcmurtry says a leader and a model for other jurisdictions
6787650 i walk to work i walk back from work im at home at 6 oclock in my pyjamas watching television
6787651 its important to be aware of whats going on in your medium
6787652 it gives you an indication of what youre doing right and wrong or gives you something to shake your fist at in defiance
6787653 ive loved television since i was old enough to reach the dial
6787654 television is meaningful to me its frustrating and fascinating all at the same time
6787655 i watched the guys warm up and its hot out there
6787656 i just sat there with my cooling vest on listening to music and just chilled out i think that really paid off
6787657 the majority are using it to block out everything else thats going on around them
6787658 essentially what theyre doing is really not thinking at all theyre just listening to music and being in a space before they actually get ready to narrow their focus
6787659 you have to also plan for contingency if you forgot your music or something happens
6787660 for many athletes that point in time would have been a turning point to really underperform
6787661 kevin drew and broken social scene brendan canning those guys jason collett all the guys from broken social scene thats my favourite band probably
6787662 but to relax myself when im preparing to come to competition i like to listen to some upbeat music
6787663 not before the dives because im the type of guy wholl keep the song in my head and lose focus on what im supposed to think about
6787664 im very electronic techno house music really gets me going
6787665 to start warming up its very helpful it gives me a lot of energy and gets me pumped heading into the warm up and into the meet
6787666 maybe 10 or 15 minutes before i get ready to warm up i dont do a lot of running with an ipod
6787667 i dont let my athletes have headphones and things while theyre warming up i think you have to focus on what youre doing
6787668 you do not isolate your brain from whats important thats just my idea and i know some people think its an old fashioned old man talk
6787669 theres already a seed or root set at a much earlier point and people may not be aware of these seeds
6787670 are indeed consciously accessible in the sense that they produce some kind of positive or negative gut reaction
6787671 people can feel those gut reactions but what people arent aware of is how these automatic associations influence their perceptions of reality that is where the unconscious part comes in
6787672 he believed that he was making a difference and making things better for people over there
6787673 he loved his girls and it was very hard for him to go away
6787674 stephan was loved by so many people his circle of friends stretch from coast to coast and his family both here and in ireland
6787675 stephan believed in canadas mission he died proud and brave doing what he felt was right
6787676 he wanted his friends to have no fear for him because he had no fear of the mission in afghanistan we truly believe that if he came home safe that he would request to return for another tour
6787677 hes the third person ive known thats died over there on that tour just makes you wonder whats going to go on in the future
6787678 he always had this strong spirit about him when the times got tough he would always do things to show people that things could be worse
6787679 he just wanted to make a difference and believe that he was doing right and he had the support from his family and friends and that he was doing the right thing
6787680 i think that he when he signed up for it he knew there was going to be a risk
6787681 canadas commitment to peace and security in afghanistan remains resolute
6787682 we will not allow the taliban to deter us from continuing to help afghans rebuild their country
6787683 it is hitting close to home for people that did know them and it is hitting close to home for those who didnt
6787684 they were getting close to the end of their tour the rotos troop rotation were going to starting coming back in the next month or a bit something like this really just kind of sends a pall over the place
6787685 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6787686 the situation in the theatre has deteriorated over the summer and this is another reflection of that
6787687 he loved his girls and it was very hard for him to go away
6787688 he just wanted to make a difference and believe that he was doing right and he had the support from his family and friends and that he was doing the right thing
6787689 exceptional canadians who made a selfless choice to serve their nation
6787690 the difference is theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6787691 our soldiers believe in this mission they know what this is all about
6787692 at the end of the day the taliban are against things theyre not for anything theyre against human rights theyre against education theyre against health care theyre against women theyre just against human decency so if we leave these people if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6787693 we have incredible leaders and we learn from these events and we learn from the incidents and apply them to try and stay ahead of this enemy
6787694 they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission
6787695 are they effective theyre slowing them down will we still see devices in culverts yes
6787696 the only way you can stop an insurgent from doing what an insurgent does is putting a 24 hour watch on the target we cant do that
6787697 because of the irrigation problems and the wet season and all that other stuff theres culverts all over the place for drainage

6787702 i looked at his call log tony and i both laughed at that we got a chuckle out of it
6787703 the economy has changed dramatically and people just arent eating out as much anymore
6787704 people are cutting back everywhere and a lot of companies including cafe dupri are feeling the effect
6787705 for the past two months business at the cafe has been down and if the business isnt making money i feel its a smart move to shut it down bottom line if it doesnt make money it doesnt make sense
6787706 the pillows are big enough to accommodate human heads pets and assorted wide loads
6787707 payments were made for corrupt ends by an intermediary of alstom prom ag located in baden
6787708 these sums were transferred by other companies of the alstom group to public servants or officials of various countries in cases determining the awarding of contracts
6787709 findings in the current investigation suggest that the case may be broadened

6787711 increases in the number of imaging scanners over the last few years mean that the majority currently installed and in use in canada are less than six years old
6787712 these newer machines are using the latest technology to produce more detailed scans
6787713 its just not socially acceptable anymore to the degree it was two decades ago to get behind the wheel of a car after drinking
6787714 this isnt something that is dropping off the table and were shifting our focus
6787715 the police opp ontario provincial police and community city forces are as determined as ever and the laws are as tough as ever
6787716 so basically what you have is a growing de facto decriminalization of impaired driving
6787717 what is supported by the research is the growing reluctance of police to lay the charge and the incredible burden on crowns
6787718 they take drinking and driving seriously and they enforce it rigorously
6787719 were expecting police to ultimately be the protectors out there they can only do so much
6787720 it really is an efficient and a quick way to get drivers off the road
6787721 right now thats a violation of our rights and police arent allowed to do that
6787722 but really why shouldnt they be able to stop anybody and ask for a sample at any time if youre not impaired you are just helping to protect everybody else
6787723 i think a good start would be for the province to take a much tougher line on actually enforcing the laws and the sentences that are there and plea bargain a lot less frequently

6787733 oprah has told the editors at o magazine shes tired of being on the cover every month its a pain
6787734 it takes a lot of time and energy and shes sick of it shes given them six months to figure out what to do without her
6787735 just because we werent in the spotlight doesnt mean we werent making moves
6787736 these last four years were spent traveling doing shows all over the world writing and working with other artists weve really had time to mature into women and master our craft it shows lyrically and vocally on this album
6787737 we arent only singers we write all of our music
6787738 nicole plays guitar and deejays we are very musical and try to show this while on stage our vibe isnt like your typical group because nicole deejays shes able to command the crowd and every once and a while well bring the guitar out on stage to show our versatility
6787739 were so excited about the music weve recorded for this album weve grown so much in the last few years and experienced love heartbreak fun times sad times and everything in between the content on the musical is really reflective of our personal experiences
6787740 were giving our fans a glimpse into our lives as nicole and natalie also the production on this album is extremely tight we worked with some of the most talented writers and producers in the industry the album is a pop r amp b album with a hip hop base its very true to who we are and is finely crafted we cant wait to release it
6787741 we grew up in a household where music was always played our dad deejayed from sunrise to sunset its because of him that we learned to appreciate all genres of music and have always been open to experimenting with different sounds and vibes
6787742 when we auditioned for cipha we didnt know what to expect but he embraced our performance and soon after asked us to hit the studio with him
6787743 at our first session he played us the coolie dance riddim and within 30 minutes of hearing it and vibing out wed written
6787744 we had no idea what would come of it but he kept saying the song was gonna be big same way he believed in us we believed in him and the song took off
6787745 when we were signed to universal records we always felt disconnected they didnt understand us as a group and didnt give us the proper attention a label should give any artist they are trying to propel to success
6787746 after our last situation ended we knew it was important to sign with someone who believed in us our movement and our music from the beginning bryan leach got it it was as if he was a part of our team even prior to signing to his label
6787747 we entered into the green label sound program because we saw it as an opportunity to put a song out to the whole world with the backing of something that everyone grew up on
6787748 mountain dew is not trying to push their product through music like everyone else they just wanna support music and with us tying to set up our new record without a record company mountain dew gives us an unexpected helping hand to get up those steps
6787749 listening to family force 5 is like lighting a cluster of firecrackers in your mouth
6787750 this album provides a connection and an escape and its guaranteed to make your booty shake and your head bang its greasy slimy and soupy yet still very slick and shiny at the same time
6787751 the last record was a straight up party but we always said the second would be sweaty rock n roll music
6787752 the album title and imagery transport the listener into a dire life or death situation each song unites that urgency with a danceable beat so get to steppin or youll be extinct
6787753 we encourage fans to dress up in costumes whether it be a killer whale a big chicken or a skeletor outfit
6787754 family force 5 realizes that most people think rock n roll is about trying to be cool but to us theres nothing cooler than when people let go and end up stealing the show by break dancing in helmets or body slamming each other in lucha libre masks
6787755 it is the only fully functional giant drum machine in the universe its a six and a half foot tall 760 pound juggernaut of pads knobs and switches that inhales electricity and exhales lightning
6787756 the family force 5000 started as a joke three years ago then we mentioned it to a friend who happens to be a wizard in electronics and he was able to bring our sci fi idea to life the fact that we have a huge light up chunky machine on stage is pretty cool and it adds to the robotic rock element of this season

6787793 se adoptaron todas las medidas de seguridad que se pudieron tomar
6787794 ya que no se puede olvidar que el piloto siempre es el primer interesado en la seguridad del veh culo que lidera puesto que va en primera fila del mismo
6787795 es el medio m s seguro que existe ya que los aviones sufren un examen cada d a y otro antes de cada vuelo aunque casos como ste sean m s espectaculares que los que se cobran las carreteras de nuestro pa s cada d a

6787817 nist did not test for the presence of explosive residue and such tests would not necessarily have been conclusive
6787818 our analysis shows that even the smallest explosive charge that was capable of bringing down the critical column in the building had it occurred we would have seen sound levels of 120 to 130 dbs a half a mile away that could have been an incredibly loud sound and that sound

6787831 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6787832 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6787833 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6787834 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
6787835 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6787836 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6787837 i dont want to disrespect marc s name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it

6787847 it was an interesting day for us to run on a new track
6787848 the circuit is very challenging but feels more like a permanent race track than a street circuit as it has lots of run off areas and long straights and very smooth asphalt it was however difficult in the morning with lots of dust and very hard to get a good lap out of it in the afternoon it was better but it was still quite dusty and once you got a little bit off line you got no grip at all everything was really as normal with a standard programme with the tyres we have some issues with graining as usual but overall i am quite pleased with the day the seamless shift is a very good step and i was happy with the progress
6787849 today we ran through our normal programme even though it was a new circuit its a pretty good track nice to drive although it was very dirty and slippery in the morning we had a very good second session with some quick times and made some strong progress on the set up the seamless box is working well and we can push quite hard but lets see what happens for tomorrow and qualifying
6787850 generally an interesting day for us as it is always challenging to run at a new circuit and particularly one that stretches the drivers we had no real mechanical problems today only a small brake issue with giancarlo which was very quickly solved all in all we ran through our normal programme and tyre evaluation and although its hard to tell from friday form i think we look more competitive and have made a slight step forward that well look to carry over to the rest of the weekend

6787857 it is silly shes in no way my muse but she is one of the great american actresses
6787858 this is certainly the good fallout from that high k metal gate breakthrough
6787859 that certainly makes it easier to carve off a chunk of their existing design and repurpose it without having to create a whole new architecture
6787860 could we have hit a small core design of course would it have been a competitive product i think 45nm has been very important to hitting the performance level at the required power
6787861 you have to look at power consumption both the thermal design power as well as idle power
6787862 the other thing thats almost more important particularly in mids is the current leakage and we got a huge reduction in leakage from high k and metal gate
6787863 as good as the processors are thats not even the primary source of power consumption in the platform bringing all the peripherals together gives us the ability to intelligently manage the platform which is key to getting it into the smaller form factors
6787864 so much of the ecosystem from the desktop or laptop side can be ported right over to the mid and retain the experience
6787865 a lot of people in the embedded systems market are real excited to get x86 level performance without requiring a fan

6787905 considering three days ago i didnt even know if i was even going to dive that is good
6787906 it hurt in one of my dives and it affected the actual dive but you have to get on with it as these things are sent to test you

6787920 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
6787921 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
6787922 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences

6788022 mum took me down to the local canoe club when i was 10 and i loved it so much i never looked back

6788032 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible

6788035 cuando hablas de sentimientos y del ser humano y al contrario cuando hablas de algo muy peque o y muy local es cuando m s trasciende
6788036 un personaje muy rico con un mont n de cosas que lo hacen muy apetecible
6788037 la relaci n con la madre una relaci n con su padre que la ancla al pasado la relaci n con los hombres y su relaci n con la amistad
6788038 todo un lujo para una actriz que de repente se encuentra con muchas opciones para expresar muchas cosas
6788039 creo que es una peli especial contada de una manera especial y con mucha pasi n que obliga al espectador a no estar relajado
6788040 la sensaci n de que en la pel cula hab a la necesidad de contar esta historia del modo en el que se ha hecho
6788041 cuando uno crea algo es porque siente la necesidad de contar ese algo
6788042 no s qu fue primero si el huevo o la gallina

6788051 during the fence i could barely stay in my own skin
6788052 if you had told me id only fence four victories i would have said thats impossible no one can fence that poorly halfway through i just looked up and my sister caught my eye i looked up at her and hugged her and said i cant do it ive gotta walk off
6788053 she looked at me and said you cannot want you cannot want and i said thank you i told her shes an angel from god those are words god delivered right through you it immediately released any frustration it was true contentment and peace and it went well the rest of the day
6788054 i didnt walk off like i hadnt walked away all three years of this and im so thankful it ended on the most beautiful note even though it wasnt a medal finish it was a beautiful note to end on
6788055 i cant deny it this horse was amazing he had already gone two times he was so sweaty and tired this poor horse and he had the biggest heart in the world you could tell he was trying so hard

6788062 when i did my first album i said that when i did a second i wanted gary to write for me i think he is a great songwriter one of britains best songwriters i love take that so it was always a dream of mine that hed write for me
6788063 he said it was fantastic i hope in future gary will play when i sing
6788064 when i was contacted by bryn about performing at the festival i said i would like whoever won the nancy role to sing in concert with me
6788065 i think its important that we help promote the people we choose to win i backed jodie really quietly for the whole time as i really believed in her when people see her do other things they will realise what a star she really is
6788066 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
6788067 but this year i hadnt finalised my schedule for torchwood so i told them to make sure i could have time off to do it
6788068 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
6788069 we moved from cardiff bay to the beach i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here
6788070 i love the people and the place we decided to have our civil partnership in cardiff and the response we got from people was unbelievable our neighbours in sully are wonderful i feel at home here
6788071 we have a house in london because we still work in london but our main house is in wales
6788072 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6788073 ooh i dont know you will have to watch they are talking about it i would like to see a year hiatus before theres another one you need to put a pause on something when you have such a good thing going rather than flog it like a dead horse
6788074 it was the highest rated show on the bbc that evening ive had a huge response to people saying theyre more open minded now
6788075 teenagers have written to me and said theyre more comfortable with coming out now some were on the brink of suicide but changed their minds im really pleased with that
6788076 theres nothing wrong with who i am or being gay and i wanted people to see that there are always people who wont like me but all i ask is people respect me

6788081 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6788082 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6788083 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6788084 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6788085 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6788086 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6788087 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
6788088 no desire is just a desire and no dream is just a dream

6788092 i studied film like i never studied before watching how other guys prepared for the season ronde barber jermaine phillips usually when youre playing you dont have time to notice stuff like that the biggest positive i took out of that was the mental aspect of the game watching film studying other players

6788094 i was waiting for this day and finally i see the russians leaving my home town im so happy
6788095 the distribution of food and hygiene kits went well that is just one day but its a step in the right direction
6788096 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6788097 i cannot go on like this any more i cry every day
6788098 in as much as you have done this to the least of these swindlers slumlords and dishonest developers defrauding the least of these my brethren you have done this unto me
6788099 as can be seen the house and the adjacent lot are landscaped as one property there appears to be a wall around both properties together enclosing the house and its side yard there appears to be no access from the street to the property rezko purchased except through the obamas driveway it is in other words the yard of the obamas house rather than merely purchasing a separate lot rezko appears to have purchased the yard of the obama manse and allowed them to live in the house yard property amounting to a gift or loan if you will of considerable value
6788100 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over

6788104 desapareci con su beb que habr a nacido el s bado
6788105 mi mam hizo la denuncia cuando se enter de que quer a entregar a su beb en adopci n y ya le hab an buscado un hotel para quedarse antes de dar a luz pero luego le perdimos el rastro y ahora est desaparecida ella y su beb que sabemos naci el martes pero nada m s
6788106 nosotros queremos a nuestro sobrino o sobrina pero no sabemos qu hacer ya porque la polic a nos dijo que es un caso cerrado porque ella es mayor
6788107 parece ser que viaj a buenos aires el s bado junto con los adoptantes la madre adoptiva le dejo los datos de donde estaba a la policia eso nos dijeron mi mama no tiene derecho a reclamar le dijeron nosotros estamos en la chacra y no podemos andar detr s de ella
6788108 no habl nunca con nosotros no le dio la cara no explic porque hizo lo que hizo nos enteramos que el beb naci porque la polic a nos cont porque ella nunca dijo nada ahora la polic a dijo que la citar en buenos aires para que venga a declarar y ah veremos que dice
6788109 las medidas ser n duras para aquellos que tengan perros infectados
6788110 en realidad desde el ejecutivo se viene trabajando en la prevenci n de la leishmaniasis pero nosotros desde el legislativo est bamos necesitando ordenar la cuesti n en cuanto a una legislaci n que sea m s
6788111 las cuestiones para propietarios de animales y en especial perros son duras hay que sacrificar al animal si o si y si se detecta canes abandonados en la v a p blica el ejecutivo debe retener al animal y sacrificarlo lamentablemente adem s la ordenanza establece determinadas multas para aquellos que no cumplan con estas cuestiones que tienen que ver con la prevenci n
6788112 no hace falta recorrer barrios espec ficamente para controlar esto porque uno sale a la calle y lo ve as que creo que no es necesario el proyecto fue aprobado casi por unanimidad uno de los temas que preguntamos al ejecutivo es la situaci n de la econom a para aumentar la cantidad de inspectores como hay pocos en la misma ordenanza pedimos que se aumente la cantidad de recurso humano y tambi n la movilidad porque sabemos bien lo que hace falta para controlar 400 000 habitantes y adem s hay personas que tienen m s de un solo perro y es importante recalcar que no tiene nada que ver con las clases sociales porque los casos se han dado en diferentes estratos de la sociedad
6788113 yo tengo un caso testigo que se dio en el centro c vico donde hab a animales que eran muy queridos por los empleados pero no eran de nadie y hubo que sacrificarlos esto es as y ante todo hay que preservar la vida humana
6788114 el d a mi rcoles la municipalidad lanz un programa espec fico para la lucha de esta enfermedad y que juntamente con salud p blica se va a trabajar en esa cuesti n a nosotros nos preocupa m s que en los meses de invierno no proliferan tanto sino que generalmente se dan en pocas de verano y tenemos que tomar medidas duras para que los casos no aumenten en esa estaci n y adem s hay que tener en cuenta que vivimos en una zona tropical y tenemos m nimamente seis o siete meses de verano y encima tuvimos poco invierno por lo cual va a ser dif cil ya que no ha matado los insectos infectocontagiosos entonces hay que poner mano dura en esta cuesti n y concientizar a la gente
6788115 me parece que una de las cuestiones fundamentales es que trabajemos todos y b sicamente me parece que los medios de prensa deben ser medios transmisores masivos que concientizan a la poblaci n porque parece que la gente no toma conciencia hasta que no les pase a ellos y en realidad yo he conocido casos en los que personas de clases altas han sufrido leishmaniasis y tambi n las clases medias o bajas entonces lo que tenemos que hacer es trabajar en la concientizaci n de la poblaci n sobre la prevenci n si tenemos que sacrificar nuestros animalitos a pesar de que los queremos mucho lo tenemos que hacer para preservar la vida de nuestros familiares vecinos y de la poblaci n en general esperemos que la prevenci n sea intensiva y que se inviertan muchos recursos en esta cuesti n porque tienen que ver con la vida humana
6788116 they made his sister and two little girls watch them as they executed the three men

6788121 when we were designing the latest version of docmetrics we asked our customers and prospects what features they would like to see added to our dynamic pdf forms technology

6788123 the latest additions to our software improve not only the way forms look but also the way they perform within adobe reader

6788128 what we see is a picture of total domination by the cablecos
6788129 we have to go back to the third quarter of 2003 to find a period where the telcos added more revenue generating units than the cablecos in canada
6788130 i believe life is constantly testing us for our level of commitment and lifes greatest rewards are reserved for those who demonstrate a never ending commitment to act until they achieve this level of resolve can move mountains but it must be constant and consistent as simplistic as this may sound it is still the common denominator separating those who live their dreams from those who live in regret
6788131 if you do what youve always done youll get what youve always gotten
6788132 for changes to be of any true value theyve got to be lasting and consistent
6788133 live life fully while youre here experience everything take care of yourself and your friends
6788134 the life i value is one that is connected to all things
6788135 there comes a time in each of our lives when we have the opportunity to reach out and turn the switch that will change darkness
6788136 if their discernment leads them to the conclusion that they cannot participate in such raids in good conscience we urge them not to do so if ice agents refuse to participate in immigration raids in conformity with their faith and conscience we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6788137 now when we get involved in that area the ability to practice their faith that becomes a concern for me right away tobin said
6788138 but keep in mind many of them are here because the system itself is broken weve gone two decades with this current immigration policy that has enabled and allowed this situation to develop
6788139 people who came here did not come here with the express purpose of breaking the law
6788140 i know for sure what jesus would not do he would not sweep into a community gather up large groups of people separate family members one from another and deport them to another country i know for sure he would not do that
6788141 the men and women of ice have sworn an oath to uphold the laws of our nation and it is a duty and responsibility we take seriously
6788142 while we have great respect for bishop tobin and his colleagues we believe their congregations and communities would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it
6788143 i think we need to work toward good laws but in the meantime treat people decently
6788144 great my wife just dragged me 12 hours into the middle of nowhere because she wants to buy an opal how did i let this happen

6788330 eighteen million democratic primary voters donated money volunteered their time and energy worked very hard and then not only supported senator clinton but voted for her and often recruited other supporters as well all the efforts of supporters of legitimate citizens were for nothing because this man lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process and the supporters of their citizen choice for the nomination voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by senator obamas lies and obfuscations he clearly shows a conscience of guilt by his actions in using the forged birth certificate and the lies hes told to cover his loss of citizenship we believe he does know supported this belief by his actions in hiding his secret in that he failed to regain his citizenship and used documents to further his position as a natural born citizen we would also show he proclaims himself a constitutional scholar and lecturer but did not learn he had no eligibility to become president except by means of lying obfuscations and deceptions his very acts proves he knew he was no longer a natural born citizen we believe he knew he was defrauding the country or else why use the forged birth certificate of his half sister americans lost money goods and services donated in their support of a candidate who supposedly was a natural born citizen simply because the dnc officers and party leaders looked the other way and did not demand credentials to answer the questions and prove whether or not senator obama was a legitimately natural born citizen even in light of recent information that has surfaced on websites on the internet suggesting senator obama may not be eligible to become president and questioning his status of multiple citizenships and questionable loyalties if the dnc officers and or leaders had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship through an oath of allegiance at age eighteen 18 as prescribed by constitutional laws the injunctive relief must be granted because failing to do so this inaction defrauds everyone who voted in the democratic primary for a nominee that is a fair representation of the voters failure to grant injunctive relief would allow a corrupted fraudulent nomination process to continue it not only allows but promotes an overwhelming degree of disrespect and creates such a lack of confidence in voters of the primary process itself so that it would cement a prevailing belief that no potential candidate has to obey the laws of this country respect our election process follow the constitution or even suffer any consequence for lying and defrauding voters to get onto the ballot when they have no chance of serving if they fraudulently manage to get elected it is unfair to the country for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of their ability to serve if elected all judges are lawyers and held to a higher standard of practice than a regular lawyer it is this judicial standard that demands injunctive relief prayed for here this relief is predicated upon one of the most basic premises of practicing law which states no lawyer can allow themselves to be used in furthering a criminal enterprise and by that gauge alone failing to give injunctive relief to the 18 million supporters of the other candidate a true natural born citizen eligible to serve if elected this court must not allow itself to be used to further the criminal and fraudulent acts to continue and be rewarded by becoming the democratic nominee failure to give the injunctive relief prayed for will insure that a corrupted presidential election process will only guarantee a show of unfair preference of one group of people over another group by not demanding the same rules be applied to all groups equally and fairly especially in light of the fact that both candidates are each considered a minority

6788395 i told somebody one time if they started a league called the backyard league where you threw a football into the backyard and you let guys choose up teams and make their own rules and play football the first two guys i would choose on my team are steve tasker and doug flutie
6788396 they know how to play the game probably because they are small they have been forced to figure out ways to be good they dont need somebody to tell them what to do they would figure it out they would be inventive creative and be two of the best players in that league and i think justin is a little like that all his life he has been forced to overachieve and make things work because he is not as tall as everyone else

6788433 neil armstrong signed very little and now hes stopped signing altogether
6788434 ive been known to do things no one else has done when collecting autographs
6788435 i take a lot of risks sometimes i lose a lot of money on those risks such as when i sent a box of valuable books and cash overnight to a contact in india for the dalai lama to sign i never saw the books or the money again
6788436 flatsigned is extremely proud of the fact that our collection has earned a special place in the hearts of the hollywood community many of which star in movies based on the lives and experiences of celebrities and authors we specialize in
6788437 i patterned my company after my only competitor easton press theyre in the business of publishing leather bound limited numbered editions i was very impressed with their quality and i sought out their binder
6788438 now our books are bound and printed by the same companies with moir patterned sheets a built in satin bookmark gilded page edges and gold stamping and raised hubs on the spines we go the extra step and add a photograph of the author signing our books on the inside and a dual hologram seal one on the signed page and one on the certificate of authenticity this way only one book can match each certificate it makes for a beautiful product
6788439 a lot of people have accused me of fakes because they dont think anyone in the world can have 50 000 rare autographed books i have never faked an autograph in my life
6788440 many of the groups members are great people and very professional booksellers
6788441 i buy books from many abaa members however it saddens me that the organizations leadership is so aggressively trying to maintain their monopoly on the rare book market that they would attempt to discredit honest people the time wasted in terrorizing me has allowed others who are guilty of faking autographed books to slip through the cracks and steal money from other honest people
6788442 it is true that people who have small dreams or simple minds simply cannot believe that a poor guy from the south can become a multi millionaire just by taking a few risks

6788455 slaan richting die goal hopelijk tikt iemand die bal er in dacht ik gelukkig tikte naomi van as hem bij de paal binnen het was zeker niet ingestudeerd
6788456 het was een heel zware wedstrijd maar je gaat maar door omdat je zo in de wedstrijd zit je denkt ook niet na over het resultaat het is de kunst om in zon finale gewoon je ding te doen
6788457 het hele toernooi is het iedere wedstrijd al goed gekomen
6788458 toen de eerste drie corners er niet in gingen dacht ik even het zal toch niet waar zijn maar die meiden in het veld bleven zo rustig dat ik me eigenlijk niet druk maakte
6788459 ze zagen er in de rust nog zo fit uit dat ik het vertrouwen ben blijven houden ik wist dat het doelpunt zou komen het team stelde de coach gerust
6788460 waar ik misschien nog wel het meest trots op ben is dat dit team zichzelf stuurt ze doen het voor zichzelf op ervaring op tactische kennis ook dan heeft china dat altijd naar de coach moet kijken om te weten hoe het moet spelen het toch een stuk moeilijker
6788461 we bleven gaan zeventig minuten lang ik moet onze inspanningsfysioloog jos geijsel mijn complimenten maken die heeft deze ploeg topfit gemaakt
6788462 ook onze mentale coach rico schuijers heeft een belangrijke rol gespeeld in hun hoofd waren deze meiden zo ongelofelijk sterk dat is hetzelfde duo dat ook bij de waterpolovrouwen op de achtergrond heeft gewerkt dat kan geen toeval zijn
6788463 het is zon onbeschrijfelijk gevoel fantastisch echt niet normaal ik mag na de huldiging gelukkig eerst even lekker naar de dopingcontrole maar daarna ga ik helemaal los reken daar maar op
6788464 dit was een loodzware wedstrijd maar dat zal ons er niet van weerhouden tot morgenochtend vroeg feest te vieren
6788465 het is geweldig om voor zoveel nederlands publiek op de tribunes te spelen en dan ook nog eens een olympische finale winnen
6788466 china speelde vanavond een fantastische wedstrijd deze ploeg heeft het ons heel moeilijk gemaakt in de laatste twintig minuten komen we twee keer tot scoren maar china kreeg ook nog een aantal kansen
6788467 haar totale aantal treffers was van ondergeschikt belang aan het winnen van olympisch goud klonk het ten overvloede
6788468 het is leuk voor de statistieken maar er is maar n ding dat telt en dat is deze gouden medaille
6788469 george and his team continue to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders
6788470 we are pleased to see the industry recognize the great talent and skill that george displays
6788471 we are very pleased that barrons and value line saw fit to rank our fund in their top 100
6788472 what is perhaps most gratifying is that unlike most rankings based solely on performance the barrons methodology took volatility into full account
6788473 our teams conservative nature has complemented a disciplined stock picking process proving especially helpful during recent months of market turmoil we look forward to extending our successful track record in the months and years ahead

6788483 putem spera in acest an sa doboram recordul psihologic de zece miliarde de euro in conditiile in care dupa primele sase luni valoarea investitiilor straine directe a fost de 4 8 miliarde de euro iar seriile anuale de date ne arata ca in a doua jumatate a anului valoarea lor creste
6788484 conform datelor furnizate de bnr valoarea investitiilor straine directe in primul semestru al anului in curs este de 4 75 miliarde de euro aceasta evolutie pozitiva a fluxului investitional a stat la baza revizuirii estimarilor agentiei romane pentru investitii straine aris pentru anul in curs tinand cont de cifrele oficiale pentru perioada ianuarie iunie 2008 preconizam ca pana la finele acestui an valoarea investitiilor straine directe va depasi opt miliarde de euro

6788495 we are pleased that proseco has chosen us for the video surveillance of the holland heineken house in beijing this is a great opportunity to demonstrate the many advantages of our high resolution image quality in the spotlight of course mobotix already has previous experience with large sports events such as the video surveillance of the fritz walter stadium in kaiserslautern during the soccer world cup 2006 event
6788496 after exhaustive testing we found out that the mobotix cameras fulfill our requirements and wishes in the best way the decisive criteria were the high image quality the integrated sensors and the extensive range of functions of the cameras depending on the situation it is important for us to record permanently or event controlled based on movement infrared signal or certain noise or light conditions all this is possible with mobotix cameras without using external additional devices or expensive accessories moreover the cameras are extremely robust of high quality and maintenance free
6788497 by charter the only people that actually can pass taxes would be metro council

6788506 like most second year law students on the harvard law review senator obama wrote an unsigned student case comment that summarized a recent decision by a state or lower federal court the piece analyzed a case in which a mother was sued by her child for injuries caused by the mothers negligent driving during her pregnancy senator obama concluded that in such cases the illinois supreme court was correct not to allow lawsuits by children against their mothers
6788507 he wrote that the best way to protect the health of fetuses was to provide prenatal education and health care to pregnant women issues he remains committed to today and which he has worked to advance as a legislator and in this campaign
6788508 i could not believe that i was out and when i heard last night i was in the final it was my time

6788510 there are a lot of parallels between the principals of scuba diving and how to live a rich and fulfilling life
6788511 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6788512 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6788513 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6788514 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6788515 que no te voy a ensenyar el pasaporte lo que quieres saber es si tengo visado y no no lo tengo
6788516 but now i feel like i am putting my money where my mouth is i had this epiphany while waiting for barack to give his speech in south carolina i was standing next to some statue you know one of those really southern statues and here we were in this room black and white and up come bill clintons comments about jesse jackson on the big tv
6788517 i was standing with some students and they started chanting race doesnt matter
6788518 and of course race matters i just felt so excited with the possibility of electing a man obama with such compassion and intellect
6788519 most of what i know about writing ive learned through running every day i know if i hadnt become a long distance runner when i became a novelist my work would have been vastly different how different hard to say but something would have been different

6788524 it would be very surprising if the way of establishing that delight satisfaction and other reactions were aesthetic turned out to be quite different from the way in which we establish them to be moral personal economic intellectual etc it would be logically disturbing to find that one had suddenly to depart from a single fundamentum divisionis which had suffered for all the other types when one came to the aesthetic
6788525 apart from these more logical points it is surely clear that when we experience emotions that we should wish to call aesthetic they are often very different from each other

6788534 espero ser una m s de las que vivi en este seleccionado nunca me caracteric por ser la mejor del equipo lo m o siempre fue todo garra y esfuerzo tal vez las defensores somos las menos habilidosas pero creo que todas de alguna forma le brindaron al equipo lo mejor

6788539 it showed a great level of sexism and when you saw the great hope and then the sexism and the misogyny in our culture it was really upsetting to many people
6788540 that is precisely why im voting for john mccain well behaved women rarely make history i want to send a message to the democratic party from women when you disrespect us when you deny an overqualified candidate there will be repercussions

6788547 we did not see it coming at all maybe we were na ve but nobody could imagine that the russians who liberated us from national socialism in 1945 would conceive of ending this minor attempt at freedom dub ek was taken by surprise as well

6788566 the japanese were looking for rosas father because his cousins were members of the hukbalahap and their family was suspected to be collaborators
6788567 run my child run the japanese took their guns and fired to everyone around killing those on their way the people ran for their lives hiding in the holes they made in case of attacks rosa ran along with other children she climbed on a hill and saw a huge rock with a foxhole under it two kids were already hidden inside

6788569 many people were killed that day and most of them were children rosa survived that days slaughter however the violence she saw changed her from a refine girl into a brave fighter she grew up to join the hukbalahap along with her brothers rosa was a young woman and her brothers prohibited her from fighting with arms instead she became an informer and a deliverer of supply for the troop she fought for freedom for several years until the day when the american army took the philippines from the violent hands of the japanese and gave her freedom rosas brothers however did not live to taste that freedom they were killed during one of their battles rosa and her father lived quietly in their farm they had no one but each other but one night rosa was awakened by the wail of their carabao she hurried down the hut and saw her father lying on its back bleeding he was badly beaten and his face was unrecognizable with all might left he had managed to say the names of his assassins before he let go gardo alfredo and ronnie you will pay for this i swear rosa said weeping

6788571 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
6788572 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules

6788576 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
6788577 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
6788578 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
6788579 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
6788580 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body
6788581 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies

6788587 there is so much mixed information out there particularly as different districts within even a single county have different recycling policies we need clarity of information to stop the confusion and allow people to have a go

6788594 you can see a lot of difference in the students faces
6788595 the students are good here without help but we see that our government cares about us its been a month and a half since they came to our school and asked what we needed and since then we have seen good progress
6788596 when the taliban was in power it was illegal for girls to go to school but we never forgot how important it is to educate all afghan children
6788597 this school used to be housing for russian pilots but the government of afghanistan helped us make it usable as a place of education
6788598 a lot of families cant even afford to buy paper or a pen for their children
6788599 we dont have a lot of money but i see a bright future for schools in this area what matters most is the students are interested in studying and learning and the people here see the value in education
6788600 farmers there terrace the land to make it arable they draw water by placing irrigation canals far upstream to the river the southern districts have wider valleys and are definitely the bread basket of konar there is plenty of water in the konar river the problem is moving the water from the river to the crops
6788601 our program focuses on improving yields through training so surplus harvests can be sold at markets that would increase farm revenues for future corps and benefit other agriculture economic initiatives
6788602 our people are happy that the prt helps us and we are ready to assist and support the construction companies which will undertake the projects
6788603 our deepest sympathies go out to these soldiers family friends and fellow soldiers
6788604 the focus right now is to look after their families and colleagues and to provide them the best possible support during this difficult time
6788605 i offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those killed by the blast
6788606 isaf remains committed to rebuilding afghanistan a cause for which these soldiers gave their life
6788607 when my blindfold was finally removed i found myself inside a newly painted room roughly four by five meters with barred windows the outside of which was boarded with plywood panels
6788608 i was stripped naked my wedding ring watch eyeglasses shoes clothes were all taken away later a guard who was in civilian clothes brought in a bedpan and told me that i would be allowed to go to the bathroom once a day in the morning to shower brush my teeth and wash my clothes two shirts and underwear the intention was to make us really feel helpless and dependent for everything on the guards
6788609 i remembered your famous words hindi natutulog ang diyos but i felt at that moment he was having a very good sound siesta and i was afraid when he finally woke up i would have been gone
6788610 a god man who preached nothing but love and was rewarded with death who had power over all creation but took the mockery of a crown of thorns with humility and patience and for all his noble intentions he was shamed vilified slandered and betrayed
6788611 then as if i heard a voice tell me why do you cry
6788612 with this realization i went down on my knees and begged his forgiveness i know i was merely undergoing a test maybe in preparation for another mission i know everything that happens in this world is with his knowledge and consent i knew he would not burden me with a load i could not carry i therefore resigned myself to his will

6788622 as were trying to get tony pike reps and grutza reps and demetrius jones reps who needs a lot its a matter of not having enough footballs its not like hes done anything wrong we have to decide who the guys are weve focused most of our attention on grutza and pike
6788623 what we decided is that we wanted more of a veteran operation with two guys who have four and five years of experience the spring is a great opportunity to get those young guys work anyway and he did very well we can win with chazz anderson its just a numbers game right now

6788645 we thought hellgate would have been slightly higher quality than it turned out to be
6788646 were certainly sad with the results for flagship and whats happened with hellgate because at the time we signed it we were trying to get involved in a very complicated relationship between namco and flagship we were coming late to the party and trying to do whatever we could to sprinkle the game magic on the project and get it headed in the right direction i think thats an example where all three parties had the best interest of the game in mind and sometimes the game doesnt work out hellgate is still an incredible concept

6788707 its a common misconception that big firms with extensive human and financial resources can do a better job of educating and motivating their workers to make quality improvements the truth is that smaller companies can be even more successful at soliciting employee support and involvement because there are fewer management layers to permeate and fewer people to convince of the benefits

6788716 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
6788717 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
6788718 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
6788719 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
6788720 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
6788721 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
6788722 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
6788723 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
6788724 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
6788725 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
6788726 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild

6788733 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
6788734 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
6788735 at the time of the alleged decision in 2003 to concoct the false letter the vice presidents office had been reportedly pressuring the cia to prove this connection as a justification to invade iraq
6788736 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6788737 the law specifically provides that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
6788738 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
6788739 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
6788740 i asked chairman conyers to investigate these claims because if true the administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war
6788741 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
6788742 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
6788743 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
6788744 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
6788745 my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
6788746 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
6788747 i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found
6788748 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr suskind in his book i do speak to discussions regarding using habbush which were frequent during that period but what i was talking about was the possibility of using him to tamp down the insurgency not to influence western public opinion
6788749 the fabrication of a letter as claimed by mr suskind would have been much more than a non event
6788750 an order such as the one outlined by mr suskind would have been a huge event and in my opinion illegal an order to fabricate such a document would have been rejected out of hand and it is improbable to believe anyone would write such a request
6788751 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
6788752 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda
6788753 richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
6788754 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
6788755 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
6788756 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
6788757 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community

6788768 even though previous treo pro images and specifications were helpful and more than a little bit exciting it certainly makes an even greater impression to have the treo pro physically in my hands to say its

6788775 he said you should have thought about that before you came out this morning it was like a dagger in my heart that a police officer of my city would come up with anything like that
6788776 its always enjoyable to come to a new venue and im impressed
6788777 it was pretty hot out there but the track is good fun and the layout is interesting i like street circuits because i raced on so many of them during my time racing champ car in america but apart from the harbour and the buildings this doesnt really look like a street circuit because it has long straights we had a good day the first practice was a bit difficult and the track was very dusty but we expected that the afternoon was much better and the car got more and more into the set up window i hope we can keep going in this direction because it has been a productive day
6788778 that was not a particularly good day for me we need to adjust the car balance so we will have to look into it tonight the track is good though and i like it in karting we used to race on a lot of street circuits so learning it doesnt take long but you need to find a compromise on set up because there is a mix of slow corners and higher speed sections with long straights the most important thing is how much the surface will change during the weekend the asphalt is quite smooth and while it was predictably slippery today the grip should improve so it will be hard to get the set up right
6788779 the most important thing when you go to a new track is to make it through your programme without any technical problems which was the case today on the first day at a new track we amend our usual plan today we carried out more long runs both at the start of p1 to learn the circuit and at the end of p2 to help judge the tyre behaviour because we have no reference here apart from that you aim to find the balance and the right downforce levels there doesnt seem to be a lot of grip around and it didnt improve as massively as we would have expected still were quite happy with where we are with timo but jarno is struggling a bit with an inconsistent balance so we will have to look into that and fix it for tomorrow
6788780 my new haircut makes me look like such a retard
6788781 at least you get to choose yours im stuck with mine
6788782 i would say the federal government has the same view on this as we do
6788783 we want to do a stunning job of staging great ceremonies at bc place in 2010 we need to represent the interests of the country in the most beautiful poignant and emotional way
6788784 we want to tell a great story and thats who we are and i think thats what they expect of us
6788785 these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
6788786 they have many people involved with us in many ways and theyre working hard with us to make sure we do the very best with the resources we have
6788787 were working very well together and i just think the federal government like any other partner we have wants to make sure we perform at a very high level
6788788 whos the government the government is the cabinet the government is the ruling political party which is the conservative party its not the priorities of canadian people

6788790 he went into the pond hoping to be blessed when a crocodile attacked him and dragged him into the deep part of the pond kabir told the australian associated press
6788791 this is a very unusual incident normally the crocodiles are very friendly and do not harm people
6788792 there are definitely more accidents out there that we havent even heard about yet
6788793 since we dont have a motive we just cant look in one direction for a certain person
6788794 heres the only way its going to help us probably if someone just bought a gun or they loaned it to someone recently right before the homicides and got it back
6788795 we just want people to cooperate so we can find this weapon and then the person who had it in his hand
6788796 one of our bus routes used to go by the crime scene and we rerouted the bus even though it takes a little longer and a little more fuel
6788797 thats exactly what the multiple witnesses told us we asked them to get more specific of course and thats the best they could do
6788798 automatically people are assuming that this indian did something wrong just because he was in the vicinity
6788799 he was just seen in the area close to the time the girls were shot and killed
6788800 that is such a remote area that that stood out to us
6788801 this is unusual but we have many cases where its a whodunit that we have to go to the public to ask for help
6788802 it will be a very big production visceral and intellectual
6788803 his brilliance will percolate into the action his intellect was as much of a curse as it was a blessing he was a deeply layered character
6788804 they dont even have a script yet we are way ahead
6788805 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6788806 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6788807 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal

6788813 yeah well sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand
6788814 if youve never read farber just stop here and get to it his collected criticism in a volume called negative space is one of the touchstone texts of film writing tough minded sharp eyed idiosyncratic often wildly funny and with a bedrock integrity and aesthetic acuity that even best of contemporary film critics are hard pressed to approach let alone match he is most often cited for coining the phrases termite art and white elephant art two opposed categories what i found and find most valuable in his criticism is his ability to apprehend the entirety of a film he got it from every angle he could appreciate a b war picture in the same sense that the guy on the street could while fully comprehending its value as a work of modern contemporary art im away from my study so i cant grab a copy of space to quote from it willy nilly but i can say this i doubt that farber was particularly surprised by godards breathless because his criticism actively anticipated that film
6788815 manny could seem inscrutable yet was actually hyperprecise which is why we kept listening unpacking his phrases sure that whatever came out no matter how gnomic contained multitudes
6788816 jonathan rosenbaum has an update of a 1993 essay on his eponymous blog

6788818 fifty bucks do you know how many years willy poster and i worked on that sturges piece
6788819 from what i know about welles and the history of the film francos version is not even an approximation never mind a reconstruction theres no story here simply a random succession of events and images and a whole lot of narrative detours but even as a visual record of welles raw footage its a travesty its a given that much of the existing rough cut footage is in rough condition showing the signs of wear and tear from years of tinkering on moviolas and dragging the reels from country to country but franco and company have if anything compounded the problems with hazy blurry copies of the master footage and video noise introduced as a result of the projects most egregious crimes against welles the video manipulation of footage to layer images one on another

6788822 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6788823 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6788824 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6788825 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6788826 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6788827 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6788828 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation
6788829 like a lot of teachers there now i figured how bad could it be i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005
6788830 i became very very sick my immune system shut down i collapsed and was bedridden for several months
6788831 i wouldnt have kids in the school if i didnt think it was safe i would close the school
6788832 i do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous
6788833 you can go most anyplace and build a school on top of a superfund site
6788834 they can build a school anywhere they want really and thats the sad truth i think at schools very little has changed and thats unfortunate
6788835 the children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them
6788836 so for example one of these things was phosphorous rocks phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface the children would pick up these phosphorous rocks and when you threw them at a hard surface they would explode like a firecracker
6788837 i have a high school education i dont have a science degree but you dont have to be a scientist to know that 20 000 tons of chemicals and kindergartners dont mix
6788838 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6788839 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6788840 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet under water
6788841 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6788842 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6788843 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6788844 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6788845 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6788846 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6788847 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6788848 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6788849 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6788850 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6788851 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6788852 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6788853 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6788854 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
6788855 its one of the things that really bothers me i couldnt imagine an order for eviction that didnt set out where and how the respondents would be accommodated
6788856 as a society i believe we need to become more active and stay healthy
6788857 its an added expense and doesnt fit with the districts mandate i suggest turning it over to the city
6788858 no instance in which the board can make policy that the commission cannot override
6788859 gamesindustry biz is one of my starting tabs when i boot up so its always one of the first sites i see each day its good being able to catch up with whats happened in the us overnight and in the uk before im awake first thing and know that the stories will be accurate and thought out
6788860 were not as quick as wed like to be and weve still got a bit of work to do
6788861 the first session was very testing but we improved the car in the second and weve got a lot of data to go through tonight to get ourselves a good grid position tomorrow
6788862 this morning wasnt so good but we worked on the set up and made some improvements for the afternoon
6788863 theyve done a great job with the track and its a fantastic facility to drive so thats good
6788864 its a typical street circuit in that the rubbered line builds up very quickly but then off line you have much less grip
6788865 we are deeply concerned about the violence disruption and the safety of our employees equipment and investments at the project site
6788866 obviously it is not a conducive atmosphere the compound wall has been broken down materials stolen we cannot operate a plant with police protection if this happens even before we start production then what would happen later
6788867 it is for the people of west bengal and calcutta to decide whether we are unwanted or to accept us as a good corporate citizen if we are unwanted here then we would have to make a move
6788868 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation demands so
6788869 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
6788870 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
6788871 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states

6788884 twilight caught my interest so much i couldnt stand to put it down once i started i read this book in one sitting and didnt finish until 5 00 am but it was worth every minute its the love story between a vampire and a human and the love feels so real its hard to imagine its just a book the main character bella swan is instantly likeable and its impossible not to empathize with the new couple as their relationship starts to bud the vampire edward cullen is captivating with his extraordinary beauty ancient genteelness and ability to read minds but just when the tension eases and it seems like things are going to work out for them and thats a hard thing to come by considering their separate diets disaster strikes the book was so much more than i expected the love feels so real and at its heart its more a love story between two beings than anything else of course because one of them is a vampire theres a bit of hunting and quite a lot of action as well this was a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable booki recommend it completely
6788885 wow i must admit that when i heard about twilight by stephanie meyer i was very intrigued a book about a regular teenage girl just like you and me falling in love with a gorgeous vampire who wouldnt want to read it i was hooked from the first page and as i read it it only got better twilight is great because it seems so ordinary is it possible for this situation to happen in your life imagine seeing a guy more handsome than any youve ever seen and not being able to tear you eyes away from him imagine that the force of your mutual chemistry feels like electricity i promise you that every girl will want to be isabella swan throw in a little danger a sticky situation and a love more powerful than either character has ever known and what do you get stephenie meyers twilight it is definitely a book worth reading
6788886 i just need to find out what happens next just one more chapter before bed i swear
6788887 i cant wait to start that steven king novel just finish this thing and get it over with

6788979 when it gets a little boring i might pull it out
6788980 im not someone whos anti technology but im always worried that technology becomes an end in and of itself and it replaces teaching or it replaces analysis
6788981 we think this is the way the future is going to work
6788982 you got a hundred dollar bill throw your hands up
6788983 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6788984 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months
6788985 were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6788986 29 1 of homeowners who purchased in the past five years are currently underwater on their mortgages i e owe more on the mortgage than the house is worth we also reported that almost half 45 of those that bought at the national market peak of 2006 currently have negative equity
6788987 i disappoint people who meet me in person because i dont look like me
6788988 but the public is really hard on people in the industry and your image has to be perfect and i openly admit that i have cellulite and i get that touched off
6788989 its not immoral to retouch people and everyone does it
6788990 the difficulty is when you mess with the truth when its distorted and done to the point where you can see it and the person doesnt look real
6788991 in an effort to make a cover that would pop on the newsstand we combined two different shots of julia roberts we acknowledge that we may have gone too far and hope that ms roberts will accept our apology
6788992 its a shame they didnt use the body that went with the head because it was a great giorgio armani pantsuit that she wore to the peoples choice awards
6788993 if youre going to do it then at least match her head up to her body and make the neck look like it belongs to her i still cant figure out which exact picture the face came from
6788994 the only things that were altered in the cover photo were the color of her shirt and the length of her hair very slightly in order to reflect her current length
6788995 i was pretty proud of how my legs actually looked in the real picture
6788996 i have polaroids from the shoot and i thought i looked fine
6788997 people in the legal world are now concerned about whether photos can be accepted as evidence anymore especially when you can alter the scene as you click the shutter
6788998 and in the old days there was an original now there is no original photography as a tool for providing evidence or as proof may not exist anymore
6788999 postman would ask what problem does this new technology answer what problem is this solving whats the point the problem is obviously that people want to look thinner
6789000 we had a personal trainer wanting to use the camera as a motivational tactic for her clients
6789001 putting a good photo of the person on their refrigerator so they can say i do want to look like this as opposed to the fat picture in a bathing suit
6789002 the consumer products and all these changes in photography to me are going to cause an undermining of peoples ability to believe a photograph which is the foundation of photojournalism
6789003 now that it is at the consumer level and people are going to see this i am not sure on a fundamental level that they are ever going to believe a photo when they see it
6789004 it almost does contribute to people changing their identities for whatever reasons they are motivated to do that
6789005 particularly i can see it being used on a dating service now you can say the picture is current and still lie but what i want to know is whats going to finally happen when you meet that person even if you are not using it for that its only interest is to make you look better but why would you take a picture of yourself and give it to people who know you if it doesnt really look like you
6789006 the retail environment is extremely difficult and the primary root of pacific sunwears poor performance

6789027 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6789028 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6789029 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6789030 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise

6789034 art director by day crafter by night from the earliest days i can remember i have had a love for crafts even as a child i was drawn to creating and decorating items created from things found in everyday life scraps of fabric interesting paper string buttons trim containers of various sort and such this love for creating things transformed itself in an art school education and later employment as a textile designer for kidswear my work even in school has always had a whimsical quality more fun and carefree i have found i enjoy creating things that are fanciful and warm from a variety of items that are cleverly composed to interest the eye over the years i continued to work as a commercial artist by day in my spare time i created prints collages and decoupaged items i gave away many of these items as gifts for family and friends over time i was approached to create handmade items for the life events of those around me baby gifts wedding presents and items for special birthdays and anniversaries to provide the supplies i needed for these projects i scoured antique sales flea markets and online shopping to find interesting textiles trim and ephemera i could use for my various projects and to display around my home i first created a cake topper as a birthday gift for a friend later i made one as a wedding present the gifts were so well received that it inspired me to consider making toppers for sale and on commission from there the work has evolved into creating more and different types of toppers from the various trims textiles and paper items i have collected over the years each topper is a completely unique creation based on the materials i have at hand those i collect at the time of the project the color palette specified and the various needs of my clientele many of the items on the toppers are antique or vintage materials i use archival quality glues and paints whenever possible to insure the topper stays fresh and bright over time many of my clients display their toppers under a glass covering such as a bell jar this helps to further preserve the toppers and showcases their craftsmanship and charm some of the toppers rest on decorated boxes suitable for storing small keepsakes from weddings and other life events however above all the toppers are meant to be a creative reminder of special times that provides a spark of whimsy to those who own them

6789037 we thought hellgate would have been slightly higher quality than it turned out to be
6789038 were certainly sad with the results for flagship and whats happened with hellgate because at the time we signed it we were trying to get involved in a very complicated relationship between namco and flagship we were coming late to the party and trying to do whatever we could to sprinkle the game magic on the project and get it headed in the right direction i think thats an example where all three parties had the best interest of the game in mind and sometimes the game doesnt work out hellgate is still an incredible concept
6789039 we were co publishing with namco im not going to dodge a bullet we had people who were actively working with them on the title we thought it would have been slightly higher quality than it turned out to be and i think the problem with the game was that by the time it got really good we were four to six months post release that was too late wed lost the fanbase it was strictly an issue of the gameplay and game quality needing to be higher at the start unfortunately flagship was in a situation where they werent in a position to hold the game any longer and the situation kind of took over

6789055 i would think eddie alvarez is the no 1 contender
6789056 hes definitely ranked higher than nick diaz kj already beat nick diaz
6789057 eddie alvarez is getting married but thats not our problem
6789058 are you fucking kjs career up like you fucked brandon veras up
6789059 she tells a different story and i no longer know which one is right
6789060 in my mind she picked it up when she was shooting
6789061 and she came back and said i really like it can i help get it made
6789062 she says i asked her to read it on the jacket and i asked her for notes but given i actually hate people reading my work i cannot bear it i cant believe that one but i am a fantasist and quite possibly thats accurate
6789063 whatever happened she ran with it and she then got asked if she was going to be in it by the people she was talking to she went um yeah
6789064 it was a kind of a revenge really theres got to be fun somewhere
6789065 mostly to her because she didnt believe she could sing but she can and i always knew she could
6789066 you have to woo john it took us a long time finally keira got him on the phone and said will you direct this
6789067 we dont know the truth of it it is a fiction
6789068 you have to take liberties and rebekah and i were very clear about the fact that would have to happen there was a week when i sent her away and said youve really got to think about this
6789069 if you go away for a week and come back and say ive got carte blanche then ill do it but if you cant say that and i totally understand it if you cant then we just forget it
6789070 but the thing was i really liked all four characters so i didnt feel that i was going to be contemptuous i think thats the worst thing that you can do to someone living or dead is to scorn them
6789071 i acted for 12 years and gave it up sohappily i loved it to begin with andthen i hated it and i stopped
6789072 it was stage fright i absolutely adored the people and i still miss that but the actual performance which is anecessary part you couldnt drag meup
6789073 that there is an even better known example in the
6789074 any customer with a complaint should see myself as soon as possible
6789075 i bought a porsche for myself as a little present
6789076 no one except for you yourself thought to send an apology
6789077 what comes first is a sense of wanting to grab something before it is lost forever
6789078 archetypes become a background a subtle vocabulary at the back of your mind
6789079 since the minute i decided to get some paints together ive been painting landscape but the work became more than that there is a certain amount of menace about them i like to think
6789080 and my mother was a housewife who played the piano
6789081 he would offer advice it was very helpful he was a superb painter my hero at the time
6789082 he sent me three page letters telling me what to think what i should be looking at he was a seminal figure in the way i evolved
6789083 after that i went to london and stayed for 10 years
6789084 i had good mates there brett whitely charlie blackman arthur boyd and i exhibited together at bond street galleries we used to see a lot of one another
6789085 the paintings just came out of nowhere it was an image that was very central about being whole again that was before id read about mandalas in jung
6789086 a sapphire miner called joe shannahan who became a jungian archetypal figure to me
6789087 he and a mate were writing their memoirs and their stories were just extraordinary in one he comes back to his house in a horse and dray to find it has been destroyed by fire in jungian terms thats a major image of transformation
6789088 i saw a lot of him we used to play chess drink a lot shoot the breeze he was one of the greatest painters australia has ever seen he died about three years later
6789089 they were large paintings with figures running from the light into the dark herding together as they went like lemmings
6789090 brett whitely would come up here and work non stop
6789091 he got me focused on the mountains and to this day they are still central in quite a few of my paintings
6789092 i did a series called cain and the promised land there was a lot of turmoil in the middle east at the time so i did these collages of thousands of figures brothers killing brothers on a global scale
6789093 but i spoke with steve a lot about these famous attacks and its because of him that i know so much about them
6789094 now this series is a matter of taking another look at these stories but mostly getting across the conservation message that they have
6789095 i never realised the wealth of heritage collections there is in brisbane
6789096 there will be an opportunity for people to write their memories down in a book at the exhibition so that the heritage will continue to live on
6789097 i really dont want to be lecturing people about the environment
6789098 but its about getting people to think a bit more about it
6789099 theres about 100 or 130 water bottles in each one of the chandeliers
6789100 i utilised fishing line as the main component to join all the bottles because its something thats an issue in our waterways as well
6789101 i sliced some of the bottles horizontally to get rings and when its all lit up they look like bubbles
6789102 visual arts are an amazing vehicle for education because they get people to communicate on a whole new level
6789103 the general public may not pay attention to statistical information but when its presented in a visual format they start questioning things
6789104 700 bottles are fished out of the river each week
6789105 its a very graphic but beautiful depiction of river pollution
6789106 heavily armed islamists have taken control of kismayu and the situation is now calm
6789107 i cannot see the militiamen and some people say they have escaped the islamists are now addressing the people and the shooting has stopped
6789108 we are also running short of drugs and more people are on the way to the hospital
6789109 this years class adds representatives from armenia and zambia two countries not previously represented in the program

6789113 mi numero telefonico 5555920316 una vez que termine de ordenar mis cosas decid probar marcar desde mi celular y en efecto entro mi llamada
6789114 ik schrijf verhalen wat er vervolgens aan themas in te vinden is maakt deel uit van de creativiteit van de lezer ik denk dat je onbewust dingen in een boek stopt die waar kunnen zijn bij nader inzien heb je het dan zelf bedacht bij een lezing gebeurt het mij wel eens dat iemand een opmerking maakt waarover ik dan stamel vanaf dit moment heb ik het altijd zo bedoeld
6789115 een tweeluik dat vind ik erg leuk want dat is nooit bij mij opgekomen waarover dan
6789116 kathys dochter gaat daar inderdaad over het is bedoeld als autobiografische roman de hoofdpersoon heet niet voor niets tim krabb maar emile binenbaum probeert marte jacobs toch niet terug te krijgen
6789117 zijn interpretatie dat zij van hem was en altijd is geweest blijkt correct maar wilde hij haar echt terug we weten niet zo veel over hem hij zal ook wel kinderen hebben ik heb versies van het boek waarin huwelijken en kinderen genoemd worden maar die heb ik er allemaal weer uit gehaald het enige bestaansrecht van emile is dat hij iets met marte heeft daarom heb ik hem gemaakt
6789118 emile binenbaum is een beetje zielige en mislukte dichter dat is ook zijn eigen inzicht aan het slot hij heeft ooit n goed gedicht geschreven dankzij zijn liefde voor marte jacobs maar eigenlijk had hij geen talent
6789119 ik zal op alle twee wel een beetje lijken maar ik ben geen van beiden
6789120 het verschil tussen reiff en binenbaum zie je goed als ze het over schrijven hebben emile heeft het idee dat het gedicht al bestaat dat hij het alleen maar hoeft te vinden en afstoffen als dat hem is gelukt dan is het van hem en dan gelooft hij erin dan heeft hij het gevoel dat hij heeft getoverd bij reiff is het precies omgekeerd hij zegt dat hij het gevoel van toveren zou hebben als hij n et geloofde wat hij schreef
6789121 soms ik heb dat proberen te beschrijven in het gouden ei de beste metafoor voor dat gevoel is het componeren van een schaakprobleem dat heeft geen maatschappelijke relevantie amper een publiek en er staat geen financi le vergoeding tegenover toch kun je gegrepen worden door een abstract idee dat je per se wilt uitbeelden ik ben daar echt verslaafd aan geweest heb er ook over geschreven in de man die de babson task wilde maken die botte maakdrang bevangt je soms ook bij het schrijven van romans die wel maatschappelijke relevantie hebben in de zin dat je er wat geld mee zult verdienen dat er lezers zijn het heeft ook te maken met mijn liefde voor compositie voor een schaakprobleem gelden allerlei concrete eisen als een idee kan worden uitgedrukt in drie zetten dan moet je het niet in vier doen en als het met twaalf stukken kan dan moet je het niet met zestien doen je ziet soms een knoedel stukken staan dat lever je zo toch niet in diemoet je toch afstoffen
6789122 ik doe wat er volgens mij in de literatuur gedaan moet worden een goed verhaal verzinnen en dat zo goed mogelijk vertellen dat is alles en als je dat doet en er schuilt een zekere diepte in je dan komt die diepte vanzelf wel in de tekst terecht
6789123 in goede literatuur kun je vaak themas aanwijzen waarvan je zeker weet dat de schrijver ze er niet bewust in heeft gestopt de avonden gaat over de bezoedeling van de zuiverheid maar dat wist van het reve niet toen hij het schreef als schrijvers hun themas gaan begrijpen gaan ze slechte boeken schrijven dat zie je in het latere werk van hermans dan is hij niet meer met verhalen bezig maar met themas zijn personages worden themakoelies dat is het ergste wat een schrijver kan overkomen je ziet dat vaak bij goede schrijvers die dan later literatuur gaan bedrijven en dan gaat het mis
6789124 ik had wel heel erg blind moeten zijn om dat niet te zien ik had het thema hereniging in de dood al een paar keer in mijn boeken ontdekt en dan gebeurt het mijzelf dat maakte enorme indruk op mij een belangrijk element van dat verhaal is dat het echt is gebeurd daarom heb ik ook besloten de hoofdpersoon tim krabb te noemen het is ook waar dat zoals in het boek staat ik als 19 jarige een manuscript over die liefde heb geschreven dat heb voor de roman gebruikt ik zou ook niet in staat zijn denk ik om het schrijven van een jongen van 19 aannemelijk in een boek te zetten
6789125 nu ja misschien wel wat er nu in het boek staat is een hervertelling het manuscript zelf zou ik niet durven tonen al is de opening van het boek er letterlijk uit afkomstig toen die verhouding was ge indigd dacht ik nu heb ik een onderwerp en ik heb meteen nadat ik haar de laatste keer had thuisgebracht de eerste bladzijden geschreven mijn eerste poging tot een roman ik heb het aan uitgevers opgestuurd en kreeg de bekende afwijzingsbriefjes met een tweede roman gebeurde hetzelfde kitty duisenberg was de derde
6789126 we hebben het wel gehad over een heruitgave van mijn eerste drie romans dus ook flanagan en red desert penitentiary misschien doen we dat nog wel eens maar ik ben nu een andere schrijver je zou heel erg duidelijk moeten maken wat het is een jeugdwerk van een schrijver die nu bekend is maar die toen niet op hetzelfde niveau schreef ik weet niet of ik als ik uitgever was kitty nu zou uitgeven ik weet niet of dat goed zou zijn voor die jongen misschien zou ik zeggen ga nog even door je moet niet haastig zijn maar ik las laatst een interview met mezelf dat werd gemaakt bij de presentatie van kitty duisenberg daarin zei ik veel dingen waar ik het nog steeds mee eens ben dingen die te maken hebben met mijn afkeer van experimentele literatuur en voorliefde voor begrijpelijkheid en mijn voorliefde voor constructie
6789127 ja u heeft gelijk maar u ziet ik ben niet bezig met zon overeenkomst ik ben daar ook wel bang voor nee bang is niet het goede woord ik ben er gespitst op dat themas niet al te zeer terugkomen maar misschien is dat bij marte jacobs toch weer gebeurd
6789128 dat zal vast wel zo zijn maar dat is ook weer een abstract idee waar ik niet veel aan heb het gaat om het unieke verhaal waarin dat algemene inzicht tot uiting komt d t moet goed zijn niet dat inzicht
6789129 ik zie niet zon verschil met wat ik nu denk en toen ik 18 was ik heb ook nooit een maatschappelijke carri re gehad mijn huwelijk en vaderschap kwamen zo laat dat ook die buitende geijkte patronen vielen nu ben ik weer fanatiek aan het wielrennen misschien ben ik ergens stil blijven staan maar ik hoef mezelf niet te begrijpen ik ben alleen maar materiaal voor mezelf
6789130 het heeft ook met mijn zoon te maken die nu 21 is mijn liefde voor een kind van veertien zoals ik die beschrijf in marte jacobs heeft ook met hem te maken marte jacobs had alleen kunnen ontstaan in een tijd waarin ik intiem was met iemand van die leeftijd
6789131 mijn boeken haalden jaar na jaar zelfs de longlist niet na de grot heb ik besloten de eer aan mezelf te houden kennelijk bestaat er een misverstand tussen mij en die jurys of zij zien niet hoe goed ik ben of ik denk per abuis dat ik goed genoeg ben voor een longlist als je je bij wielerwedstrijden keer op keer bij de eerste vijf klasseert en de jury zet je altijd op de 47ste plaats dan kom je allicht op het idee om daar niet meer aan mee te doen
6789132 nee ik heb genoeg slechte recensies gehad maar critici schatten mij redelijk naar waarde
6789133 de cpnb heeft andere overwegingen dan een jury zij hebben een bekende schrijver nodig die een goed boek van die lengte kan schrijven er zijn natuurlijk nog meer goede schrijvers in nederland maar het verbaasde me niet dat ze zo langzamerhand een keertje bij mij uitkwamen
6789134 misschien heeft het boek me in bepaalde kringen salonf hig gemaakt het is natuurlijk zo dat er van marte jacobs op geen enkele manier een thriller te maken is dat was iets wat het bekrompen deel van de literaire wereld graag met mijn boeken deed maar ik ga mijn tijd niet besteden aan het doen van veronderstellingen over de domheid van anderen ik schrijf boeken en men ziet maar
6789135 ik heb beloofd daar nog niets over te zeggen maar het komt zeker af op het bedoelde moment ik heb wel eens een film van de bouw van de afsluitdijk gezien gemaakt op het moment dat alle zandzakken op hun plaats liggen en de dijk dus dicht is zo ver ben ik al wel maar dan moet er nog een weg overheen er moeten sluizen in en huizen op ik heb daar nog ruim de tijd voor

6789140 the shows ive always been most proud of have a more theatrical narrative quality to them ive always loved that sort of thing ive even upped the ante with this show and have this beautiful set designed by christina smith that allows me to do a lot of physical stuff on it
6789141 i have no idea why i love this style of physical comedy and im surprised more people dont do it you do see a bit of it in the circus cabaret burlesque kind of area but not so much in the comedy world mr bean and jim carrey have been extremely successful but the trend just seems to be very much about comedians expressing who they are and not being as theatrical i love good stand up but it just surprises me that theres not a bigger variety of stuff happening

6789143 it was difficult at first i think i was trying a bit too hard it was this sort of neurotic thing maybe im just not interesting enough as myself rather than having faith in the ideas and letting them either fly or fail based on their merit
6789144 i let things ruminate for about 12 months and then got a lot more serious and started creating the story working out all the gags and training for the stunts

6789186 it made me laugh out loud and made me quite angry as well it really set the whole thing in motion for me and sparked things off to beat those stereotypes that pacific islanders are savages
6789187 the pacific islands are far away from most places in the world and its not a part of the world people know very well
6789188 they tend to only know the stereotypes which are coconut trees and smiling natives and hula girls and those kinds of things

6789365 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6789366 for me the important thing wasnt about rights or the benefits

6789370 we are a nation of animal lovers and many of us regard our pet as part of the family im not surprised that pet insurance is becoming so popular people will do everything they can to ensure the best for their pets
6789371 veterinary healthcare has made great strides in the last few years offering highly sophisticated treatment for a huge range of animal ailments
6789372 pet insurance helps owners choose the best treatment for their pets without worrying about costs

6789390 when it comes to the division situation in swift current with the respect to general practitioners we are o k
6789391 we are not in a good situation when it comes to our contingence of specialists we are awaiting the arrival of a second general surgeon it is going through the paper work now we have been operating with one general surgeon
6789392 with respect to our internal medicine we have a contingence of three usually
6789393 for most of you that dont know physicians in saskatchewan are paid in two ways either paid for the service or they are contracted to provide a service most often in our region most of the physicians are paid on a fee for service im not sure that all the people in our region fully understand whats involved there physicians by in large are private contractors they are professionals who provide a service and are reimbursed we have an interest in what they do certainly and we grant privileges for them to practice in our facility or facilities that are provided we allow them to order tests we allow them to admit people to our beds and in return we respect physicians to follow our policies and procedures to complete their charts on time to visit their patients to co operate with the health care workers that we have and provide safe care
6789394 our human resources physicians plan calls for 18 general practitioners in swift current and we currently have 18 now that may change as service plans change certainly we are more challenged in rural parts of the cypress health region than we are here in swift current smaller communities try to keep or retain or attract physicians and many of the smaller communities through changed patterns or preference are finding their way closer and closer to swift current
6789395 physicians may leave because they may want to practice in another area physicians often have the desire to practice closer to other family members it could be bad chemistry amongst colleagues and maybe they feel that they are not appreciated we understand that and we certainly do what we can as a health region to extend our appreciation on a regular basis to our physicians often the physicians also have a spouse that they need to fit into the community physicians may leave to go else where for more money as well some places are able to generate more hence physicians leave
6789396 the new hospital will be expanding the parking lot however this was not an area that we anticipate expanding however we do have funds to pave a section out there

6789413 there werent many of us playing those positions at that time
6789414 those positions were not ones you played we were part of the change that was starting to take hold in the sport
6789415 i tried to call him yesterday just to follow up
6789416 i expect to catch that ball ive got to catch that
6789417 id been playing punto to pull all night and he hit it right where i was supposed to be if it hits your glove youve got to catch that
6789418 i could have buried that split finger a little bit better than i did
6789419 i could have bounced it a little bit more and gone for the strikeout and if i did who knows what would have happened i do everything to prepare myself to pitch but im not getting the results i want its frustrating
6789420 nicky ripped it pretty good and torii had a long ways to go
6789421 weve seen him make plenty of catches like that and im glad he didnt make it but hes as good as they get out there we got a little lucky there
6789422 it all starts with pitching and scott baker was really really good going up against mr lackey whos always really good against us
6789423 we knew we were going to be in for a battle and it was its a nice start to a road trip
6789424 lackey can bear down and make pitches in situations like that as good as anybody in the game
6789425 we missed some opportunities but in those opportunities you look over at the other side and you see whos pitching he didnt miss too many spots
6789426 when you hit it good you kind of have that look
6789427 but i know this park and the ball doesnt really travel at night i hit it good enough but at 387 feet its a little deep i guess that was tough to swallow
6789428 well i guess he lied lets just forgive him afterall we fail too
6789429 the spirit that the song was written in does not validate or invalidate it can someone tell me what percentage of the churchs songs over the past 100 years were written out of a humble heart out of a heart longing to praise god out a heart looking to write a hit out of a heart looking for personal fame and glory out of a heart looking to glorify god nope no one can because we dont know so lets not pretend this even comes into the equation
6789430 if mike g was lying about this to everyone than clearly he is in need of some healing only its a different healing than he made us believe funny thing about god is that he can take the worst situations and find ways to bring glory to himself in them wouldnt it be amazing if god used mike to bring this song into our churches and then used the popularity of the song to expose mike for his lying and bring healing into his life i dont know it could happen

6789452 i like his position on national security primarily and the fact that hes pro life

6789457 the united states maintained about 130 military advisers in georgia along with civilian advisers contractors involved in all aspects of the georgian government and people doing business in georgia it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier u s technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions the russians clearly knew the georgians were ready to move how could the united states not be aware of the russians indeed given the posture of russian troops how could intelligence analysts have missed the possibility that the russians had laid a trap hoping for a georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack
6789458 seagulls are a menace to scottish towns and cities they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic
6789459 dumfries has a particular problem with gulls with regular reports of divebombing and litter strewn around the town after a seagull has raided a bin
6789460 i even read this week about a young paperboy who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
6789461 from rspb scotlands point of view compromising the overall conservation of species in unacceptable
6789462 ideally we want to encourage them to go and nest in more acceptable places and it is possible these measures will achieve that
6789463 the new team will be made up of local representatives and gull experts and will meet soon to consider ways in which gulls can be deterred from nesting in the town
6789464 by preventing gulls from nesting and destroying nests when discovered we can actively discourage them from breeding in dumfries and hopefully force them to look elsewhere
6789465 i expect the task force to start making plans now ready to swing into action next spring to coincide with the next breeding season
6789466 if successful lessons learned will be shared with other local authorities so they can see what has worked in dumfries with a view to implementing an appropriate response to problems in their area
6789467 i am sure this will prove to be a worthwhile exercise and an effective means of reducing numbers of nuisance birds in scotlands towns and cities
6789468 there is no doubt the dumfries population of gulls are getting bolder they are now stealing food from peoples hands and harassing locals and visitors its only a matter of time before a gull collides with someone and there is a serious injury
6789469 the time for discussion was at the gull summit in june now its time for action i am delighted the task force will be set up to remove nests and break up the gull colonies
6789470 there will be an array of gull experts on this group and i will be looking to them to do everything they can to rid dumfries of this problem
6789471 we have no problem with this and in fact we are very happy with the level of support we get from nhs lothian

6789493 he turned his back on his football brothers he could have helped but he didnt and families suffered as a result
6789494 i hope this shows the brevity of life for nfl players this was a tough guy and i think current nfl players dont understand how fragile life can be for even the toughest players maybe this will wake up the league
6789495 gene was a great football player the job he did to bring the players association to the position it is now in was tremendous i dont have to disagree with someone to respect them

6789816 the dams on the lower snake and mainstem columbia rivers have a significant impact on the fish and on the nez perce tribe
6789817 the tribe has simply agreed to disagree with the action agencies on several core issues regarding the impact of the mainstem columbia and lower snake river dams on salmon and steelhead
6789818 its disappointing but i think we have a game plan we think has a high level of promise for being successful
6789819 i dont want to pull the plug i want to talk
6789820 the tribe will continue to evaluate all settlement opportunities at every appropriate juncture

6789827 conflating grassroots political activism performance art queer theory and national politics new york based artist sharon hayes is staging two large scale public performances at both the 2008 democratic and republican national conventions as part of creative times summer long national program democracy in america the national campaign hayes is collaborating with 75 100 citizens in each city to recite in unison a text written by hayes that addresses the relationship between political desire and romantic desire the speakers will recite the 1 minute texts approximately 3 times over the course of an hour revolutionary love 2 is presented by creative time with the walker art center and the unconvention hayes performance is intended to be a spectacle and is designed to mirror the spectacular nature of the national conventions reacting against the tendency of groups to polarize feelings about homosexuality for political gain hayes describes these performances as personal addresses to the power structure or a group of people speaking their hearts as one
6789828 it is an escape from the reality of our times for a little while

6789830 teen challenge boasts about its program being saturated with fundamentalist christianity and makes it clear that required participation in religious activities is key to its approach
6789831 bush administration officials have claimed that they do not fund religious activities but this grant suggests otherwise
6789832 apparently their policy is to do it until they get caught
6789833 tax funds were being funneled to this organization even though it openly boasts about its religious content and theres no evidence its approach even works
6789834 this incident is a perfect example of whats so wrong with faith based initiatives
6789835 this was a clear example of unconstitutional support of religious coercion and discrimination im glad we were able to bring the matter to an appropriate conclusion
6789836 the democratic convention itself a carefully scripted and corporate funded media extravaganza is to be the culmination of a systematic shift to the right by the obama campaign
6789837 in this election once again the vast majority of the american people who oppose the war in iraq and the global escalation of american militarism are to be politically disenfranchised
6789838 istriku waktuku di dunia tidak lama lagi aku hanya titip pesan untuk anak kita bila sudah besar nanti
6789839 nanti ketika anak kita sudah besar dia akan tahu kita pernah menjadi keluarga yang kaya raya di kota ini
6789840 bila anak kita menanyakan kekayaan kita jawablah harta kekayaan itu milik alloh taala
6789841 bu benarkah keluarga kita dulu kaya raya seperti yang disampaikan orang orang
6789842 begini anak muda kebetulan anda akan mencari alloh bila nanti bertemu alloh tolong tanyakan mengapa surauku ini setiap selesai dibangun beberapa saat kemudian roboh dan itu terjadi berulang ulang sampai sekarang
6789843 jangan heran anak muda alloh telah menakdirkan kami untuk bisa berbicara seperti manusia kalau boleh tahu kamu dari mana dan mau kemana
6789844 saya berasal dari negeri yang jauh di timur dan tujuan saya adalah mencari alloh
6789845 nama saya ahmad saya dari negeri yang jauh di timur dan tujuan saya mencari alloh
6789846 kalau begitu bagaimana saya mengatakan pada orang orang yang titip pesan untuk disampaikan kepada alloh
6789847 katakan pada saya apa pesan mereka karena saya adalah seorang utusan alloh
6789848 hai ahmad katakan pada pemilik surau bila suraunya ingin jadi maka anak gadisnya harus segera dinikahkan kepada himar sampaikan untuk bisa gemuk harus ada yang menunggangi dan kepada kakek renta beliau belum akan mati sebelum emas berliannya disodaqohkan
6789849 saya sudah sampaikan pesan kakek tapi hanya kepada utusan alloh bukan kepada alloh
6789850 kakek bisa segera meninggal bila emas berlian yang kakek miliki disodaqohkan
6789851 wah kebetulan kalau begitu semua emas berlianku saya sodaqohkan kepadamu
6789852 sudah beliau berkata kamu bisa gemuk bila ada yang menaiki
6789853 baiklah yang satu saya naiki dan yang dua membawa dua karung emas berlian

6789855 go and produce have more kids dont worry about the number of kids you have we need to outnumber the jews and the christians
6789856 this really is to get people focused on the issues that we share and then boil them down to a narrow agenda
6789857 we are educated we are bright and we are able to land shiny side up if people dont keep flipping us over
6789858 there are a lot of issues we dont have in common but there are also a lot of issues that we do
6789859 ive started dating sharon stone and shes pretty good for 50
6789860 sharon called him and he showed the caller id to everyone
6789861 shes really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
6789862 its just a business decision if youre upside down 250 000 why would you keep it it just doesnt make sense
6789863 we would like to speak to anyone who has information that could help with the investigation particularly those who attended a party in mongeham road on friday august 15
6789864 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6789865 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6789866 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6789867 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6789868 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6789869 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long
6789870 furthermore the county has never adopted goals or policies to guide the development of these tiny lots he said
6789871 vi vill bevisa hur l tt det r att ta n gon annans identitet

6789875 does not sit well with some of the people involved in the process
6789876 les bombes sous munitions tuent civils et enfants bien apr s la fin des guerres et cette semaine nous avons loccasion de les bannir
6789877 we have a blind spot when it comes to calling children overweight or obese
6789878 we tend to normalise it and say its just puppy fat but thats not the case
6789879 we need to raise awareness that overweight children become overweight adults
6789880 what were seeing is children sitting in front of tvs and computers far more than ever before
6789881 were the first generation in history that has had to deal with this problem
6789882 but the kids are our future and theyre worth the effort
6789883 its hard to know how they compare against what other children are eating because we dont have a lot of information about the diets of australian kids
6789884 but were eagerly awaiting the results of the 2007 national nutrition survey for children where well get a better idea of what these kids are eating
6789885 dairying in alaska is not for the faint hearted i can tell you that right now
6789886 here youd better be prepared to do it yourself inventorying parts and expediting them if you dont have them
6789887 you get people who are hiding out or who are looking for some kind of utopia
6789888 when we first started here in alaska we were told it couldnt be done
6789889 were only going to produce 100 percent alaska milk here
6789890 it was a cliffhanger wasnt it in all senses it is always pleasing to win those ones so it takes a bit of pressure off
6789891 i think wayne bennett said at half time they had 22 sets to our 13 so to come in 14 6 down was a good effort from our defence
6789892 i was pretty crook today some sort of bug i got but once i got on the field the atmosphere took over and it was good
6789893 thats the thing with field goals the whole team comes screaming out at you and there is always going to be a few holes in the defence after that
6789894 he is terrific always puts himself in the right spot at the right time i suppose that is why he is the champion he is
6789895 local derby they were desperate we were desperate semi final type footy and i think we showed that we can compete
6789896 i think our defence itself was tough enough we took plenty of confidence out of it we knew our time with the ball would come and we got our points
6789897 the possibility that cannabis may have impaired his mr clarks judgement and or handling of complex tasks cannot be excluded
6789898 descended in an attempt to keep below cloud but then found there appeared to be a
6789899 he decided to turn left towards rochester and descended in an attempt to remain clear of the cloud
6789900 he then saw trees ahead that he was unable to avoid
6789901 the pilot in a statement to police described himself as a regular heavy cannabis user smoking a large amount each evening
6789902 loss of precision skills and slowed reaction are two documented effects of cannabis which make it incompatible with flying
6789903 you mean like this he points to what looks like a rusty stanley 5 or 5 1 2
6789904 in 35 years everything that went to the hungry came from the ashland talent community
6789905 yeah nothing pretty i want to actually to plane with it
6789906 you dont regard those people as the poorest of the poor and they dont regard themselves as the poorest of the poor
6789907 a lot of people think they make too much for them to get on this plan
6789908 we can take him to his checkups and he can get his immunizations
6789909 without that he wouldnt be able to its like 300 400 bucks an appointment
6789910 the main thing that we would want them to do is clean it up
6789911 there is no reason new turf should have this much lead in it why put lead in products that kids are going to play on
6789912 the lead is imbedded in plastic but exposure to uv light and weathering makes the lead become available
6789913 so it is a question of how much will come out get picked up on hands or released into dust to be breathed in that is the challenge
6789914 what we find is that there is enough lead coming off to be a violation of california law
6789915 there could only potentially be a health risk if lead is leaving the field and leaving the field in amounts that are detrimental to kids
6789916 and the cpsc found that the amount of lead that would need to be ingested is absurd
6789917 none of our turf fields is on a replacement schedule at this time
6789918 our district is working on a comprehensive replacement cycle for facilities and equipment in the future but that work is yet to be completed we hope to get 10 12 or even 15 years of use out of the turf before replacing it but that depends on how well it holds up through the years
6789919 safety is our no 1 priority when it comes to our facilities
6789920 it is not just the students that use our facilities its the staff and community members there is organized and unorganized use of the fields so we are concerned about the safety we need to know if there is an exposure risk or is the lead there contained if there is exposure is it at a risky level
6789921 the primary concerns about lead are neurological and especially developmental
6789922 it really impairs development in rapidly developing neurological systems and developing brains the more it is studied the lower the levels at which we are able to document impairments
6789923 the primary concerns about lead are neurological and especially developmental
6789924 it really impairs development in rapidly developing neurological systems and developing brains the more it is studied the lower the levels at which we are able to document impairments
6789925 great i have a message from this friend i dont often hear from
6789926 everybodys talking about the new ringtones for your cell phone
6789927 i wonder why my friend would send me such a post
6789928 dad are you kidding you never respond to those things
6789929 the problem isnt my message it is the hearer of the message
6789930 the problem includes the enemys work of sowing in some who arent real
6789931 there are so few conifers in this area of the trail no matter how often private citizens damage publicly owned trees it is always shocking
6789932 weve quit going to any parties up the hill because theyll just talk about how awful our trees are
6789933 i hope they find whoever did it this is not the right way to go
6789934 i dont understand why anybody would do this we need more trees right now with global warming not fewer
6789935 the start was terrible and the end wasnt that great but im still blessed
6789936 im grateful to say that i am disappointed with this medal when so many people dont get the opportunity to say that im grateful im happy and im going to hold my head up and be proud about it
6789937 i feel like it was a really good race for me
6789938 it was my personal best for this season i knew i needed to get out quick because dayron robles is a very fast starter i wanted to be up there with him and i got medal for the usa im glad to be able to prove that i can do it when im supposed to be here our race would have been a lot faster with the previous world record holder liu xiang and terrence trammel in there but it was still a great race a couple of years ago nobody knew who david oliver or i was
6789939 i got a medal we wanted to come in and go 1 2 3 david and me went in and held up our end of the bargain they only hand out three medals every four years to get one of them youll always be remembered some of the all time greats have never gotten a medal
6789940 i felt good coming out of the turn but when i tried to go i didnt have anything left
6789941 bernankes optimism is likely to be translated as ongoing dovishness his expectations that inflation will ease again suggest no urgency to remove accommodation and this plays into the notion that the fed is on hold for the foreseeable future his positive comments on the dollar aside the interest rate implications of his remarks are dollar negative
6789942 the way bernanke can try to uphold the feds inflation fighting credentials while leaving real interest rates in negative territory when headline and core inflation are unacceptably high is to focus on his dovish outlook for inflation saying that inflation is all going to go away
6789943 we will get some relief on headline inflation because oil has come off but that leaves open the question of how lasting that relief will be and what will happen to core inflation in the meantime i think core inflation will go up id like to see what bernanke does if oil goes back to the highs as the economy slides
6789944 the emphasis still is on the economic and market risks but still trying to walk a fine line on inflation as well
6789945 there is nothing to suggest the fed would do another easing
6789946 there will be no change in monetary policy for the foreseeable future he is continuing to focus on the same themes that the board has been focusing on
6789947 on liquidity facilities there is the acknowledgement that balance sheet strains remain and the fed will continue to make adjustments as needed
6789948 ben bernankes comments are not really new if anything his remarks on the stability of the dollar should be seen as positive the overall bias remains supportive to the dollar but with lingering concerns on the u s credit market and with oil prices bouncing back and forth i would expect some volatility in the dollar within the next couple of weeks
6789949 we think the fed is on hold for a while thats kind of been priced in to the market for a while so theres not a lot of boat rocking going on here the one thing that is enough to raise my eyebrow is the fact that he is specifically applauding the rise in the dollar usually the fed has nothing at all to say about the currency at one point the fed was almost cheerleading the weakness saying it was good for exports etcetera that changed after he made those dollar comments in june it seems like hes kind of pushing the same idea here
6789950 headlines for everyone bulls bears bernanke said rates relatively low coupled with financial crisis not yet subsided so far markets are unsure how to take the headlines
6789951 the inflation numbers have been moving up in recent releases but bernanke seems to be saying that the fed is essentially going to remain on hold i think the market is maybe removing some of the expectations that have been voiced about the fed being poised for rate hikes my view has always been that the major central banks will not have any rate increases at least until the middle of next year what bernanke has said what weve heard from trichet confirms this the markets seem to be bouncing like a pinball between what happens in commodity prices to what happens in credit to what happens with interest rates thats probably not going to stop any time soon
6789952 well i like a lot of what the ndp stands for but
6789953 will this zealots issue likely become a matter of a government bill
6789954 its just ludicrous to think that oregonians in general only eat two fish meals a month
6789955 my family eats a lot more than that and so do many people in astoria or coos bay or portland
6789956 the technology is not even known to treat down to the level of contaminants were talking about
6789957 and the sewage plants are such a small amount of the total discharge that spending the dollars that way will not solve the problem
6789958 the market conditions have to be favourable and high density zoning has to be in place
6789959 this volume makes an unparalleled contribution to the growing and vital field of measurement and human rights the book offers a useful categorization and assessment of repressive and rogue states allowing us to measure the extenet of repressive state behavior more accurately his rotberg work should embolden external critiques and facilitate more transparent and accountable foreign policy
6789960 in the first free practice session we concentrated on learning the new circuit
6789961 the surface was still very dirty in the morning so we had to wait until the track picked up some grip in the second free practice the conditions were better although it was still quite slippery and our main focus was on tyre evaluation and basic set up work anyway the track conditions were changing every thirty minutes because of this it is quite tricky to make a prediction for tomorrow we now have to analyse the data
6789962 i really like the new valencia street circuit as they have done a very good job on the lay out of course at the start the track was extremely dirty but obviously the conditions are the same for everybody we had no technical problems and i was able to do the tyre comparison as planned im not happy with the lap times yet so now we shall look into the data and figure out how we can improve
6789963 although this is a new track there were no surprises for us as regards the cars set up the circuit is as we expected and we were well prepared as usual on friday we concentrated on comparing the tyres and race preparation we were able to complete the programme without any technical problems because we cannot use any previous information to refer to for this new track we shall now analyse all the data we shall pay special attention to comparing the sector times so we can make the right set up changes for the rest of the weekend
6789964 es una forma de que se te valore tu trabajo
6789965 we are sincere in this effort i consider it as my personal religious obligation to defend cebu against misguided elements from muslim mindanao
6789966 im thankful that we have a good relationship with our muslim brothers and the recent dialogue has renewed and strengthened our cooperation
6789967 if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
6789968 if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is
6789969 i could not believe that i was out and when i heard last night i was in the final it was my time

6789979 the bullying and adversity made him be stronger and work harder
6789980 i have won gold in the world championships many times but i was expecting something really special at the olympics and i got it im delighted
6789981 many democrats have been worried about obamas ability to fight back against mccains attacks
6789982 i married a rich lady after dumping my disabled first wife her daddys hard work has allowed me to work for the whiners who arent really experiencing a downturn economy

6789987 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6789988 we investigated it so thoroughly beyond any expectation you might have i can tell you
6789989 i dont think this story is anything like the way theyve portrayed it i think this guy chose to do this
6789990 given the site of the attack he was making a political statement
6789991 most people with allergies are atopic meaning they have a genetic tendency to develop allergies to detect the genetic factors we examined the genomes of more than 10 000 adults and children from the whole of germany
6789992 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
6789993 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
6789994 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
6789995 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
6789996 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
6789997 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
6789998 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
6789999 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
