4950045 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4950046 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4950047 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4950077 its been such an unbelievable ride with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it took was a little imagination

4950079 to be honest i was thinking not to blow the lead
4950080 i was really nervous going into this race i just wanted to take it out as hard as i could and hold on as strong as i could
4950081 without the help of my relay teammates this isnt possible
4950082 this is all still under investigation to determine the cause and origin of the fire so i wont speculate at this time
4950083 nothing at the present time however shows that it has any signs of arson
4950084 to my knowledge in the apartments all codes were met the real issue was the building under construction because that obviously didnt have all the safety precautions where fire is concerned since it was still being built
4950085 with the amount of plywood and glue making up that structure it went up like a lumber yard and the radiant heat just caused it to spread

4950094 the point is familiarity and control and mastery said tenhuisen
4950095 that they have the opportunity to overcome and figure it out on their own
4950096 ill show a 2 year old the anesthesia mask before they go in so they can feel it and play with it said candy nyce director of the department of child life at st christophers hospital for children which like childrens hospital has had a formal program for more than 50 years

4950118 look everyone is going to die the only issue is what you do while you are alive
4950119 why cant people be told there are aliens on earth people are smart

4950122 recent events have shown how fragile the current provision of internet in malta can be there are for the moment only two cables connecting the local internet to the european backbone each of them owned by a private company regulations should be in place for extraordinary events each cable operator has to be allowed to use appropriate bandwidth from its competitor when technical faults occur in their cable connectivity
4950123 during the internet cable connectivity interruption which happened to go 10days ago the public realized that there was no real fallback procedure in place go users were not able to use the international internet connection as malta has a particular geographical position and connectivity to the international hub is only provided by two companies the mca has to make sure that these serious events do not happen again it is not acceptable to have to wait months or years till alternative cables to the next hub are put in place
4950124 eighty pitches would be no problem in the next start eighty five would be no problem im ready for that i just have to wait and see what role im in
4950125 my stamina was good the command of all my pitches was there
4950126 i feel the same as i did before the injury
4950127 you give him a couple looks if he looks like he can help us he gets a little more playing time so far so good
4950128 i look at what i can do today im not looking too far ahead right now
4950129 if they give me the ball in the ninth inning thats my responsibility its what im used to doing
4950130 some rookies are just wide eyed and happy to be here they dont think about whats necessary to be successful here the three of us have a lot of confidence in ourselves
4950131 its not as though we expected to be here but were comfortable being here we want to establish roles and be part of the team a lot of it has to do with how you carry yourself
4950132 it would be nice to play it out see how many we get then go back and look at it
4950133 we really cant lose any kind of concentration there is nothing automatic about it but weve got a lot of guys going about it right
4950134 the good teams at this point seem to get hungrier for the end of the season
4950135 its crunch time for all the good teams wed certainly like to continue this roll this is when you start to see the good teams start to win most of their games id like to put us in that category
4950136 we fought it early this year we pitch good days and not hit hit good days and not pitch some days it was a combination of both
4950137 hopefully this is a stretch where we can really put a run together to have a good stretch run youve got to do both
4950138 i wouldnt be playing if something was bothering me im hitting 350 were winning i dont see the problem im telling you im fine are you going to believe what im saying or what other people are saying its up to you
4950139 i guess the home runs havent come as often or whatever but he doesnt get pitches to hit the numbers dont lie if he gets pitches to hit hes going to do some damage
4950140 weve been hovering on that line between being a good team and a real good team with a late push we can be a real good team
4950141 i know ill probably get questioned about a number of things like that nagging little touchdown draught
4950142 but it really doesnt matter to me because we got our first win of the preseason and our first win at home so you can ask me anything you want im a happy man so fire away
4950143 and to be honest with you we accomplished our goal so you can ask me anything you want and im a happy man
4950144 it wasnt so much to break the preseason touchdown spell or whatever it is
4950145 it was more kind of a determination check i was really proud of offensive line our backs ran well
4950146 we didnt score and thats obviously our no 1 goal
4950147 but we moved the ball well enough to come away satisfied with this win
4950148 ive been playing a long time and i know this business is wins and losses
4950149 you either score a touchdown or you didnt as far as myself and the first unit we didnt so were going to keep working on that
4950150 tucker got me when my arm was coming forward and i wanted to make sure my rotator cuff was still in place just for a minute there it felt weird i threw a little bit in the third quarter on the sidelines and it felt fine
4950151 its always fun when they dial up the run and we run the ball well
4950152 thats what we did we matched up really well and pounded on them
4950153 im sure players do it all the time he said on the first day of preseason practice
4950154 its fine in the summer thats positive motivation and theres respect that goes with that
4950155 its still about the process and working hard every day pinkel said
4950156 spending time thinking about being ranked is not very smart
4950157 the thing weve talked about since weve gotten back from california is were not there yet illinois coach ron zook said
4950158 we still have a long long way to go we have to continue to remember how we were able to make the progress we were able to do
4950159 theyre going to be a really good football team i told people last year they would be and by the end of the year they were listening to me its a great rivalry and a great way to start the season
4950160 every time weve been here we havent been able to see more than several hundred meters its like a whole new place and its beautiful
4950161 its kind of like wow i cant believe its here
4950162 i think its best going into this race thinking its just a triathlon
4950163 its what we do every time obviously theres a little bit more a lot more going on but when it comes down to it its doing what you do swim bike run
4950164 but i feel like every athlete has to make the decision that they felt was best for them
4950165 that looks like something that will probably be season ending
4950166 it couldnt have been good i know he was in extreme pain
4950167 i went from hitting my head on the wall to win by 001 to doing my best time in every event
4950168 it shows how much teamwork and togetherness and we have
4950169 its great to be a part of history i wouldnt be able to wear these gold medals if he werent part of this team too
4950170 michael phelps is definitely the greatest swimmer in olympic history however in my opinion he is not the greatest olympic athlete ever yet
4950171 i do not mean to denigrate phelps achievements but swimmers and gymnasts have a great advantage in that it is easier for them to win multiple gold medals in a single olympics i give extra credit to track athletes because running is the basic of sports and the most widely practiced
4950172 we will have to see what phelps can do in london in 2012
4950173 the goals that i have and am working toward is in progress
4950174 when your lungs are burning and you can hardly feel your arms and youre battling a guy head to head and then all of a sudden he gets a turbo boost and youve got to run him down
4950175 the great ones jordan woods montana seem to not only win but win in the most dramatic fashion blending excellence with great theater
4950176 i was just pinching myself at a committee meeting last tuesday
4950177 i was reminding everyone that were three weeks from tee off time and thinking how did we get here so fast are we really ready
4950178 and then the reports i got were really great i found out just how ready we are the experience weve gained through having the 2004 u s senior open and the experience we had in getting ready for the 2001 american express championship has prepared us pretty well with the people weve had in place
4950179 sales have been affected it would be naive to think they wouldnt be
4950180 the week following tigers announcement ticket sales went down half of what they were and its taken several weeks to recover to that level youd have to just guess at how many tickets you dont sell because of tiger not being here
4950181 thats more than we had for the first two days of the senior open
4950182 thats 35 40 percent more than we had for the senior open
4950183 it is important to us to maintain the credibility for previous sales and for future sales
4950184 we feel thats the best and only way to do that the tickets which include complimentary parking are sold for 225 and each ticket can be transferred so its not like if you only want to go one day youre stuck you can still do that and distribute tickets for other days to your friends
4950185 i remember it had lots of trees big greens a real old fashioned golf course im looking forward to playing it
4950186 man tar en grej som inte r en grej och s t nker man efter och ser om den nd kan f rkl s till grej det gick ganska bra
4950187 we must act professionally and responsibly regarding the budget irrespective of primaries and to demonstrate stability
4950188 im just really relieved to get back safe and sound after the ordeal up there
4950189 and im just glad its all over and im looking forward to sleeping in a bed tonight
4950190 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4950191 i didnt care because im not much on politics i remember that happening but i wasnt going anyway
4950192 the power of adversity tough times can make you stronger wiser and better

4950194 the power of adversity tough times can make you stronger wiser and better
4950195 we are not meant in the grand scheme of life to be happy and comfortable rather we are meant to forge our characters on the anvil of adversity
4950196 i dreamed of working alongside my father as heir in waiting to the presidency of the weatherhead co
4950197 i severed all ties with my father over our dispute about my place in the family business a schism that sent me on weeklong drunken binges in squalid flop houses
4950198 i was always afraid that he would walk out again
4950199 i kept celia at arms length by being a workaholic like my father subjecting our relationship to a slow painful death by a thousand cuts
4950200 if you want to save yourself and if you want to save our marriage you have to get out of bed
4950201 my illness forced me to realize that i not only needed other people but i was also literally at their mercy
4950202 so i began to trust celia but then i realized just how desperately much i wanted to trust her
4950203 as i look back i now see that suffering pain and the threat of death were the only hard lessons strong enough to break through the thickness of my hard head
4950204 eventually i came to see these adversities for what they were blessings in disguise that i learned to leverage to make me a stronger wiser more loving and creative human being
4950205 he became more than a patient hes a friend and benefactor
4950206 it didnt start out that way but als the sort of person who tests things out if you pass he gives you a little to keep you going then if you succeed he gives you a little more and a little more thats how we grew together
4950207 we have never written about them and quite frankly hadnt heard of them until now
4950208 a lot of donors go out of their way to cultivate an image as big givers apparently the weatherhead foundation does good work and doesnt seek attention
4950209 i dont like wearing a tuxedo and going to big dinners i dont want to be in the spotlight
4950210 i wrote this book to help others learn from the mistakes ive made
4950211 i want people to know that life is filled with adversity and nobody is guaranteed to be happy but they dont have to be unhappy and self destructive like i was
4950212 you need a game plan and make sure you are organized
4950213 we are hoping to have matt barr to play hardy brown
4950214 we are very excited to welcome one of borders new concept stores to watters creek
4950215 borders is already a great store for books and entertainment but i think customers are really going to be impressed with what they find at this location this store adds another unique and important element to the mix at watters creek
4950216 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
4950217 we have got to go away and grow away from the callow and puerile philosophy that this situation will go away its frightfully difficult but will be richly rewarding if we work together we can find workable sensible and achievable ways to get through this period
4950218 one of the hard things about lyme disease is youre not always visibly sick but you feel really bad and nobodys really believing you
4950219 this is august and im wearing a hoodie and shivering
4950220 i walked like ms and looked like ms but it wasnt
4950221 if he had begun treating me for ms i could have died
4950222 i had been sick at least eight years by the time i was diagnosed i was already in late stage lyme disease
4950223 its a constant struggle you have to be really strong
4950224 i have brain damage so i dont make good sense sometimes
4950225 i can no longer do the career that i loved ive lost that identity there are constant losses
4950226 i focus not on how many days i have left but on what to do with those days
4950227 my question is how can i help people now that the door to my career has closed i have to find another door
4950228 hes my best friend i dont know what i would do without him my son and my daughter
4950229 in that way im the luckiest person in the world
4950230 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
4950231 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
4950232 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
4950233 america is in great difficulty and we are experiencing enormous economic challenges as well as others
4950234 i have a huge concern for the level of addiction
4950235 i think this is a really important issue for our state
4950236 this is very important public health and public safety issue
4950237 addicts are going to break into houses they are going to steal from family members and they are going to commit armed robberies i talk about it in terms of a quality of life issue

4950255 the fifteenth day of the seventh month is the pravarana day for the assembled sangha of the ten directions
4950256 this disciples parents have received the power of the merit and virtue of the triple jewel because of the awesome spiritual power of the assembled sangha if in the future the buddhas disciples practice filiality by offering up the ullambana basins will they be able to cross over their present fathers and mothers as well as those of seven generations past
4950257 good indeed i am happy you asked that question i just wanted to speak about that and now you have also asked about it
4950258 those disciples of the buddha who cultivate filial conduct should in thought after thought constantly recall their present fathers and mothers when making offerings as well as the fathers and mothers of seven lives past every year on the fifteenth day of the seventh month they should always out of filial compassion recall their parents who bore them and those of seven lives past and for their sakes perform the offering of the ullambana basin to the buddha and the sangha and thus repay the loving kindness of the parents who raised and nourished them all buddhas disciples should respectfully receive this dharma

4950279 two thirds academic stuff im working on and one third politics
4950280 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
4950281 we believe this was caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam
4950282 we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression
4950283 the last wave was this past week and now it got very quiet
4950284 malicious intentions at all its just that spammers can literally overrun a service if youre not careful so their defenses have become overzealous
4950285 the treasurys refusal to provide scotland with the funds to implement the new pension scheme for the police and fire and rescue services is bewildering
4950286 this is a clear cut case of spending rising in england and wales in a devolved area due to a decision taken on a uk wide basis and thus scotland should receive its fair share of extra funding via a barnett consequential
4950287 the police and our fire and rescue services are far too important to be treated in this way by the uk government
4950288 our members deserve better after a lifetime of placing themselves in danger to protect the public
4950289 the funding of pensions is too big a burden for individual police forces
4950290 the snp must face up to their responsibilities in government and implement the new pensions calculations for retiring police officers in scotland
4950291 kenny macaskill must also look seriously at the possibility of funding police pensions centrally from holyrood so that our police forces and local authorities budgets are not stretched beyond their limits by the increased number of retiring officers and increased life expectancy

4950297 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
4950298 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4950299 prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
4950300 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
4950301 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
4950302 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4950303 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government

4950310 the integration of ukrainian elements of missile early warning and space control systems with those of foreign countries that are interested in gathering space data
4950311 could prevent any actions like those which occurred on 7 8 august at first in south ossetia and then in other regions of georgia
4950312 this subversive terrorist act resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4950313 moreover the bridge used to provide a route for refugees from the russian occupied territories into safe places russia is pursuing deliberate policy aimed at undermining georgias statehood including through bringing about humanitarian catastrophe
4950314 russian military helicopters started bombing the bordering territories of the city of borjomi and settlement of tsemi using incendiary munitions
4950315 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4950316 arrests have been made under the charges of waging war against the state and also for murder both unbailable offenses
4950317 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4950318 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4950319 obviously the guys perfect for ipod its always in his ear
4950320 any kind of video games i hear hes a big video game player something automotive he really hasnt delved into that vitaminwater any type of energy drink seems to be a nice fit anything water based that way obviously fast food the guys got this incredible appetite i dont know if youve seen what he eats he eats like a dozen eggs a day just being the spokesperson for you know the egg board makes a lot of sense
4950321 kind of a cold competitive edge la michael jordan or tiger woods and kind of a kid next door accessibility
4950322 hes good looking healthy vital pure its sort of a clich of what america is about
4950323 in that sense he represents a gold mine to marketers this guy kind of comes out of the blue and sort of says when we were an innocent land and things were simpler and less complex this is the image america had beyond being an athlete he conveys the possibility that america can be that kind of place again
4950324 and his exposure will not come for free after the games are over
4950325 if we start seeing him on dancing with the stars and american idol and whatever its looking a little desperate
4950326 we want freedom indians go home and kashmir is ours
4950327 these guys made it possible the relay really made it possible it shows how much teamwork and togetherness we have i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport without the help of my teammates it wouldnt have been possible we all came together as one unit
4950328 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second friday night to finishing it off with a world record its an amazing experience and something ill never forget
4950329 i went from hitting my head on the wall to win by 1 100th of a second to doing my best time in every event its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster its been nothing but fun
4950330 the biggest thing is nothing is impossible all it takes is an imagination i dont even know what to feel right now so many emotions i guess i kind of just want to see my mum
4950331 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest of all time and the greatest olympian of all hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4950332 there was a lot of pressure on carols shoulders and now the pressure is on her coaches shoulders

4950338 the average wrestler probably retires about 100 times a year and sometimes three or four times in a day
4950339 its tough its physical and its emotional you get tired and you get battered and bruised and sometimes you just want to pitch it
4950340 this ones a bit different because i won my match to get to the podium whereas a silver you lost so its a different emotion
4950341 but i have to say im really really happy with my performance
4950342 weve got ballet beams and chalkboards and theyre all bent from wrestlers banging into them
4950343 theres a lot of people who are winning gold medals here who dont come from the most glamourous environments
4950344 does that build the strength and the character and the motivation to produce medals i think theres some merit to that
4950345 the last four years have been a character builder for me
4950346 for me to finish off like this because this will be my last olympics i really cant complain
4950347 im a little bit reluctant to change the environment that has produced success
4950348 might catch diabetes like caitlin and have to take ouchie shots
4950349 the baseline study allows for us to determine where we need to be in terms of addressing issues
4950350 if the customers end up being people who live in battle creek and instead of going to a picture show or to grab a bite on beckley road they go to the casino it will have a dampening impact
4950351 the influx of visitors to calhoun county will be significant
4950352 what happens is that as people spend more and more of their disposable income at the casino that money doesnt go into other areas of the economy
4950353 so theres a net balance of zero jobs and all thats left is the addiction the crime and the corruption
4950354 were going to set up the information and do whats necessary to overcome it
4950355 but were providing jobs for the immediate area and thats going to be a real asset to all governments battle creek marshall albion thats just going to improve those areas
4950356 the economic opportunities will speak louder than anything we might say to calm peoples concerns
4950357 but i dont think crime is going to be out of control
4950358 weve never been for it but you cant stop progress
4950359 i felt like it was my destiny and i achieved it
4950360 i dont think its the biggest win in my career but in the sport it is this solidifies me as a world champion and that was the one title i was missing
4950361 everybody the whole time was like you live here why arent you playing in it
4950362 i told dave i would caddy for him and i was like i know hes going to win so why would i play and risk my money when i can caddy for dave and he can give me some of his money
4950363 i wish my dad was here to see this he died 30 years ago and i wish he was here to enjoy this with me and i want to dedicate this to my dad don weimer
4950364 i havent ate in like three days and i havent had much sleep
4950365 he was talking to us and he said who would have thought that the no
4950366 well im no 1 in the world and i came from cold brook as well that was great inspiration for me i held that in my head all week and it really inspired me
4950367 it doesnt matter where you are from you can do it anybody that hasnt played disc golf you got to get out and play its a very addictive sport and its a lot cheaper than ball golf
4950368 its been a beautiful week its been a great experience on these courses
4950369 its physical here at timber ridge walking up the mountains and then we go to cold brook and were shooting through these gaps and its the mental game you play so its been a grueling week but it was well worth it
4950370 ive heard nothing but a lot of happy people and thats what you really want in this event that people came here had a good time
4950371 i really havent played a lot of competitive golf this summer as opposed to other summers
4950372 easy summer thus far has consisted instead of qualifying and or playing in events like the michigan open the michigan amateur the western amateur and a u
4950373 but the way i look at it im still hitting the ball as good as i was a couple of months ago im still swinging good and i just keep on trying to keep my rounds together thompson said
4950374 i did that today my only bad hole all day today was a double bogey on no 2 on the marsh when i hit my driver into the hazard on the right and had to drop and that was my only bad shot so im hoping to keep it together again tomorrow too
4950375 i was playing well that first nine making a lot of good putts said the 2005 parchment high grad
4950376 but on that back nine i didnt make a lot of good putts just a lot of routine pars hopefully i can play both nines well today
4950377 i didnt hit the ball that well today with my irons but i birdied four of the last six holes coming in on the marsh said rutherford wholl be a senior at lakeview this year
4950378 i was just making a lot of putts down the stretch and hopefully something like that will carry over to today
4950379 i played pretty good today a 36 on the preserve with a birdie and a 34 on the marsh with four birdies lebarre said
4950380 but i play at riverside with those young guys a lot and let me tell you tomorrow its going to be different those young guys hit it too far for us old guys to keep up with its going to be something
4950381 if its going to bring jobs its desperately needed around here
4950382 its a very nice neighborhood all the neighbors get along well
4950383 our main concern is traffic and people spending their grocery money gambling
4950384 they called to let us know when the construction would be starting and when they would be putting up the temporary fencing between the site and properties on ackerson drive
4950385 i really dont think its going to be as invasive as some of the things they were talking about putting in there
4950386 this is going to be the perfect spot for anybody traveling everything else would have been an eyesore with no jobs coming in its troublesome to me that youve got to leave our area to get a job
4950387 you cannot believe the fights weve had up in that field
4950388 that way we could just take a golf cart over there and not worry about traffic
4950389 we can run over there with the gas money we would have spent to go somewhere else
4950390 people are going to spend their money at other businesses
4950391 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4950392 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4950393 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4950394 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4950395 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4950396 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4950397 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4950398 i think the opportunities in the future are going to be immense
4950399 weve always said that we are going to bring jobs
4950400 id like to see help for our elders giving help to our members with employment opportunities and job training
4950401 we wanted to highlight heart disease to bring it to the forefront and really make it the focus
4950402 obesity related diseases are what african americans are dying from in droves type ii diabetes heart disease
4950403 when they leave here they know where they are and where they should be for their age and gender
4950404 its kind of my vow of humility to those that came before us theres a story in every single bracelet
4950405 when this first occurred i said whatever the republicans do with their delegations we will do the same the difference is we will have a food fight in the middle
4950406 it seems our party cannot avoid having a free for all
4950407 it has always been my opinion that the michigan delegation would have a full vote at the convention
4950408 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
4950409 democrats in florida and michigan must know they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
4950410 they had nothing im pretty sure i learned my work ethic from them they worked so hard for us to have a better life
4950411 they did everything my dad was a carpenter for a while he worked odd jobs then he worked at a saw mill my mom she waitressed and then eventually they owned a small 12 room hotel in hazelton b c which they just sold in may the bulkley valley motel

4950531 the highest usage areas in our library now are the public computers with internet access although most of the time the crowd is younger and usually communicating with friends some older notable gaming website design researchers will come in and go straight for internet completely ignoring the card catalog

4950616 our highly trained and well equipped emergency personnel are working with our local partners to contain the fire and limit the damage
4950617 as long as were at the table were going to keep pursuing that
4950618 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4950619 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4950620 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4950621 we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state but our goal was to remain here in pittsburgh all the way those trips to kansas city and vegas and other cities was just to go and have a nice dinner and come back

4950624 dis nie die nuwe man in my lewe nie ons is baie goeie vriende
4950625 meer bek as binnegoed wat kan uithelp met data en informasie jy weet mos hoe dit rerig was
4950626 as die waterkloof vier skuld beken en berou getoon het was hulle nou al uit die tronk k glo hulle sou glad nie tronkstraf gekry het nie hulle was minderjarig eerste oortreders daar was drank betrokke
4950627 ek voel s oneindig jammer vir hulle hulle voel soos my eie kinders
4950628 ek is oortuig daarvan as hul ouers vandag weer kon kies sou hulle eerder my pad die w rheidpad gevolg het hulle h t die keuse gehad en hulle of hul regsadviseurs het daardie arme seuns verkeerd gelei
4950629 s vir die mense daar buite jy kry n oproep en die stem s meneer jou kinders is by n moord betrokke
4950630 s maklik gebeur dit wat as dit j kind is
4950631 leer my les weet wat jou kind doen moenie een van daardie afwesige ouers wees nie wat hom geld in die hand stop en die strate instuur
4950632 ek s vandag vir jou daars h pe kinders wat steeds by sulke goed betrokke is
4950633 ja hulles sulke rammetjie uitnek macho mannetjies wat oral skoor soek hulle kom weg deur hi r een te karnuffel d r een n opstopper te gee hulle hol agter n swarte n park in en voordat hulle hul o kan uitvee is dit moord en dan probeer hulle wegkom daarmee
4950634 ek kan vir jou h nderd antwoorde gee oor daardie aand feit bly dit was verk rd of dit nou n swart man of n geel man of wat ook al was dit was verkeerd
4950635 ekt in elk geval geweet die ding sal die een of ander tyd w l uitkom jy sal nooit n storie kan stilhou tussen ses minderjarige kinders nie
4950636 maar reinard se reaksie was miskien my grootste motivering om polisie toe te gaan hyt die aand in die parkie gestaan en toekyk sensitief n introvert kon hy dit glad nie verwerk nie hyt gedreig om selfmoord te pleeg
4950637 watse waarheid die waarheid s uit eks jammer vir haar dat sy n sewe jaar nie daarby kon uitkom nie om te s dit gaan nie oor jou as ma nie jou kind w s verkeerd dit help nie jy hou aan toesmeer nie jy sterk daai kind net v rder in sy kwaad
4950638 n net twee vrae het johann kruger staatsaanklaer die mat onder sy voete uitgepluk
4950639 daardie vier jong manne ek wil nie eens dink aan hul situasie nie maar dalk is dit die lewensles wat hulle nou moet leer om as beter mense anderkant uit te stap
4950640 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
4950641 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
4950642 i have no quarrel with mr jinnahs two nation theory it is a historical fact that hindus and muslims are two nations
4950643 his savarkars doctrine was hindutva the doctrine of hindu racial supremacy and his dream was of rebuilding a great hindu empire from the sources of the indus to those of the brahmaputra he hated muslims there was no place for them in the hindu society he envisioned
4950644 the jhelum valley route was until the partition the easiest route from the punjab to kashmir it was also convenient for those who wished to proceed towards attock and peshawar from kashmir it also must have been used for kashmirs trade with persia and western turkistan hiuen tsiang and entered kashmir from the west by this route and it is by this route that many learned scholars and sufis from persia and turkistan came to the valley
4950645 we would see the red army in ladakh the green army in the valley and the saffron army in jammu

4950649 we werent looking for stories of people who were stranded and abandoned by the storm
4950650 but kimberly and scott were such incredible storytellers we went down there determined to tell a personal story but we did it with an unexpected subject
4950651 i was just trying to survive and help the people who were with us
4950652 i look at it now and im terrified when we got into the attic the battery ran out so i wrapped the camera up in a garbage bag so people would know how we died if they found the camera
4950653 the first time i saw the finished film i went into labor
4950654 i was very moved seeing myself on the big screen keeping it real
4950655 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4950656 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4950657 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4950658 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4950659 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4950660 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
4950661 allora immagina che durante il giorno hai bevuto troppo latte alla fragola la notte ti svegli perch devi andare in bagno ti accorgi per che fuori dalle coperte fa freddo e non ti va di uscire dal letto dopo un po hai un bisogno di urinare insopportabile agonia ansia dilemma il momento si fa impellente cos decidi di andare in bagno sei in piedi davanti alla tazza tiri fuori spari ti senti liberato per un istante pensi che si viva solo per un momento come questo ma poi ti rendi conto che non sei in bagno hai solo sognato sei ancora dentro al letto tra le gambe si allarga la sensazione di qualcosa di caldo per non puoi fermarti non ce la fai eccola qui questa la verit questo che significa essere un bevitore di latte alla fragola capito
4950662 we have been a catalyst to help get artists signed

4950669 ive had the fortune of actually standing in the middle of the sports area in the stadium and its an amazing feeling a little bit akin to the millennium stadium you get that real buzz about it
4950670 i understand its a very good stadium for competing in so hopefully well see some records falling which will be great
4950671 the building is very special and its great that the name the birds nest has been adopted around the world its a fantastic design
4950672 it is very iconic for the chinese the olympics is the coming out party as everybody uses that phrase for china
4950673 the focus of that and the way its projected throughout the world is through that image of the birds nest
4950674 its very important for beijing firstly as a city but also for all chinese everywhere and i think not just in china all chinese all over the world are very proud that china has a world class stadium
4950675 she takes me to hospital and to see the doctor it would be impossible for me to get to these places if she didnt take me and i really appreciate that
4950676 i go to the gym for a couple of hours once a week
4950677 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
4950678 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
4950679 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
4950680 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
4950681 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
4950682 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society
4950683 many older people experience loneliness but men over the age of 80 who live alone as well as those who are recently bereaved are particularly at risk
4950684 i never did much around the house mainly a bit of hoovering and washing the car it was quite a challenge at first but i can do it all now
4950685 my wife who had to go out to work because we didnt have much money did all the washing cooking and cleaning as well like all blokes do i took that for granted only now do i appreciate the work she did
4950686 but im always glad when they have time for a chat
4950687 but now and then i do think wouldnt it be nice to walk into the kitchen and have a nice cup of tea waiting for me but no if i want one ill have to get it myself
4950688 in this type of environment the cream rises to the top

4950690 if we get all the international players from australia playing twenty20 and possibly a marquee player as well itll definitely be a massive hit for australian cricket

4950700 similarities between the two killings valentins murder and my daughters especially when it comes to the knife blows
4950701 he is a nice boy but sometimes he lives in another world
4950702 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence

4950706 everyone i know wanted tickets we chinese love to see sports
4950707 its a pity there are so many empty seats we would like to know who is responsible
4950708 this is our fourth olympics but getting tickets to this one really has been a nightmare
4950709 then you get inside and you wonder who got all the tickets because there is nobody there
4950710 all the tickets have been sold out we will be encouraging all the ticket holders to watch the matches themselves
4950711 if they dont want to go they should give the tickets to those who do
4950712 i know where our seats are the people who bought our tickets are attending
4950713 we havent beaten cinco ranch since ive been here so this means a lot
4950714 we had a lot of people step up off the bench i was very pleased

4950730 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4950731 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4950732 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4950733 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4950734 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4950735 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4950736 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4950737 what we can do for these children now we are their mothers and fathers
4950738 i had a first class community and village to bring me up everything a child could dream of i had it
4950739 people rarely died the first one i knew i was 18
4950740 i love the face of poverty darling poverty live with me forever
4950741 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country
4950742 its been promising enough that were going to amp up our discussions with other labels to grow the catalogue
4950743 we definitely expect a slowdown in the growth of the tv market
4950744 if you compete in the low end you end up damaging your brand and your profitability
4950745 because of the economic slowdown the chinese market has been very difficult
4950746 always make time for the people who really matter my friends and family because life wouldnt be much fun without them

4950751 i dont take insulin or any type of diabetic medication the diabetes is totally under control because i can exercise now
4950752 certainly we found that some of the rise in the surgery can be attributed to the increasing population prevalence of obesity
4950753 there are other likely factors though things like increasing publicity and awareness of the surgery
4950754 there was relatively few complications recorded and very little difference in survival outcomes between the bariatric surgery patients and the general population
4950755 certainly there have been improvements in this sort of surgery over that period of time
4950756 laparoscopic surgery is now available it is safer it is a more realistic option
4950757 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundrerdth of a second to finishing if off with a world record its an amazing experience
4950758 im just really relieved to get back safe and sound after the ordeal up there
4950759 and im just glad its all over and im looking forward to sleeping in a bed tonight
4950760 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4950761 these the bombings were definitely terrorist acts as they were carried out by people motivated by an ideology
4950762 the arrests have broken the myth that persons belonging only to a particular community are involved in blasts
4950763 their sphere of activities extends into the hinterland while we do not have evidence to directly link them to the bajrang dal or the vishwa hindu parishad they have protested together on occasions
4950764 gadkari and nikam are full time sevaks for sanatan for the last three years their links with any terror outfit is yet to be established nikam taught gadkari about bomb making and one of the two bombs was manufactured within the premises of sanatan ashram
4950765 every time i come back here its like a pain in my heart
4950766 theres just death everywhere theres not a house here that hasnt been affected
4950767 bajrang dal activists in main satna market reached the jewellery shop of heera soni and asked him to close the shop when he refused they barged into the shop looted some jewellery and beat him up
4950768 the activists also threatened him following which my brother out of fear set himself ablaze the police also beat up my brother so that he does not report the matter to the higher authorities
4950769 the violence was unfortunate and a thorough probe will be conducted the situation in the state is completely under control
4950770 this is a conspiracy to stop the amarnath pilgrimage tomorrow it will be vaishnodevi and tirupati
4950771 two persons have been killed in violence in khajrana area while six others are injured
4950772 the treasurys refusal to provide scotland with the funds to implement the new pension scheme for the police and fire and rescue services is bewildering
4950773 this is a clear cut case of spending rising in england and wales in a devolved area due to a decision taken on a uk wide basis and thus scotland should receive its fair share of extra funding via a barnett consequential
4950774 the police and our fire and rescue services are far too important to be treated in this way by the uk government
4950775 our members deserve better after a lifetime of placing themselves in danger to protect the public
4950776 the funding of pensions is too big a burden for individual police forces
4950777 the snp must face up to their responsibilities in government and implement the new pensions calculations for retiring police officers in scotland
4950778 kenny macaskill must also look seriously at the possibility of funding police pensions centrally from holyrood so that our police forces and local authorities budgets are not stretched beyond their limits by the increased number of retiring officers and increased life expectancy

4950785 consultation is only effective if we successfully sample a group of people that truly represent the whole community
4950786 not everybody has access to the web so we plan to integrate information gathering into everyday policing
4950787 their opinion really does count to us but to make sure it is heard people must be willing to engage with us and take advantage of the opportunities we are providing
4950788 they get all these great speeches where they get to dress people down all these chances for heavy duty dramatics
4950789 new york is really in so many ways the epicenter of the world and the center of all things exciting
4950790 the tunnels and the dark parks and the dark streets add to the atmosphere

4950857 i want to go to the park with the ducks
4950858 ducks are cool besides i want to go on the bridge mom bought bread so we can feed the ducks
4950859 i want to go to the big park with the cool playground
4950860 yeah thats the one i am talking about naked people park with all the playgrounds mom can we go to naked people park
4950861 yes we are going to the naked people park but only if you clean up your mess first
4950862 ze hebben het geld niet meer nodig dit jaar als een film het in de zomer z ontzettend veel beter doet dan verwacht als in het geval van the dark knight dan hoef je echt niet harry potter er nog achteraan te hebben in de herfst
4950863 ze mochten geen chocolade eten totdat ze die medaille in handen hadden
4950864 zij hebben drie jaar keihard geknokt om deze plak te behalen
4950865 i think its a bit exaggerated to use that word
4950866 the signs are not really very good for the future
4950867 kannst du selbst bei solch einem ereignis nicht mal die klappe von fu ball halten
4950868 epa is cannibalizing its children and public health functions in order to run programs that should be paid for by the department of homeland security an organization not suffering from a lack of funding
4950869 we do not need epa researchers playing junior g men
4950870 it is unconscionable that epa is certifying pesticides as safe without doing the basic research to determine their effects on growing children
4950871 view recent elimination of the office of childrens health protection and creation of new national security and intelligence office

4950873 when you play so nicely like this i think you deserve a big hug special treat extra privilege
4950874 if you dont settle down ill have to ask you to leave the room and return when you can stay here quietly
4950875 was it your suit or the fact that you had to get up so early or maybe its the air
4950876 bob im sure he was thinking about his nana when he made that flip turn on the third lap
4950877 we were still at university and didnt have a place to showcase our talent we were trading in something new on the scene we started out by doing short comic plays and after talking to the proprietor of club tlc we would perform and at the end of the night be paid with a plate of chips each
4950878 eventually we began sending out flyers within makerere but most of the
4950879 people still didnt come we had to cut the entrance fee to shs2 000 for the first time we got a crowd of 50 thats when we resorted to word of mouth as our new marketing strategy
4950880 so we thought they would come around laugh their stress off and face friday fresh
4950881 we couldnt stay at tlc so we walked away in protest however our fans were used to watching comedy in a bar setting and it took us three months to find a perfect venue we found one at national theatre and had to build a new audience
4950882 being on t v has added much value to our work and as soon as our skits started airing corporate companies began calling to negotiate a deal though it was too late
4950883 women cant handle him so he thinks he will always be single
4950884 you know i really prefer not to continue this conversation any longer lets change the subject
4950885 the same problem that your still having attitude and some men dont like it
4950886 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
4950887 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
4950888 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
4950889 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear

4950902 from an outsiders perspective it looked like the offense struggled a little bit today
4950903 i dont know how many points we averaged last year
4950904 but if we practice the way we did today well be on that same path were trying to avoid that certainly
4950905 it was really one of the better scrimmages weve had offensively in quite some time and im going back months and months and months
4950906 that leaves a lot of wiggle room right now a lot of possibilities should be exciting to everybody and im not sure it is so thats a little bit of a concern
4950907 a lot of things are open right now and wed like to have been a little further along in the evaluation process at this point
4950908 ill add to it thank goodness were not playing tomorrow
4950909 i dont know who we could schedule that we could compete with right now

4950911 prima ci hanno bombardato dal cielo allalba sono arrivati anche i carri armati
4950912 perch i nostri generali non si fidano del presidente georgiano saakahvili quindi stiamo andando a difendere i nostri amici ossetini
4950913 alle 23 45 del 7 agosto scorso le forze georgiane hanno attaccato la capitale dellossezia del sud con lanciarazzi a testata multipla e bombardato la citt fino alle 9 del mattino seguente la mia chiesa andata distrutta sotto le macerie sono morte decine di fedeli che credevano di avervi trovato rifugio
4950914 non ho voluto benedire le salme dei soldati georgiani uccisi in ossezia perch sono cristiani che hanno trucidato altri cristiani
4950915 saakashvili ha giustificato il bombardamento sui civili sostenendo che voleva ristabilire lordine costituzionale ma l il novanta per cento degli abitanti da anni chiede di potersi distaccare da tbilisi
4950916 quando sono cadute le prime bombe mi sono nascosta nel rifugio del mio condominio e l sono rimasta per due giorni poi i georgiani hanno cominciato a spararci contro e sono dovuta fuggire anchio sotto i colpi di mortaio sono morti mio padre e mio marito
4950917 i georgiani hanno prima bombardato dal cielo poi alle prime luci dellalba hanno fatto intervenire i carri armati hanno allora circondato la citt e cominciato a sparare da ogni parte senza risparmiare nulla quando sono scappata ho visto cadaveri ovunque
4950918 l8 mattina una maestra elementare era riuscita a convincere lautista del pullman della scuola a fare il solito giro per recuperare gli alunni e farli fuggire verso lossezia del nord una volta raccolto lultimo piccolo il pulmino stato centrato da un razzo deliberatamente sono morti tutti
4950919 ho visto raramente ferite di guerra cos profonde e devastanti soprattutto in cos tanti pazienti sono tutti gravi gravissimi con amputazioni importanti e ustioni di secondo o terzo grado non so proprio che tipo di proiettili siano stati usati
4950920 somebody has got to step up and do it thats what were waiting to see right now
4950921 as a staff were going to have to make some decisions here in the next five or six days so the clock is running
4950922 out of our top 46 47 guys probably a third of them i could put in ink where theyre going to be
4950923 that leaves a lot of wiggle room right now a lot of possibilities
4950924 it should be exciting to everybody but im not sure it is thats a little bit of a concern
4950925 are you sure you want to send useless file to the recycle bin

4950929 any little glitch can inhibit your punt from your steps to your drop just everything
4950930 every game early in the season i seemed to have some little glitch going on and it was frustrating but i think i got that all worked out
4950931 daniel murray showed me an awful lot up at wisconsin last year
4950932 consistency wise we havent seen it and didnt see it in the spring but to do what he did up there and nobody said much about it because we lost the game he really showed me some substance
4950933 our kickoff return it hasnt helped us at all it seems like since 2002
4950934 i know im exaggerating but we need to get that back thats an important thing
4950935 really i wasnt even kicking the ball that hard i wasnt trying to kick it that hard i was just using my technique and the ball started to fly once i got consistent with it everything improved
4950936 im out here to support my fellow las vegas nevada politics industry workers and also because i feel all of us deserve benefits much like the ceo moselle schreyer and other executive level management share

4950942 ronnie drew passed away peacefully at 2pm today after a long illness with his family by his side the family would like to express their gratitude to
4950943 the family are very grateful for all the letters of support and good wishes during ronnies illness details of funeral arrangements will be announced in due course
4950944 death scares me but we all have a certain amount of time to live we all have to go some time its a killer disease and i dont know if i can beat it or not
4950945 it is with great sadness that i have learned of the death of ronnie drew
4950946 ronnie was a champion of traditional irish music and with the dubliners he re energised and refreshened our
4950947 ronnie will be greatly missed by many but most particularly by his family with whom our thoughts are today
4950948 he bore his final illness with great courage and great dignity he was a great source of humour and good cheer to other patients on the unit
4950949 he will be sadly missed as will his late wife
4950950 weddings funerals barmitzvahs thats what i loved about ronnie drews voice and spirit music to inspire to console an optimism that was contagious thats what u2 took from the dubliners
4950951 ronnie has left his earthly tour for one of the heavens they need him up there its a little too quiet and pious god is lonely for a voice louder than his own
4950952 a truly great man a great performer a great father and a great actor funnily enough although few would remember his performance in richards cork leg
4950953 it was 25 years ago they were down on their luck they came on the late late show to tell their story and we gave them the entire show from beginning to end
4950954 it is one of the classic messages of all time
4950955 ever since then we remained very good friends he was always in good form and he was one of those people you always left smiling
4950956 he was the brightest of the lot of them ronnie gave the impression most of the time as the wisecracking guy but in fact if anyone was asked to give a lecture on literature he would be the one who would do it best
4950957 he was a deep guy he worked things out for himself his wife deirdre was fantastic he wouldnt have gone beyond 50 if it wasnt for her
4950958 i think he kind of knew himself that it was getting closer
4950959 in his last days he made extraordinary efforts to be at different places to go to other peoples concerts and support them he worked very successfully through what i have considered a very difficult time of his life he was brave and noble in pursuit of his art in the end
4950960 i said to my wife when i saw ronnie that he wouldnt last long he couldnt really cope without her when ronnie was on the drink playing throughout
4950961 to me he was a pal for close on 40 years
4950962 but he was also of the old school i had dinner in my house last year for ronnie and a whole bunch of us from the old days and he was telling some bawdy story when geraldine my wife came into the room to see if we were all right and he stopped dead he was like that he wouldnt use bad language in front of a woman
4950963 his unique singing voice was loved by so many people

4950970 but this year hes added the ability to drive and pull up and take a jump shot
4950971 we might have a parade or a big party or something like that
4950972 what he has is very similar to what former iowa quarterback jason manson had a couple years ago
4950973 its pretty predictable he should be back here in two three weeks somewhere in that ballpark thats the good news i guess
4950974 it seems like weve got more guys out than in right now i feel like were back in spring back where we had more guys on the sideline than on the field thats discouraging
4950975 i think ive seen jordans picture on a milk carton
4950976 i havent seen much of him out here its frustrating that he hasnt been able to work hes missed a lot of practice time i havent seen him tackle very much yet so thats a concern
4950977 today was less than encouraging probably what all this means is we need this next week to get better

4950981 most people dont want to move to the sticker system when we first moved to concise it puzzled me and i was not sure how it would work but now it really frustrates me that i have to pay the amount that i do in leysin and cant do anything about it so why should i sort the rubbish there for recycling if we could pay per throw in leysin we would feel the benefits
4950982 its good to just get out with the kids and be able to get close to the players
4950983 im a big hawkeye fan so the boys are too
4950984 definitely doing a lot better making it back to a bowl game
4950985 i think they definitely are doing better in that they had a young line last year and itll hopefully improve
4950986 quarterback jake christensens been looking a lot better and the receivers have been looking good been looking real crisp defensive has been looking great
4950987 i cant really think of anything that i didnt like
4950988 seeing them plough through and sometimes getting their butts kicked too

4950993 i got a little nervous after that first dive where i was placing and stuff
4950994 i just used that nervousness and adrenaline for my next dives and it seemed to help

4951003 i find that the customer can get more value for their money with linux
4951004 since linux provides many possible platforms customizations database options and programming language compatibilities
4951005 they are by far more skilled and less expensive than hiring a specialty in house staff for a online gaming project as a result we just need a couple in house designers to help maintain the website after it is built and take care of odd jobs
4951006 also dont rule out the importance of your database language
4951007 we find that mysql works best in most all cases and provides the flexibility and reliability that we need for our intensive website creations
4951008 because the webmaster sees the site everyday but the customer only sees it once or twice
4951009 while gradients and various hues and tones look cool on screen they dont reproduce well on a mug letterhead or stationary
4951010 i like to keep all pages to w3c html standards so that crawling by robots and human use is as errorless as possible
4951011 i triple check and test all our online gaming website code many times before we launch a beta version for the marketing team to check the more people that test the website before the publish date the better since this is a great way to find any bugs that might throw a wrench in the works
4951012 online gaming website menus are best kept simple and in a constant location on your website so customers can easily navigate your pages
4951013 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
4951014 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
4951015 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
4951016 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
4951017 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
4951018 it came down to the point where the judge made a very bold decision a very drastic move but it was one that needed to be made
4951019 its in our criminal justice system that everyone is innocent until theyre proven guilty but in all reality until you actually are proven your innocence you carry the scarlet letter of the accused

4951022 obviously its an honor to be a part of this and its the biggest sporting event in the world its a lot of fun its a great time
4951023 but at the same time you see what goes on here today our third straight one run loss its definitely tough
4951024 somebody comes out maybe once or twice a day to empty the money but we havent managed to catch them yet there was a lot of money in the machines so they must have made a fortune
4951025 puffer fish teeth can grow back but henrys was snapped off beyond the point where it would grow we had to cut the rest of the tooth they are both big fish but we werent expecting any trouble the tank theyre in is very big but we think clyde has grown too big now
4951026 we have relocated him to an aquarium in germany henry doesnt seem to be any the worse for wear even though he has lost one of his four teeth
4951027 we are taking a very conservative view of which technology we will use for the first plant but we are open to using fresnel or solar towers or even photovoltaics for subsequent ones as soon as those are well proven like parabolic troughs are he said
4951028 shareholders of worleyparsons and the other listed companies in the team ought to be asking why ausras product which is likely to be 25 per cent cheaper than parabolic trough plants has been overlooked again
4951029 a solar power plant isnt going to blow up in an explosion in the way some mining assets do he said
4951030 there are always going to be knockers and detractors who say there are better technologies available than the one we have chosen mr meurs said
4951031 i say get them going get them to a stage where they are proven in the field that would be wonderful and something we would be interested in looking at
4951032 extrapolating from the power station ausra is about to start building it would cost about 250 million less to build a fresnel solar park the same size as worleyparsons is planning he said
4951033 the jackals are already sniffing at our body assuming its a corpse seeking to take whatever they can find to build their own schools were not dead yet at least wait until the corpse is cold
4951034 senator obama offers us the leadership needed to address the challenges guam and our nation will face in the coming years
4951035 its just brought an overwhelming amount of possibilities into the classroom
4951036 it really enables a classroom to go very quickly from powerpoint presentation with notes about the civil war to suddenly go to pictures from the library of congress
4951037 i want him to have us dreaming and thinking whats next
4951038 we want the students so involved that when its time to go home they are like what happened to the day thats engaged
4951039 it the withdrawal has not started yet the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilised
4951040 the disputed territories of south ossetia and abkhazia are georgian and that this is not something which is up for negotiation
4951041 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4951042 i do believe that its obvious that alabama lacked a oneness of purpose
4951043 thats really something that bryant tried to instill in us then you can depend on the guy next to you
4951044 we were excited it was like a rainbow after the storm
4951045 when bryant talked it was like listening a symphony orchestra after listening to a hard rock band
4951046 then youd wake up and your roommate would be gone sometimes you could hear the foot lockers click click clicking down the stairs
4951047 and he got the best out of you or the worst
4951048 i owe a lot of what i accomplished in my life to him
4951049 same thing though i thought they gave up a couple of big plays and thats always something you always want to guard against
4951050 there was a high difference with some of the young players from last week to this week thats going to be helpful to us from a depth standpoint
4951051 we have a bit of a long jam at running back and were a little thin at linebacker
4951052 we just talked to him yesterday about it well see how it goes at linebacker for a few days
4951053 we scrimmaged him out there some plays today probably didnt know what to do but he went up and tackled the guy with the ball quite a bit i did notice that well see how he develops and thats just kind of a trial right now
4951054 when you give up any big plays it kind of disturbs you
4951055 i think well be a faster unit you definitely see a difference in the guys and the attitude on the field in getting more guys to the ball
4951056 you wont see many times in which just one guy makes a tackle its your going to see a lot more guys swarming to the ball because thats something theyre emphasizing every day
4951057 they throw a deep ball and they want the defensive linemen to take off running you never know anything could happen fumble anything
4951058 he has made a significant improvement in weight management discipline
4951059 hes in the 365 range i think we wanted him at 366 365 i dont know that hes going to be able to lose a whole lot more weight than that right now its his conditioning and his ability to sustain
4951060 hes a presence in the middle and pushes the pocket hes difficult to block hes made a contribution to the defense in the middle theres no question about that especially on run downs
4951061 if we compare what abu mazen abbas will get in two weeks what hizbullah got looks miniscule
4951062 making a good middle east e gaming development brand is absolutely key
4951063 but im proud i was able to be part of such a distinguished research team
4951064 because it allows the entire general public to learn about things they never before furthermore it may even convince them to go out and buy the professors book
4951065 im happy prof boward shuffstall invited me to join the team
4951066 and this will be a great highlight for my resume as i look for employment after college
4951067 its a tough world out there for employment within the middle east e gaming development sector
4951068 so i invited strong students to help me in this project hopefully this experience will help them gain meaningful employment later on
4951069 ive been working within the middle east e gaming development field for years and never before have i seen better work out of prof poehlein lisowski
4951070 basically were looking at new ideas within the middle east e gaming development realm of thought that have never really been put in writing before
4951071 and this is what makes the release such an exciting event for our community new ideas means new developments and success for our area
4951072 well be releasing the final version of our middle east e gaming development study this evening
4951073 which will make the twilight hours at the local book shops very interesting
4951074 but only because of the high expectations and standards of our middle east e gaming development project we have worked tirelessly for about a year now and we hope to release the best review of middle east e gaming development thought in decades
4951075 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4951076 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4951077 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4951078 its already been examined by the accc australian competition and consumer commission but i have to take advice from apra australian prudential regulation authority and i have to take into account national interest considerations
4951079 i accept that i have a decision to take because its market sensitive i dont speculate about the outcome of that decision
4951080 but we have our eye on financial stability in the system as well as the competitive nature of the system when i take that decision about national interest considerations
4951081 we did that because of concerns about financial stability in the system not just in terms of competition
4951082 which just underscores the fact that our funding costs were higher than what we actually recovered
4951083 were a few basis points behind at this point so obviously were looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4951084 its going to be an interesting situation to see exactly where our funding position is at that point
4951085 i think its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
4951086 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down
4951087 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4951088 so in the longer term if those rates continue to come down then the banks should be passing on those benefits as well when it comes to their unofficial cash rate rises that occurred over the last few months

4951091 i pass six starbucks every morning on my walk to work just to clarify thats counting only the starbucks that are actually on the west side of eighth avenue in midtown manhattan i think there are some branches on the east side but that side remains terra incognita for me for most new yorkers micro optimizing the walk to work is a matter of habit and i have no reason to cross the street for all i know the other side of eighth avenue consists of nothing but pachinko parlors and flea circuses wouldnt surprise me one bit
4951092 we lost some time because a deal to expand at our current location fell through it turned out that the extra floor we wanted wasnt actually to use the real estate jargon available

4951099 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4951100 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4951101 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

4951103 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4951104 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up

4951172 exposure to violent video games even e rated video games increases aggressive thoughts increases pro social behavior and increases general arousal
4951173 the more normal it is the more likely it is theyre going to activate or engage in those behaviors when provoked or even unprovoked
4951174 with a shooting game you cant actually go out and shoot someone
4951175 the whole thing with video games is do something you cant already do in real life at least thats what it is to me
4951176 just like any new media it gets attacked when any new genre of music comes out it gets attacked tv will of course get attacked im sure way back when books got attacked

4951183 i think its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
4951184 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down
4951185 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well

4951190 i wanted to stay all the way with the leading pack but found that halfway through i just couldnt keep up
4951191 there is a huge difference in level between myself and the worlds top runners

4951202 i accept that i have a decision to take because its market sensitive i dont speculate about the outcome of that decision
4951203 but we have our eye on financial stability in the system as well as the competitive nature of the system when i take that decision about national interest considerations

4951215 water availability in irrigated agriculture areas like the murray valley is extremely low this has a cumulative effect affecting prices from the farm gate to the checkout

4951304 under this government there has been no effort to promote oral hygiene beyond what the toothpaste companies have done

4951306 government funding for health research in this country is less than a third than that of australia per capita
4951307 its severe only 15 percent were funded this year for hrc and i have colleagues that have had stellar results in their reviews and nothing its killing them
4951308 i think there has been shock at the size of the gap
4951309 i dont believe in wellington there has been an appreciation of how far behind health funding research funding is
4951310 here at the malaghan institute were really desperate for funding
4951311 its the only job we do here health research into diseases if we dont get funding that job stops

4951318 he employs other people and he works with us in our road safety campaigns
4951319 it looks like a costume a waterlogged costume thats been stuffed into a freezer
4951320 it just doesnt have the hallmark of a real corpse
4951321 the story of his paper has some interesting twists and turns that are important because they bear on the relation of progress in science and scientific publication
4951322 in a book published in 1885 by nageli and peter entitled die hieracien mitteleuropas mendels paper is cited out of context lumped with his other inheritance paper on hieracien
4951323 mendels published paper was distributed to about 120 libraries throughout the world through the exchange list of the brunn society and was available in england and the united states the paper was listed in the royal society england catalogue of scientific papers for 1866 and referred to without comment in a paper on beans by h hoffmann in 1869 the only substantial reference was in the 590 page treatise on plant hybrids by w o focke in 1881 mendels name is mentioned 17 times but it is clear that focke did not understand mendel
4951324 mendels published paper was distributed to about 120 libraries throughout the world through the exchange list of the brunn society and was available in england and the united states

4951328 not enforcing the changes until 2012 is a smart move as it allows employers some time to phase in the reforms but more action is needed to improve employer awareness so that businesses are not caught out
4951329 the formal process isnt yet completed when the requirements are met then it will be carried out
4951330 maybe you should actually try using gnome for a month or so instead of keep repeating your often wrong assumptions you know what last night i put my money where my mouth is i did something better than any gnome user has apparently ever done i actually wrote the code to fix the thing

4951332 the only reason we took this e gaming photographic images case to court was so we might avoid having to pay settlement fees now however we will be paying out to the plaintiffs though no more than our risk team originally budgeted

4951335 with students working hard on their e gaming photographic images law mid term exams ive been able to assist the fulton wrighton and stirling bivin law team in the recent e gaming photographic images class action case this is proving to be a very good experience for me and it will dynamically boost the breadth of my curicular offerings as my pre law department advances
4951336 the judge has a great law pedigree and this will allow us greater scope when the e gaming photographic images case is argued
4951337 im excited to be litigating this e gaming photographic images case with my colleague wittner dudas a distinguished attorney with more than 25 years experience
4951338 and we firmly believe that the e gaming photographic images case we have prepared for the 3 judge tribunal is rock solid
4951339 which probably means that well win this case handily the case put forth by my boss cotnoir cepero was so convincing that we believe the jury will only be out for a couple days before they render their decision
4951340 were working closely with the lead partners at the soong quattrini and delcie urps law firm to develop our new e gaming photographic images law curriculum
4951341 in hopes to provide real world insight for our studies that will prepare students adequately for the future
4951342 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
4951343 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
4951344 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work

4951347 through the storm a real story of fame and family in a tabloid world
4951348 weve rarely seen physicians so agonized over a topic as this
4951349 if you want to keep asking me over and over again youre welcome to
4951350 i dont know how much time we have you keep asking me the same question
4951351 there is nothing thats off the table i dont want tax increases but that doesnt mean that anything is off the table
4951352 ive been involved in washington in many negotiations on issues whether it be immigration or campaign finance reform or issues before the commerce committee
4951353 my position is that im against increased taxes and my record shows that i have opposed tax increases and been in favor of tax cuts
4951354 i am going in with a position and i know how to negotiate
4951355 weve got to sit down across the table republican and democrat we know how these things are done we say ok weve got to negotiate weve got to put the american people first and our party second
4951356 we will negotiate and you have to negotiate in good faith
4951357 it may have to be phased in with new employees
4951358 for a long time this risk management fund had a surplus that covered where that loss was
4951359 it isnt pretty it isnt painless but i assure you if you stick to the plan you will go from a to z
4951360 we cant report on it and be confident or comfortable that what we are providing is reliable
4951361 were making sure weve done all the right things to shore up our decision making process
4951362 there are plenty of new residential ghost towns in the west in places like nevada california arizona
4951363 why would anyone want to build new shopping strips malls hotels and offices in such ghost towns
4951364 its not like they dont know whats going on out there
4951365 if i got the right price i might go out and buy residential mortgage backed securities
4951366 estoy furioso ellos nunca me preguntaron sobre una secuela con el joker s como hay que hacerlo y nadie me ha preguntado nada
4951367 because i want people to understand what i say and i want them to understand deaf culture
4951368 i dont want people to think that deaf people are stupid and i want to understand hearing people better
4951369 it can get lonesome in niagara falls if you dont have enough people to talk to
4951370 jack and i always wanted to adopted a deaf child
4951371 there were 100 families that wanted jena and we think were very lucky to have her
4951372 the whole idea was to get as many people in the community as possible to communicate with jena
4951373 her dad and i feel her speech and reading skills have improved greatly from being in regular school classes
4951374 we cant say enough about the falls school district and what theyve done for jena
4951375 if i have time i read my friends lips or write notes
4951376 some people think because deaf people can hear sounds we should be able to understand them
4951377 i can hear many sounds but the sounds are not in the normal speech range
4951378 im around jena a lot and i want to know what shes saying
4951379 im worried that if i dont have the support im worried about a relapse
4951380 i love my family i love my life i need to be a role model for my children
4951381 i need them to say we have a good fun father whos involved in our life i dont want to be that drunk that my kids know its a fear and my prediction is if it continues on the path that it has been going that it might go down that road
4951382 i have a lot of support but i need that aa meeting
4951383 when youre deaf you have less exposure to general public things
4951384 it worked for me it helped me realize the error of my ways it got me into aa they had interpreting services there and i learned a lot of what i didnt know
4951385 and i was so surprised because i worked at the new england homes for the deaf which is a nursing home for deaf elders for several years and i expected to see an old deaf man
4951386 it was like oh i get to go hang out with craig for a little bit
4951387 and then somehow i dont even remember how one time he came fishing with us because i used to take my kids fishing all the time when they were little it was really fun to have someone to talk to while they fished
4951388 theres been no funding for a year now and he doesnt go to aa meetings unless im going to go or unless we have friends who are interpreters who have volunteered to interpret
4951389 people have been nice but its occasional people are busy im busy and hes my husband
4951390 and everybody points the finger at everybody else and eventually they point the finger at us
4951391 people assume that because were the deaf agency we should be able to solve deaf problems
4951392 there isnt any case law on it as far as were aware
4951393 sometimes an agency will take care of the expense whatever arrangements are made should be based on a group conscience decision arrived at after full discussion at a business meeting
4951394 as deaf members rely on these services and there should be stability in whether the meeting is interpreted or not
4951395 but we have to understand what its going to cost us
4951396 i feel almost embarrassed that its such a problem that i need to have this service that i need to have this interview get involved with this part of my life
4951397 a lot of people are in aa and other people dont know about it
4951398 i have a new daughter and a new wife and we have a new life up here in new hampshire ive been reunited with my two children from my previous relationship
4951399 senator mccain and the republicans mock democratic candidate for president barack obama for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tire inflation
4951400 not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4951401 i love my block i love the people around here everyone knows each other so its hard for me to move out and start my life somewhere else its a tough neighborhood but im good im set here
4951402 the money hasnt gotten to my head the articles in the paper nothing has gone to my head my life has changed now boxing is my job but i havent changed
4951403 she hasnt quite got it right but it is clear that is what she means
4951404 she first did it on friday we thought she was waving her hands around and thought it was a coincidence that she was hungry
4951405 but other people have spotted it my older daughter saw her doing it too
4951406 we are really proud of her the first time it could have been a coincidence but she does it when she is hungry
4951407 british sign language is ivys mums natural language and she has to be able to talk to her mum
4951408 we always use sign language around her and i speak to her too
4951409 it can take up to a year for babies to say their first words and it is known they can use their hands to communicate before they speak because their vocal cords havent been devel oped yet
4951410 sign language is really important for deaf children and children with deaf family members because it enables them to comm unicate
4951411 we looked up on the internet when babies can start signing from and the earliest we have found is three to four months old
4951412 i think it will make communication better in general in families i think it will make learning sign language a lot easier for people
4951413 the idea is that you should be able to produce a sign in front of a web cam and the computer will recognize based on the visual properties of what youve just done what sign it is that you produced
4951414 im very thankful i can still maintain my home and get around i have wonderful and helpful friends
4951415 it was sheer joy to listen to them recall stories of their school years and they all had such respect and admiration for their teachers and classmates
4951416 alice akers is a very special person and was a member of an amazing class of fhs
4951417 the children were so happy because they could communicate with other children what a salvation
4951418 for the little ones students id write a card to the parents to say dont worry and how their childs first night went so they knew everything was alright
4951419 i saved it and while it is in the museum now it served me at home for years as a hot plate
4951420 she has been an inspiration to me because of her strong faith and values
4951421 she cares so much about other people and has such a strong commitment to her family shes a remarkable woman
4951422 patients who have been deaf in both ears for many years often do not achieve the same level of performance as those who have short term deafness and receive a cochlear implant
4951423 this patient had long term deafness in one ear and a short term deafness in the other i anticipated that having hearing in one ear for most of her life would improve her outcome with the implant in the long term deaf ear but there hadnt been enough studies to know for sure
4951424 were using imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to look at how different types of sounds are coded in the auditory system
4951425 when sound input from one ear changes we expect to see some reorganization of activity in the auditory cortex
4951426 he is determined he will not give up he is a fighter and hes very confident
4951427 he has more of a drive than most other kids
4951428 hes just an animal theres no other way to put it
4951429 the next thing i knew they told me he was profoundly deaf
4951430 it was a shock it was overwhelming at about 12 or 15 months he just started not talking as much or repeating
4951431 here i was sending a 2 year old off with a backpack and he had a smile on his face and he couldnt wait
4951432 i decided then that it makes me stronger smarter and more confident to go outside and experience the outside world
4951433 immediately we could tell how strong he was because as an 8th grader he was as tall as i am
4951434 hes developed his muscle and build and as a coach i saw great potential
4951435 whats it like being on the swim team do they treat you special or are you just one of the guys
4951436 except sometimes they tease me and i tease them back
4951437 its not that big a deal we treat him like a regular kid pretty much we make fun of him like everyone else hes just one of the guys thats pretty much it
4951438 you would hear the gun and everyone else would go and hed be the last one in the water
4951439 before i got my light i was frustrated because i couldnt get a good start
4951440 then i got my light and it helped me be much better because as soon as i got the start i could get my best time
4951441 he doesnt want you to know that hes deaf he doesnt want you to give him any special treatment and the kids dont ya know kids are very honest and theyve accepted that and theyve accepted him
4951442 the fact that shes so successful in the things shes doing like school and latin club is just amazing
4951443 i did a colored pencil drawing prior to the convention and entered it there at the convention itself i took a mythology test and placed 25th and also took up a written essay contest and placed ninth
4951444 i do love learning languages but i think latin is a special one
4951445 since i took up latin i start to notice how latin is connected to a lot of other languages
4951446 it would be so easy for these kids to get discounted it happens all the time everywhere look what happens when special services supports a kid who wanted to compete in this competition like all the other high school kids
4951447 i always tell people that is was like everything was in black and white
4951448 then when i got my hearing aid my world became color i could hear music for the first time your world changes when you can hear sound
4951449 books alone today are very expensive those who wanted to be considered had to submit a one page essay on how hearing aids had affected their lives it couldve been about how they had affected you or someone close to you like a grandparent we didnt want to make this hard
4951450 we had a lot of nice essays and some great stories but pam was just the unanimous choice pam has gone through a lot and it was more about her life and how poorly she was treated in school until they realized she had a hearing loss
4951451 it was amazing how all three judges went the same way
4951452 i think its because the classes are all visual and i respond better to online courses i never expected to win the 500 scholarship at the center they were able to convert it to a gift card because i do a lot of printing with online courses and ink is very expensive plus i needed to buy a scientific calculator so i was very grateful to get that
4951453 these studies will provide the first look at how social motivational language and cognitive abilities of deaf children influence their development of maths abilities
4951454 with this knowledge we should be able to develop instructional strategies that take advantage of students strengths while accommodating their needs
4951455 technically powerful but not as elegant as apples iphone and os x
4951456 google will be competing against other operating system licensers such as symbian and microsoft for design wins around the world
4951457 your logic is flawed for one if it was 40 of the market that is 40 that is very much up for grabs because there is no guarantee that after that current handset becomes outdated in about 2 3 years time theres no guarantee that person may buy another nokia
4951458 yes i have heard all about these symbian phones i want one
4951459 but the real fact of the matter is there is no guarantee

4951463 its been such an unbelievable ride with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it took was a little imagination
4951464 i dont know what to feel right now its so emotional all i want to do is go see my mom
4951465 to be honest i was thinking not to blow the lead
4951466 i was really nervous going into this race i just wanted to take it out as hard as i could and hold on as strong as i could
4951467 without the help of my relay teammates this isnt possible
4951468 phelegmatic mask is often the result of someone who gives up on life and becomes apathetic deciding its easier to mouth agreeable words than to fight for whats right cholerics who cant win in a given situation may put on a phlegmatic mask of peace and pretend they dont care melancholies who sense no one cares just wont bother to even communicate any more
4951469 its all your fault lar i told you not to sit on the cushion already you dont want to listen see now the table spoil already
4951470 yes everything is your fault otherwise is my fault meh
4951471 sitting on the cushion has got nothing to do with the table tipping over lor and whos the fatter one here your weight must have made the table give way every time you get up the table will shake as if got earthquake liddat
4951472 no i tell you its cos you sat on the cushion and made the table fall see the thing is broken at your side not mine
4951473 how can just one simple cushion make the table give way no lor
4951474 oi you guys the person thats cleaning up after you still havent said anything yet leh

4951496 you are beautiful please light my life make my nightmares leave help me find love once more
4951497 we know from some of hitchs biographies that he wasnt averse to dressing up as woman for the amusement of guests at his house
4951498 also one of the central themes of north by northwest is that nobody is who they seem to be
4951499 bobs not cool about the marriage hes mad about it
4951500 hes always been friendly but as youd expect he has what i call a healthy scepticism about me i think any father would if their daughter got married the way we did
4951501 weve spoken on the phone four or five times and that was tough we agreed we need to meet face to face i am planning to get to england as soon as i can and with peaches tell him my feelings im really nervous but peaches reckons its all cool
4951502 im terrified of meeting him face to face but thats going to happen soon its all been arranged
4951503 if all goes well then well go ahead with something much larger
4951504 i studied one of the mummies the larger one back in 1979 and determined the blood group data from this baby mummy and compared it with my 1969 blood grouping of tutankhamun
4951505 the results confirmed that this larger fetus could indeed be the daughter of tutankhamen
4951506 this is a very important project as these fetuses have never been fully studied
4951507 the fetuses might help identify the lineage and the family of king tutankhamun particularly his parents
4951508 since these two fetuses were found in the tomb of tutankhamen there is no reason to think that they were other than his offspring a matter supported by my 1979 blood group studies
4951509 in a way these mice are guiding clinical trials we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
4951510 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
4951511 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last
4951512 i would have walked because it was something that was actually okay walking i havent made the injury worse
4951513 if i felt i was doing some serious damage i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the olympic games so many people have worked so hard to get me here
4951514 in some ways its almost quicker to keep going because if you stop youre just left out there on your own
4951515 they couldnt have been better conditions when i started to struggle i got a lot of traffic and that was annoying i was getting lots of fumes as well as everything else
4951516 it has been raining here for past three months for the last one month we are in a very bad condition many houses have fallen down in the rains people have nowhere to go and nothing to eat
4951517 the rains have caused a lot of destruction in our house we have lost almost all our belongings in the rain water there is nobody to pay any heed to our troubles despite our repeated complaints nobody has come to help us in our predicament
4951518 after a survey we will compensate the villagers for the loss incurred by them due to the rains all possible help will be provided to the people
4951519 wolves consume many prey animals a minimum of 150 200 moose contribute to an isle royale wolfs diet over the course of its lifetime and the prey consume a whole lot of plants
4951520 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
4951521 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
4951522 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
4951523 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
4951524 instrumental measurements of environmental variables are only available for about the past few hundred years so this may help us understand paleo environmental change better and if we can understand ancient environments better then our ability to predict future changes is improved
4951525 the two looked ecstatic and couldnt keep the smiles off their faces or their eyes off each other
4951526 not really you mostly just have to watch for rattlesnakes but they wont really be out at night

4951556 neither one of us knew if the reunion was going to take hold our handlers his camp and my camp were just walking on eggshells they kept us apart so we wouldnt blow the whole deal
4951557 its the lack of success that keeps you together when youre struggling and trying to make it you stay together because youve got nothing else now the reunion comes really because cheech played his string of straight acting gigs out so it was now or never

4951567 this identification by aim and others hasnt been disputed by the media which has desperately tried to ignore the obama davis relationship but the obama campaign has not responded to it until now
4951568 the admission that obamas mentor was frank marshall davis an identified cpusa member can only add to growing public concern about obamas relationship with a communist pawn of moscow who was the subject of security investigations by the fbi and various congressional committees which examined soviet activities in the u s
4951569 it is clear that corsi is to obama what the national enquirer is to admitted adulterer and liar john edwards the enquirer exposed edwards secret life when the rest of the media were refusing to investigate the candidate and making fun of the enquirer

4951595 we were not worried near the finish line by then we were well into a rhythm for the finish we knew they would come back but we put the work in early so we could hold on for the finish and make sure
4951596 before the race we sat down and said we wanted to come here and win this we have worked all this year and last year the last 10 years and it comes down to six and a half minutes or so of hell but with a fantastic result

4951598 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4951599 the elephants and pianos were all on my shoulders my heart was pounding and my stomach gone its a long way if youre feeling like that
4951600 i knew the 36 hours in between would be a race to recover and i did everything i could but in the end it was really telling on me and it caught me out
4951601 the times swam here in beijing were like nothing i have experienced before it was incredibly tough just to qualify for the final
4951602 to qualify for the final i had to swim my best time for four years and im impressed with those guys who clocked those kind of times in the final just 36 hours after a huge hit in qualifying
4951603 normally you can stroll through the heats but i had to swim a world class time just to get through and it took its toll in the back end of that final i tried to kick but the tank was empty
4951604 i tried my best but sadly i did not have the recovery powers
4951605 the event has changed and everybody is going to have to re think their strategies this is now basically a 1500m sprint its unbelievable
4951606 now if i want to carry on in this event for another four years ive got to find a way to do maxed out 1500m in a short space of time if i want to compete
4951607 i would have liked to have gone quicker but ive got to recover for the 10k that will be a different challenge and a tough test and im looking forward to it
4951608 i had expectations for the 400m freestyle but this is a great surprise
4951609 i felt good in the first 400m of this race and at the 800m and 900m i started believing that i could win
4951610 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100m to save my energy and attack in the final 50m
4951611 im not sure im a little older now ill see what i feel like have a break then see what happens
4951612 to get second is great but three in a row would have been nice
4951613 i have certainly no regrets in my preparation and what ive been able to do here it was certainly a good race
4951614 i gave it everything today it was a hard race im a little bit tired the heat swim was the second fastest 1500m i have ever done
4951615 im not sure what the future is for grant hackett but what he chooses he has been a wonderful ambassador to this sport and it was my privilege to race against him

4951624 a castle embodies luxury romance and chivalry and is laden with history and tradition
4951625 they are the ultimate status symbol and they were built to impress the beholder and to serve as the seat of ultimate power in the region
4951626 many castles feature an attentive and helpful staff but dont expect to receive the level or variety of services you would in a five star hotel
4951627 castles tend to be in more remote or rural areas so fine dining and other entertainment options can be limited
4951628 for those who have a sense of history a bit of an adventurous streak and can swing with the unexpected a castle experience can be memorable and most rewarding
4951629 but it was worth every penny and its donating to a great cause
4951630 they were previously enclaves for explorers or for the very wealthy now theres no exclusivity or privacy

4951639 back in 2000 the best rooms in the city were at the baltschug kempinski hotel which cost about 800 a night
4951640 today you can spend 18 000 for a night in the best suite at the ritz carlton prices have gone way up on the high end and the weak dollar makes moscow even more expensive for american travelers were seeing less of them

4951655 if youre going to kill the animal it seems only polite to use the whole thing
4951656 youre not just picking up a phone and ordering parts this makes you want to use every last bit you dont want to throw anything out
4951657 i like slowly simmering it and pulling the meat off the head then taking the liquid it was cooked in and turning it into gelatin its a journey to look at an ugly pigs head and turn it into a beautiful terrine

4951672 it feels almost like youre in the water with them
4951673 weve invested 35 million in the pool complex over the last two seasons
4951674 the pool is our most important business driver during the season march to november and our analysis suggests that it also increases our room rates
4951675 i have people calling just to ask can we come just to look at the pool

4951712 but the business at hand is to win and put people in the seats youre incapable of doing that and youre going to look foolish if you insist on building your team around first year players when all the others are beating you with a wealth of experience and talent
4951713 when youre in a developmental league for rookies youre there for specifically that very reason
4951714 their main concern is your growth and development theyre tuning you up its not a matter of your numbers or so much your ability even that is keeping you around
4951715 you get to be patient with your at bats and your innings pitched players cant get that here when youre trying to win a division championship in a season that is already pretty short there isnt that type of time for teams to nurture you
4951716 youre constantly facing guys who have a better playing background
4951717 generally you figure the younger guys in rookie ball are more apt to making mistakes
4951718 the hitters who are more seasoned are the ones that make you earn your outs theyre going to make you battle to find ways to keep them off base
4951719 ive learned a ton from being at the park every day with those guys
4951720 its like how they always say you graduate from college and they give you a piece of paper telling you that you did it but what about life experience how much of that does a college degree give you there are certain situations you have to live through before you can make it by

4951763 im a 24 year old graphic designer from northern vermont i design and lay out childrens books and put my heart and soul into making them fun and easy to understand for all levels of reading

4951765 im 47 year old who enjoys living everyday of my life to the fullest my family is the most important part of my life i love playing softball watching college and pro football and basketball
4951766 im a mural artist who has discovered the challenge of painting on canvas rather than walls its limited space but i love it what better place to crawl into your thoughts when you can create them in front of your own eyes
4951767 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job
4951768 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
4951769 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but

4951772 i am happy at betis and everyone should be clear that my present and my future depends on betis
4951773 clearly in the mind of the president he was always trying to bring him here but if the player has confusing ideas leaving and then not wanting to there is little calderon could do
4951774 if there is one place we must all see this year what is it
4951775 theres no way you can choose a single english site the country is so rich
4951776 if youre interested in henry viii for example you go to eltham palace if youre interested in queen victoria you go to osborne house you pick you choose the ideal site for you
4951777 we take it less seriously than say the french or the americans
4951778 part of the reason is that like the italians we have so much of it and also partly i think it has been so badly taught in our schools and theres been no conscious sense of teaching people a national story
4951779 in fact its been regarded almost as a bad idea unlike the americans because of their history of their constitution and the french because of the self consciousness of their national identity
4951780 we english should start doing the same we have something that is profoundly to be proud of
4951781 i certainly think that what is instructive about queen elizabeth i is her awareness of the importance of popularity
4951782 its her awareness of the need to play to the gallery as it were and not to be ashamed of it but is a dangerous lesson there are as many problems as princess diana demonstrated as advantages monarchy isnt risk free
4951783 im not surprised i put forward the arguments that enable me to get those payments television is a popular medium
4951784 as with newspapers you are paid by how many people buy your paper and it is an entirely rational calculation and indeed i would argue that i am probably rather underpaid on a comparative basis
4951785 if you bear in mind that the series six wives of henry viii got a larger audience than anything recently on channel 4 apart from big brother
4951786 we chose manchester because it has an excellent transport and business infrastructure a wide and deep pool of talent and it aligns with regulatory and customer expectations of diversifying our business locations
4951787 ps please bring your camera phone to get a picture of breakfast
4951788 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4951789 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4951790 after their complaint was overruled our olympians calmly swallowed the injustice
4951791 the sensor is not a woman it needs to be hit
4951792 happy but likely to have some regrets over the race for years to come
4951793 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4951794 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4951795 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4951796 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4951797 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4951798 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4951799 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4951801 its going to end in the pockets of the people in the government anyway
4951802 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you have to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
4951803 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviours from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans
4951804 whoever lost this game would probably cross over and see america as everybody here already knows america being who they are there was a lot riding on this game
4951805 you dont want to cross over with the united states until the gold medal we were both trying to avoid meeting them too early
4951806 they started hard hedging and trapping and rotating and unfortunately we didnt do a very good job of keeping floor space
4951807 weve been fighting and scratching and biting and punching to get back
4951808 for us to be good enough to win the gold we have to put together 40 minutes
4951809 from where i sit if any other team in this tournament has a crack at the u s and can beat them im sure it can be the russians theyve already done it

4951831 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
4951832 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
4951833 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time
4951834 obviously scotty would have been a tremendous help for our ballclub
4951835 when you look at the last three games theyve all be one run games and one swing of the bat could have made the difference but it is what it is
4951836 this game is very humbling and you cant take anything for granted were just in the position were in and we have to deal with it
4951837 when we came in here our bullpen was going to get us through
4951838 if we could get to the sixth inning we felt very comfortable well continue playing that game until we execute
4951839 the way this tournaments starting to come around it looks like any team can win
4951840 weve seen upsets already a 4 3 record at the end of this tournament may or may not get you in itll probably come down to tiebreakers
4951841 the stars are going to have to align right now
4951842 well do the additions and subtractions at the end of the seventh game
4951843 bailan para demostrar su fervor religioso y su resistencia f sica bailando en interminables jornadas s lo que aqu los vemos desde otra perspectiva los danzaqs peruanos bailan pero con un fondo musical distinto
4951844 a person can learn a lot from a dog even a loopy one like ours
4951845 marley taught me about living each day with unbridled exuberance and joy about seizing the moment and following your heart he taught me to appreciate the simple things a walk in the woods a fresh snowfall a nap in a shaft of winter sunlight and as he grew old and achy he taught me about optimism in the face of adversity mostly he taught me about friendship and selflessness and above all else unwavvering loyalty
4951846 the average wrestler probably retires about 100 times a year and sometimes three or four times in a day
4951847 its tough its physical and its emotional you get tired and you get battered and bruised and sometimes you just want to pitch it
4951848 this ones a bit different because i won my match to get to the podium whereas a silver you lost so its a different emotion
4951849 but i have to say im really really happy with my performance
4951850 weve got ballet beams and chalkboards and theyre all bent from wrestlers banging into them
4951851 theres a lot of people who are winning gold medals here who dont come from the most glamourous environments
4951852 does that build the strength and the character and the motivation to produce medals i think theres some merit to that
4951853 the last four years have been a character builder for me
4951854 for me to finish off like this because this will be my last olympics i really cant complain
4951855 im a little bit reluctant to change the environment that has produced success
4951856 people have been saying i could have run 9 60 but i havent seen the replays he said
4951857 i had a pretty good start and i felt i was with him till about 50 metres
4951858 i was comfortable in second position and i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line hes a phenomenal athlete and i dont think theres any way anyone would have beaten him with a run like that
4951859 you havent seen anything yet hes going to run a 9 55 said canadas donovan bailey who owned this night and set the previous olympic record of 9 84 12 years ago in atlanta
4951860 its my last meet ever and i have nothing to lose
4951861 its an olympic final and just knowing that may relax me
4951862 its just another game in pool play that we had to go out there and get and i think we went out there and did a good job of doing that
4951863 its another team we had to go out there and beat
4951864 were not chasing perfection but the small things are what wins ball games and we got away from that after 2000 the last time they won the olympic gold not being able to do the little things
4951865 we thought our athletic ability was going to win ball games and that wasnt the case so now that you see us doing the little things making the extra pass playing defence it makes the game so much easier
4951866 i thought chris boshs performance was outstanding he scored two points but he had seven defensive rebounds and he anchored our defence
4951867 his defence led to us having confidence and playing passing lanes a little bit more
4951868 she lets you know what she wants in a very professional manner
4951869 you definitely listen to what she has to say shes definitely a calming presence and thats something thats just great about her
4951870 she has come in and built a good program and built a good staff around her
4951871 when i went out to the mound after the drama that had happened with that play it was all about making sure nobody left that pitching circle until they were ready to commit to the next batter
4951872 i made a pact before the china game with some of my players we were going to hold each other accountable to doing what we needed to do but making sure before the next pitch was thrown we were invested in that one
4951873 my first routine was really rough and at one point i thought i was coming off the trampoline
4951874 at first when i saw my score i was really disappointed i never score that low but i tried to re focus and say well at least you stayed on the trampoline you still have a chance here
4951875 i am very excited for the finals that was my main goal coming in
4951876 people have no idea how hard it is to win a medal at the olympics
4951877 but what it comes down to is the form and staying in the middle of the trampoline ive been trying to perfect minor things in my routines to score the maximum points i can
4951878 the strategy for them is to go big in the finals because they have no chance of getting a medal being outsiders in the field
4951879 im totally thrilled i realized i shouldnt have filed my nails last night but its my best time ever as much as i wanted to win im very happy i got the silver
4951880 to put things in perspective she was talking about childbirth in the ready room
4951881 in 2005 everybody said i couldnt run but i showed today what i can do
4951882 we had to restrain the firemen from running around town with the fire trucks ringing the sirens
4951883 everybodys just overjoyed nobody deserved it more than she its great
4951884 those policies are there for a reason mam its clearly stated in your terms and conditions every year telecom loses over 1000000 due to late payments
4951885 if im spending this time and effort to improve my health then i should be taking my diet seriously no point exercising then going and eating maccas straight after
4951886 i came here to be a champion and i am i was relaxed
4951887 there was no way to catch him no one could
4951888 it was only a matter of time that bolt did this hes been running very fast since he was young
4951889 so many people said it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4951890 its gone from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredths to winning the 400 free by nine one hundredths to getting my best time in every event
4951891 it has been nothing but an upward roller coaster its been nothing but fun
4951892 anything could happen i just wanted to go out hard and hold on as strong as i could
4951893 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put together a solid team effort and we were able to come together as one unit
4951894 for the three olympics ive been a part of this has been by far the closest mens team weve ever had
4951895 its gone from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredths to winning the 400 free by nine one hundredths to getting my best time in every event
4951896 maybe it comes around once in a lifetime its almost disbelief to some degree
4951897 it was a great pb for me in a fast race
4951898 the whole year and the last four years ive had my mind set on august of 08 thats when i was going to be at my best and be healthy
4951899 that was the goal all the little things in between the ups and downs it was all still for these last few days i wanted 6 500 and was 10 points off great score i was really happy with my personal bests and the other ones werent bad either im just very happy
4951900 i ran my heart out and felt like crap afterward she said with a big smile
4951901 jamaica is a factory of great runners and bolt is the newest addition to a long long list
4951902 bolt was representing jamaica while other runners often run for other countries like the united states and canada
4951903 akhil had fought him doniyorov before and knew a lot about him
4951904 we talked about the fight last night all the credit goes to him
4951905 it was a hard race and i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half but i just couldnt be happier
4951906 it was really hard to compete on the last day and the team has been so supportive
4951907 and i think we really showed what we can do we set so many canadian records 22 this week i think were all really ecstatic to be canadians right now
4951908 i like being psyched up by the team and i think being on a team is such a great experience everyone was just unbelievably supportive so it was great
4951909 i could see prilukov coming and i knew he was going to have a good back end so i just did whatever i could to hold him off
4951910 me and my coach randy bennett have been working together for seven years now and he just knows me and i know him it has been a climb but it has been a great experience
4951911 we did what we could to get here and its such a fast final i just couldnt be happier to be part of it
4951912 the thing is hes such a nice guy as well you cant help but be pleased for the guy that hes doing so well but its kinda hard when you want to beat him all the time
4951913 sometimes i have felt bad when i have beaten him not that ive beaten him very often i think ive only beat him twice in the last however many years hes certainly a real favourite for winning two golds
4951914 adams the sort of athlete who copes with that pressure very very well
4951915 thats probably why he might come across as cocky to some people because he can cope with that pressure he doesnt sort of buckle doesnt show the strain thats all part of being a world class olympic champion
4951916 im sure that must bring the rest of the canadian team up as well because they see the way he acts and he carries himself
4951917 you cant really say otherwise looking at the way hes gone so far with his world cup medals
4951918 without a doubt youd put your money on him as one of the favourites but theres a few other guys you wouldnt rule out and i think adams not stupid enough to rule anyone out either he knows its going to be a tough race and hes going to need the race of his life to win
4951919 yes we had experiences back in athens but this has been a whole different story the whole way along
4951920 today is more satisfaction for having a good piece and winning a medal rather than atoning for past losses
4951921 its all part of who we are today as athletes yeah winning a medal today is a lot better than crashing into the south africans four years ago
4951922 we play golf we bowl were in japan in our camp and hes competitive at everything he does he gets all fired up daves a little more relaxed kind of happy go lucky he felt like he had a rebirth this year hes just been really relaxed and easy to work with open to coaching and criticism i think the two of them together kind of offset each other a little bit
4951923 i believed every step of the way that i would be here
4951924 i knew that with the right pair partner we could be on the medal podium
4951925 my late grandfather built me a wooden case for my medals and he always had faith that one day thered be an olympic medal in there
4951926 and i wasnt so sure and its worked out this things going to go in that box and nobodys ever going to be able to take it away from me
4951927 he was a golden boy from the time they put him in our arms at 6 weeks old
4951928 he was one of those babies that i remember when he was 1 year old thinking if i picked him out of a sears catalogue i could not have picked out the features in a child that we got in dave hes always been very loving very gentle very caring
4951929 at about 6 or 7 weeks old when babies are starting to pull themselves up he would do chin ups in his crib
4951930 so i would come in to get him after a nap and he would be standing against his crib rungs and i would be thinking my goodness hes grown a lot all of a sudden and id realize hes six inches off the mattress
4951931 hes always been strong hes always been focused and passionate about stuff but really for us the gift that you cant describe a real golden boy from day one were just very very very proud
4951932 we would send him off to go retrieve objects from our room on the second floor and time how quickly he could run up and back we would say i bet you couldnt go get my
4951933 i knew i could ride a top eight with a good race a perfect race for me would be a top five really the only decision i would take back to get a top five is that second shot at it when i tried to go for a lap
4951934 i was thinking fifth or a medal well ill roll the dice and try and go for a medal if i come back i know ill be able to hang in for a top eight if it was world championships or the world cup or anything else like that i would have made the decision to stay back and go for the sprint
4951935 but i took the low probability because hey its the olympics you only get one chance every four years if youre not going to roll the dice once especially that close to the end when youve met your preliminary goals youre a bit of a doughnut i think
4951936 the second great age of globalization may share the fate of the first
4951937 our grandfathers lived in a world of largely self sufficient inward looking national economies but our great great grandfathers lived as we do in a world of large scale international trade and investment a world destroyed by nationalism
4951938 it does mark the end of the pax americana the era in which the united states more or less maintained a monopoly on the use of military force and that raises some real questions about the future of globalization
4951939 tell us not to worry global economic integration itself protects us against war they argue because successful trading economies wont risk their prosperity by engaging in military adventurism
4951940 f or example war among the nations of western europe really does seem inconceivable now not so much because of economic ties as because of shared democratic values
4951941 much of the world however including nations that play a key role in the global economy doesnt share those values

4951944 ma forse mi devo vergognare per aver fatto quello che ho fatto
4951945 le persone che devono vergognarsi sono loro non io io a quella ragazza ho solo dato affetto io ho la coscienza a posto
4951946 all ye hail the blind skellyton the ski lodge hes so blind he has candy in his eye
4951947 i think there were some positive things on both sides
4951948 we held our own but our goals are way higher than just holding our own
4951949 what we got done was there was opportunity for some of the competitions to be sorted out
4951950 and i think there were plenty of repetitions to make sure that happened what the final assessment will be we wont know until we watch film
4951951 i wanted to get it in every time we have got to be more consistent we have to have a nice drive every time we step on the field
4951952 the offense has been getting a lot of the headlines lately so it was nice to see the defensive side rise up and establish themselves everyone from the first team on down played with enthusiasm pursued to the ball and made plays we had four quarterback sacks and forced three fumbles so i was really pleased with that side of the ball
4951953 d wade might be the most impressive player we have
4951954 you see what happens when that outside shooting is going for us
4951955 you dont see the stuff behind the scenes hes a great teammate
4951956 i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport
4951957 during the opening ceremonies i was the only utahn out there it was just me it gets a little lonely
4951958 i go to see all the people i havent seen in a year
4951959 i have to because we have to start putting in the game plan for unlv
4951960 hes still got to learn things like pass protection but he knows where the holes are and hes a very good runner with the ball in his hands
4951961 it was unbelievable it was a moment ill remember forever
4951962 i dont even remember did i block anything i didnt do anything out there i was just a big guy out there every once in a while id turn around and set him im big slow clumsy and he covers all the ground i cant
4951963 i somehow got my hand under it without getting it caught in the sand and got a little bit of pop on it and got up
4951964 there wasnt really any way i could go but left handed if i wanted to get a swing on it it just happened
4951965 it worries you because kyle brady had it last year but this time off will be good
4951966 theyve been doing it for about two or three years now
4951967 you gotta expect the move call is going to happen and that the defense is going to try and bait you to jump offsides the ref isnt going to be able to hear that when you have 110 000 people so you have to be disciplined
4951968 i loved basketball and i was blessed with a big old body and a little skill i loved testing myself against the greatest players in the world and i loved playing for a great coach in lenny wilkens ill always cherish my basketball career
4951969 you have to be passionate if you want to be successful
4951970 if you are driven to be successful and if you have people around you who want to be successful thats what its all about
4951971 grew up around racing my dad and my uncles did some drag racing and i worked on cars a lot as a kid
4951972 we worked on cars together we did just about everything together and everything sort of fell into place
4951973 we had a lot of fun with cars and it kept us out of trouble
4951974 i finally had enough money to put a few nickels into racing
4951975 brad transcends the preconceived ideas and myths about athletes in business

4951985 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed

4951999 qui proprio una questione di mentalit se i mezzi pubblici costano di pi per i turisti come pu un ristoratore non sentirsi autorizzato a far lievitare i prezzi per i forestieri e cos a un veneziano la pizza costa 15 euro trenta a un viaggiatore e se straniero ancor pi tartassato
4952000 you must always align your remuneration scheme with your objectives
4952001 is your objective to achieve effective cross selling across the firm for example you wont achieve that without a culture of sharing so you need to ask whether your remuneration system will encourage that
4952002 which partner has passed on the most work to you in the last 12 months
4952003 you have to ask what kind of firm you actually are are we collegiate are we bottom line driven then look where you want to get to in terms of strategy and build your remuneration scheme around that
4952004 us firms have come into the london marketplace and brought in their underlying culture which is much more performance driven
4952005 management wasnt valued ten years ago and there was a view that you werent really a good lawyer unless you had your head down doing client work but that is all starting to change and firms are looking to reward skills such as leadership and management
4952006 we incorporated three years ago and had to find a mechanism to reward people at market level or more but the big shift for us was to move rapidly to this system of a performance model it has been a long process to inculcate the culture of that it is something that is quite counter cultural for law firms and were getting better at it each year
4952007 weve been able to set down exactly what excellent performance looks like at mourant
4952008 you have to have the technical skills but it is how you deliver against those in terms of things like management skills or developing client relationships
4952009 you can actually put in place hard edged measures around things like client satisfaction or attitude surveys
4952010 but some areas can be controversial one way we take the heat out of it is to agree up front with a person how we are going to measure it the performance model sets out in a detailed way how excellent performance manifests itself and we get agreement on that
4952011 allowing sufficient time for the process has probably been the reason that it is viewed as fair people trust those making the award and are fully informed as to the reasoning behind the awards
4952012 accordingly for a line partner we will look at how work is managed within their immediate team and what their fees are
4952013 but we will have particular regard to movement on the value of their client portfolio cross sales significant client wins and losses as they might not be reflected in the financials and then try and balance this with 360 degree feedback
4952014 the difficulty is that the hard data tends to be about the financial contribution a partner makes so were looking at how to introduce harder evidence in the non financial areas and in terms of financial data the emphasis is on profitability management rather than simply increased turnover
4952015 people want what they are worth and firms have to look at how to match reward to contribution fairly its also a question of relative worth what am i being paid compared to the person sitting next to me
4952016 lockstep promotes cross collaboration and the cultural elements that are important to us as a firm collaboration is vital in terms of generating business across offices and ensuring effective cross selling
4952017 but when operating a single lockstep structure where different factors are at play it can produce some strains which can become relevant in terms of competing for and retaining the best talent i believe we need flexibility while retaining the positive aspects of lockstep so were looking at what level of flexibility is needed going forward
4952018 were in a business where you have to go the extra mile but what we cant do is run constantly
4952019 our approach is to make the firm attractive enough to make sure it can recruit and retain enough of the right kind of people to take on the work
4952020 were keen to get the balance right however there arent always enough people out there of the right quality so sometimes people will have to do more weve worked hard to have greater transparency and more objective measures which helps make the firm an attractive place to work
4952021 we do not have a lot of issues in terms of reward we have no departments and no separation whatsoever so we work as the big team cleary serving the client and i think the lockstep system works really well there is no competitiveness amongst the lawyers
4952022 we have had to make a couple of changes based on the practical application of the scheme
4952023 the major one was to reduce the number of merit categories from five to four as it was proving difficult to differentiate between partners performance across the five categories by moving to four and increasing the differential in terms of reward it has become easier to allocate partners and single out those whose performance showed clear water from other partners
4952024 in our case the scheme was part of a bigger plan to improve the performance of the firm and therefore overall take for the partners inevitably if you change a scheme there will be winners and losers on a stand still basis they must see that overall the scheme will help achieve improvement in which they can all share
4952025 weve made significant strides in achieving greater clarity and becoming a more performance driven organisation but it is a process that takes a long time with something so emotive as peoples remuneration you have to work hard to get that right people dont just work for the money but it is sometimes the only tangible thing that they have
4952026 it is important people are told they are doing a good job and where there are concerns it is not used as a stick to beat people with you have to be good to succeed in this business its about getting good people to be great people you need a developmental culture and people have to be comfortable they will be supported in the firm

4952029 to put it simply our usually peaceful coexistence has been threatened by a hostile and outside force that is hellbent on our mutual destruction if there was any shred of a doubt it should be gone now we knew about this months ago and yet nothing was done and by our inaction we have allowed the problem to grow and grow until it has become something that not even the full combined force of the chans can keep at bay the hordes of b raided anontalk a few days ago in the thousands flooding spamming all a just recompense for the months of faggotry endured at the hands of anontalk but nothing prepared them for what awaited not even ackbar could have foreseen the trap we had stumbled into anontalk com was the most exploit ridden malware spewing website that i have seen for as long as i can remember the effects were swift and brutal nothing stood in their way whether it be firefox linux peerguardian or whatever the skiddies used to cover their tracks
4952030 what you can do well what can you do really i even don t know what to do anymore everyone is totally disorganized ill try and briefly outline what i know 1 this is not a raid we have tried that the results are well known right now we are not seeking numbers because numbers work against us what we need are people who actually know what they are doing to meet on irc irc irc partyvan fm anontalkraid quality not quantity 2 ddos seems to be the only thing to keep them down without an hero in the process but be warned they change the dns a lot and redirect requests to other sites and servers ours you absolutely must be on irc to have realtime updates of the backend ip or you will end up ddosing chans this is not something that can simply be left on all night you have to literally watch it like a hawk 3 keep it a secret 7chan fucked up by publicly showing their support for the fight by telling people what to do on their front page now the cat is out of the bag keep things low key don t mention where you come from the last thing i intended was to actually get you guys involved over your heads in this
4952031 whats typical of self absorbed internet e penisery is that while complaining that b attacked and ruined other boards there are thousands of users who enjoy 4chan and never even go on b and now cant use the site

4952038 dag these bra straps are uncomfortable because ive got this huge rack and it can be annoying sometimes
4952039 we knew going into this series that we had to play all nine innings in order to beat them
4952040 we know if we have our starting nine in there and our pitchers throw well we have a good chance of winning day in and day out
4952041 we take it pitch by pitch with the lineup that we have if we put together good games theres a good chance were going to win in the end
4952042 they had a pitcher knew to the league who didnt know carl and what he can hit
4952043 carls a pretty smart hitter he watched the at bats of the other guys knew what to look for and got it hes been carrying us for awhile too
4952044 before the seventh inning i said lets get them with the bloops
4952045 we were hitting the ball hard all night and had nothing to show for it we got a couple of breaks there we are a momentum team if a couple of guys get hits everyone feels confident

4952052 ron paul lent his name status and newsletter distribution channel to horrifying racist things written by someone else
4952053 supports the mass murder of innocent people based on geography
4952054 i also know that ron has long championed martin luther king as one of his heroes
4952055 if those things came from lew rockwell and ron paul is so morally opposed to them its pretty difficult to explain his continued close relationship with rockwell is this the sort of thing we can expect if he becomes president
4952056 president paul said he personally disapproves of secretary of the interior rockwells plans to allow individual states to re introduce slavery but he not only feels that the federal government has no power to intervene here but he also has a strong personal relationship with secretary rockwell which he doesnt want to endanger
4952057 the only way for ron paul to get over this at least for me would be to publicly apologize and strongly and personally take a stand against those views
4952058 amazing how many of you pansies get your knickers in a twist when a candidate starts talking about the principles this country was founded upon
4952059 ill make sure ron gets the message i hear hes overwhelmingly concerned about getting the support of weak kneed dull eyed nancy boys
4952060 amazing how many of you pansies get your knickers all in a twist when a candidate starts talking about the principles this country was founded upon at the heart of it youre not upset over ron paul or who he is youre shit scared that if hes elected youll have to deal with the frightening concept of personal responsibility and not having a government that will coddle your weak soft asses

4952098 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs

4952100 have repeatedly refused to provide timely construction funding to the receiver
4952101 stands in stark contrast to their recent public assertions of extraordinary powers to control state spending regarding state employee salaries and other obligations
4952102 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
4952103 i indicated to the legislature that i did not want to be drawn into the budget vortex where late night deals are made without public consideration and without time for thoughtful consideration
4952104 i dont want to be drawn into that theyve had plenty of time since the failure of the bond bill to act on this ive waited really as long as i can wait i do have a serious cash flow issue i need to get resolved

4952113 countrys development programs are centrally determined planned funded and implemented by the national government in manila
4952114 concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4952115 the highly centralized system of government has brought about a spotty development of the nation where preferred treatment has been given to localities whose officials are friendly with or have easy access to an incumbent administration
4952116 this lopsided arrangement has spawned a host of problems including massive nationwide poverty to runaway insurgencies and rebellions that feed on the societal inequalities in the nation

4952171 thats one of my pet things as a manager i like to have a strong lower end of the lineup because sometimes the pitchers relax and think they are easy outs when they really arent
4952172 you try and soak up as much as you can
4952173 youre playing with carl everett and pete rose jr all the big leagues guys that have been there they know the game you try and learn from them
4952174 we thought once they pulled the tarp the game was going to be called it was a weird situation

4952184 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title
4952185 is finishing 12th and winning the league cup a successful season for us i dont think so
4952186 you see the real quality of a team after 38 games in the league cup or the fa cup if you win five games you can be in the final does that tell you the real quality no because real quality only comes out in the championship
4952187 if you dont win the league of course you are frustrated but the levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and two or three points is not a big gap we finished with 83 points last season and everywhere else in europe that would have made us champions
4952188 im not worried i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4952189 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances i am confident in us we lost only three games last season and we have a stability in our club which means we can keep improving i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4952190 i dont want us to be known as little old albion and we are going to strengthen the squad over the remainder of the transfer window
4952191 i hope we can add at least four bodies over the next few weeks because we want more quality out on the pitch

4952325 im trying to prepare myself by going to all the meetings and staying mentally sharp
4952326 things are looking good i feel that things have gotten progressively better since the first day it happened
4952327 a lot of things as far as doing everyday tasks like going in and lifting i can definitely tell how my body functions and how much better i am getting
4952328 they are seeing what i can do and going from there
4952329 they feel they have time to see how i progress the rest of this preseason to see how i heal up its an injury that takes time to heal its not a season ending injury
4952330 when it happened it stung it was kind of odd i finished up the series went over and it hurt and i finished the practice
4952331 obviously when youre new in a system you make sure that you practice he can use the reps but again i want to make sure that hes healthy before he goes out there
4952332 but again its something you work on especially in the weather conditions which we were involved in i thought everyone handled it well but we all look back on it and we want to learn from our mistakes
4952333 the first team had it the toughest especially the receivers
4952334 that was tough catching conditions out there for us it really wasnt that bad
4952335 my mentor who i have known for nine years and never opened up to he basically came to my house
4952336 i was in my room talking to people and thinking they were very concerned i was on the edge things werent going well i felt i must open up before its too late
4952337 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very in my mind unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just really felt there was no outlet my mom was there but i wanted the rest of her life to be worry free and i tried to keep everything from her i just felt alone
4952338 really showed me he cared and that meant a lot to me
4952339 i have the support of my teammates it feels good to get back on the field and be around the guys im very confident of their support if there is anyone who doubts me no one shows it theres been nothing but support here i feel back at home
4952340 you could tell that hes been working and looks strong
4952341 thats the important thing right now keep open communication like i said hes got a good support staff right now and i think hes in a good place well see how it works out
4952342 right now he is very upbeat and positive he feels better looks better in just the couple of days that hes been here weve seen a little bit of sense of relief when youre talking to him
4952343 when he moved up here and got on that same route and when we felt that he was in a good place we talked about the football part of it
4952344 thats kind of whats taken the time you get into these things the football part is secondary to the person we want to make sure that persons all right
4952345 there were a lot of rumors and like i said i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors
4952346 at the time coach reid didnt know people were saying contract or he didnt want to play football anymore i admit i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration
4952347 i didnt care what people thought they really didnt know they have a guy who is quick tempered it was to the point where i didnt really care anymore that wasnt the real me i didnt realize what i was going through
4952348 now that hes been here hes been received by his teammates and really the people that hes run into outside the building in a very positive manner
4952349 so you can see a little bit of the stress that he was carrying in his face hes got a little relief there thats a positive thing i think
4952350 ive been using my emotions and aggressions in my workouts
4952351 im feeling pretty strong that 331 is lighter than what i would be playing
4952352 ive received a lot of phone calls from public figures and people who have gone through what im going through
4952353 ive also learned that among african american men and really men period we just hold things in whether its a football player or a man you are still like im a man nothing bothers me but if you internalize it it has to come out somewhere
4952354 people question my silliness but im a fun loving guy being around people i dont care what creed you are it just ignites my silliness youll never know if im hurting on the inside i found out
4952355 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4952356 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing

4952374 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4952375 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4952376 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4952604 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

4952612 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4952613 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4952614 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4952615 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4952616 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4952617 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4952618 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4952619 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4952620 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4952621 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4952622 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4952623 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4952624 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4952625 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4952626 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4952627 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4952628 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4952642 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4952643 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4952644 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4952645 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4952646 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4952652 el nico argumento para que madrid 2016 decidiese no hacer aqu el canal de remo es que getafe est m s cerca
4952653 en sentido estricto aranjuez no puede considerarse subsede porque est a menos de 50 kil metros de la capital
4952654 el canal de remo supone la destrucci n del parque lineal del manzanares

4952657 a pesar de todo esto el compromiso del gobierno municipal est incumplido a d a de hoy ni se han realizado las actuaciones comprometidas por gallard n ni se ha abierto el castillo al p blico

4952661 we have seen a trend in several of our top hotel markets of more guests at hotels being locals or from nearby areas
4952662 houston for example has seen some of the most significant increases in this category
4952663 we do know the word on the street is that its happening
4952664 people join for getting towed but stay for the extra benefits
4952665 there was a lot of pre shopping rental cars hotels where to eat
4952666 at that time a lot of people may have decided to stay in the area because of fuel prices

4952688 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
4952689 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor

4952693 at the world half marathon championships in canada everybody said i could not run but i showed today what i can do
4952694 disappointed is not in my vocabulary when im doing this
4952695 but my legs didnt have enough running behind them i felt like i was just running on one leg
4952696 they told me when it the stress fracture was diagnosed that it would be impossible for me to be here
4952697 i just wouldnt believe that i wanted to come and try it
4952698 this is ev leave a message have a good day
4952699 have a good day yo how many lighters you got in your pocket right now man that shit is wrong you do this every time
4952700 what curdles my blood is that precious sanctimonious new age version of i feel god in this tree type of thing
4952701 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4952702 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
4952703 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
4952704 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
4952705 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
4952706 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
4952707 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
4952708 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
4952709 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
4952710 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
4952711 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
4952712 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
4952713 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
4952714 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
4952715 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
4952716 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
4952717 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
4952718 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
4952719 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
4952720 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
4952721 people talk of global warming but dont go out and do anything about it
4952722 i only plant trees that are strong have long life provide shade and are useful to society they should impede neither traffic nor pedestrians
4952723 just planting a tree and taking a photo with it is a very immature act if you want to grow a useful healthy tree you need to be willing to spend rs 1 500 to rs 2 000 per tree and two to three years tending to it till it becomes stable and strong
4952724 you have to examine the soil prepare the hole and only then plant a sapling
4952725 we made many mistakes and spent a lot of money before we learnt the right way to grow healthy trees
4952726 you can learn a lot from just growing one tree i always say trees are the best friend of man but man is the worst enemy of trees
4952727 people from adyar and tiruvanmiyur who are travelling to puducherry cuddalore and further south had to go all the way to the north of the city to koyambedu to get their bus that made no sense wasting all that fuel and time
4952728 this reduces traffic congestion and fuel use and also saves time
4952729 i believe you should go out and do what you can rather than just complain or tell other people how to do the job he says

4952733 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4952734 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4952735 this is huge damage not just for georgia but for armenia and azerbaijan and central asian countries which are shipping goods and oil by georgian railway
4952736 the russians these barbarians want to destroy our country economically
4952737 the elephants and pianos were all on my shoulders my heart was pounding and my stomach gone its a long way if youre feeling like that
4952738 i knew the 36 hours in between would be a race to recover and i did everything i could but in the end it was really telling on me and it caught me out
4952739 the times swam here in beijing were like nothing i have experienced before it was incredibly tough just to qualify for the final
4952740 to qualify for the final i had to swim my best time for four years and im impressed with those guys who clocked those kind of times in the final just 36 hours after a huge hit in qualifying
4952741 normally you can stroll through the heats but i had to swim a world class time just to get through and it took its toll in the back end of that final i tried to kick but the tank was empty
4952742 i tried my best but sadly i did not have the recovery powers
4952743 the event has changed and everybody is going to have to re think their strategies this is now basically a 1500m sprint its unbelievable
4952744 now if i want to carry on in this event for another four years ive got to find a way to do maxed out 1500m in a short space of time if i want to compete
4952745 i would have liked to have gone quicker but ive got to recover for the 10k that will be a different challenge and a tough test and im looking forward to it
4952746 i had expectations for the 400m freestyle but this is a great surprise
4952747 i felt good in the first 400m of this race and at the 800m and 900m i started believing that i could win
4952748 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100m to save my energy and attack in the final 50m
4952749 im not sure im a little older now ill see what i feel like have a break then see what happens
4952750 to get second is great but three in a row would have been nice
4952751 i have certainly no regrets in my preparation and what ive been able to do here it was certainly a good race
4952752 i gave it everything today it was a hard race im a little bit tired the heat swim was the second fastest 1500m i have ever done
4952753 im not sure what the future is for grant hackett but what he chooses he has been a wonderful ambassador to this sport and it was my privilege to race against him
4952754 to be within a shot of winning three olympic titles in this the hardest and most gruelling swimming event of the lot was an amazing achievement

4952767 i think its a very different thing for someone to desecrate a jewish grave with a swastika than comparing what israel is doing to palestinians with what the nazis did

4952810 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4952811 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4952812 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4952813 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4952814 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4952815 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4952816 it worries you because kyle brady had it last year but this time off will be good

4952818 you gotta expect the move call is going to happen and that the defense is going to try and bait you to jump offsides the ref isnt going to be able to hear that when you have 110 000 people so you have to be disciplined
4952819 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4952820 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4952821 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4952822 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4952823 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4952824 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4952825 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4952826 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4952827 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

4952829 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4952830 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4952831 i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport
4952832 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4952833 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4952834 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4952835 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4952836 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4952837 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4952838 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4952839 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4952840 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4952841 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4952842 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4952843 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4952844 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4952845 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4952846 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4952847 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

4952852 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4952853 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4952854 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4952855 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4952856 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4952857 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4952858 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4952859 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4952860 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4952861 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4952862 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4952863 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4952864 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4952865 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4952866 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4952867 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4952868 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4952869 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4952870 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4952871 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4952872 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4952873 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4952874 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4952875 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4952876 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4952877 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4952878 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4952879 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4952896 from st peters college i went to kyambogo to train as a junior secondary school teacher for two years
4952897 i was inspired to teach by the smartness discipline and good english spoken by the teachers at that time
4952898 the teacher was a role model in society at the time but today everything has changed things have gone wrong everywhere and nobody portrays a true reflection of what his or her profession is supposed to be
4952899 you cannot love and dedicate your time to what you never liked or wished to be the teachers today do not show any professional conduct for instance in terms of character and the dress code
4952900 during our time children were successful in school and other aspects of life because of being obedient but today childrens rights have made them disrespectful be it to teachers or parents
4952901 our children today have lost direction and do not want to be guided they consider secondary things such as discos and watching pornographic videos as the most important aspects of their lives
4952902 it is difficult today because the conditions of living have greatly changed but i have not personally found it a problem because i have balanced my equation well
4952903 i had a policy that wherever i was posted to teach i had to catch something a woman there that is how i got my two wives here
4952904 the discipline of children today has gone down because we have left the responsibility to only their respective families in the past the discipline and upbringing of all children in a given locality depended on the collective responsibility of everybody
4952905 but today one cannot punish a neighbours child you will be charged with criminal trespass assault etc depending on the gravity of the punishment you gave to such a child this has made children disrespectful of anybody who is not their parent

4952961 surprisingly 20 million europeans need access to safe and affordable sanitation
4952962 now weve stopped discussing whether or not there has been climate change or where or who has been contributing to it

4952966 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned and it helped me
4952967 i wouldnt have done it without the help of the team
4952968 we came together as a unit of the three olympics ive been a part of this by far is the closest mens team weve ever had
4952969 it is fitting that at one of the most significant events of our generation we have witnessed one of the greatest performances in olympic history michaels record breaking performance during these games will inspire millions of people around the world to reach for their goals and aspire to greatness he is an example of the very best values of the olympic movement and our country
4952970 from winning by one one hundreth to doing a best time in every event its been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and nothing but fun for me
4952971 i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
4952972 no all four rounds he didnt do what we were telling him
4952973 third round i came out firing i was thinking that maybe id be up by two points but they said it was tied up
4952974 in that last round i went in there with my hands up i know i hit him with a straight left he caught me with the hook ill give them that but i think i caught him with two more punches and should have won the fight 8 7
4952975 we wanted him to box but the main thing we wanted him to do was get up early get ahead first we knew he had faster hands and more power so we wanted him to engage and make the guy have to come to him
4952976 instead they started playing the waiting game from the beginning we yelled at him talked to him between rounds but he basically did the opposite of what we asked him to do
4952977 one of the things we know is that these kids have been calling home so often
4952978 what happens is they get instructions all the way from the united states you can tell the difference because once the bell rings they start doing what their other coaches tell them
4952979 they were trying to tell me to just go at him go at him
4952980 im not that type of fighter to go out there and throw punches if i do that im going to get caught with shots i want to go out there and play it smart
4952981 luis was actually a very aggressive boxer until tonight one of the things thats always helped luis is his aggression but for some reason tonight he decided to stand back and wait and it cost him

4952983 yes i was born in russia but since for so many years ive lived in the u s i feel i represent the united states of america
4952984 i feel like im more of an american than a russian but im very proud of my heritage and proud of being a russian
4952985 i go back at least once a year and visit my grandparents and my family and friends
4952986 it makes it so special to me i always feel a little more russian when im there
4952987 it is a pity that nastya sic is now an american
4952988 i definitely feel that i went out there today and represented both countries
4952989 i am competing for the u s but with my name being nastia i hope i made my family and fans proud in russia as well as in the united states
4952990 america gave me many opportunities i dont think i would have been able to achieve the same results in russia 15 years ago it was just not possible

4953096 it was so sad to hear about isaac hayes so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best god bless
4953097 i last saw isaac a while back in washington d c at a concert where we were both performing although he was under the weather he was still performing he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls god bless his family
4953098 three time grammy winner isaac hayes was a true renaissance man singer songwriter producer session musician actor activist and more his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
4953099 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend to me there will only be one isaac hayes gifting us with years of performing writing and a voice that penetrated deep into our souls he is to be admired for changing his life around and standing steadfast to his beliefs his integrity and to helping others isaac you will be missed but never forgotten
4953100 isaac was one of the more genuine and beautiful souls i have had the privilege to cross paths with and befriend in this life he was an incredible friend this is a tragic loss my heart goes out to his wife and children wherever he is going to just became a brighter and more beautiful place and i will miss him dearly
4953101 well thats it thats every pair of shoes in the place

4953107 i beg your pardon good sir but may i ask
4953108 if something is driving the people insane then it could happen to us as well
4953109 we are just passing through weve come all the way from celladorn on official business of the cenoc
4953110 you see our ship the went down several weeks ago in a rather nasty storm we were the only survivors im sure that if you were to check with the harbor master he can confirm that the was on his docket to arrive some time ago but has yet to reach port
4953111 please believe us we have been traveling for many days with very little food or water we are tired and hungry all we want is to find a warm bed a hot meal and then continue on our way to shaldun
4953112 strange things have been happening surely you noticed the large numbers of people leaving
4953113 about half of them are mad and the rest are frightened beyond all reason
4953114 the gentry and nobles have locked their doors and are reluctant to let even their servants out they sure as hell arent letting anyone in
4953115 i dont know if you are who you say you are but we wont stop you if you want to enter youll find nothing but madness in there if you cause any trouble theyre likely to tear you apart
4953116 part of our business concerns him he was supposed to have been here when we arrived but since were so late
4953117 he was here for the gathering of nobles before the city went sour word has it that his is the only noble house in the city that is actively searching for a way to fix whats wrong
4953118 im afraid not ive tried just about every place in this town im half convinced there are no rooms to be had
4953119 whispers of subterfuge and conspiracy you know the war between darias and shaldun is still fresh on a lot of peoples minds shaldun is our governing province after all
4953120 i thought you might you claim to be on cenoc business from celladorn but your face and accent have darias written all over them the young woman has the right look but you and the other one dont fit the bill dont misunderstand me i have no qualms about letting you stay in the stable and i could care less whether or not youre about what you say you are i just felt it prudent to give you fair warning youve caused no trouble here but watch your step one false move and they may rip you to shreds without a second thought
4953121 duly noted master gayle ill be sure to pass the word on to my companions
4953122 be sure that you do master dageron you seem like decent people and i would take no pleasure in hearing of your untimely demise id take even less pleasure in having to clean up the mess afterwards
4953123 just one thing do you know anything of lukas maerlon
4953124 supposedly hes at his statehouse on the other side of the the inner wall ive heard that hes aiding lord truhail in his efforts to find a cure for the sickness but if hes anything like his father im willing to bet that its all a ploy to increase his status out of our misery
4953125 ill get out of your way now youre a very busy man
4953126 must have been bad you look ready to murder someone
4953127 be still dain id rather wait until nehtalia comes back where is she anyway
4953128 i think she went to relieve herself now that you mention it though she has been gone quite a while
4953129 what in true gods name do you think you are doing
4953130 i told you what master gayle said i dont see how you can take this so lightly we have to find some place else to stay soon
4953131 what about this inner wall i only saw the one when we first arrived
4953132 many years ago the city was smaller and there an actual wall however the city has grown much in those many years and the wall was torn down and its bricks used on the one that surrounds the city now the inner wall now consists of building that once rested against the old wall there are very few alleys and only three entrances
4953133 ive considered that believe me but i dont believe it would be it isnt much different behind the inner wall except that the buildings are older and more cramped
4953134 is there a get it here or do you get that you arent even loving one another right now and how do we love your neighbors who are outside of the denomination tradition faith if you cant even lose your sisters and brothers on the other side of the table
4953135 what on earth are you in such a hurry for
4953136 that constellation is lupus she is the hunting wolf and there
4953137 nehtalia that means that we are less than a days trek from r thmishak were saved
4953138 there is somewhat more but i want to wait until dain knows at least where we are in some ways i think this has all been hardest on him
4953139 i mean i know it was the stone but how did we end up here why r thmishak
4953140 the stone showed me the face of lukas maerlon and there was a tugging feeling like we were being drawn together i think the stone was moving us to lukas or rather it was bringing lukas to me if im right then that means he is or at least was in
4953141 what you did back there was unacceptable mikel you could have killed us all and let the stone fall into anubis hands do you have any idea what horrors that would have foretold for all mankind
4953142 i dont agree with mikel using the stone any more than you do but the truth is hes saved us all if he hadnt used it then we would no doubt still be on that accursed beach with no food no water and no chance of making it this far alive
4953143 nehtalia is right dain i should never have taken such a foolish chance its no excuse that anubis manipulated my dreams and put me in such a compromising situation no excuse at all
4953144 is how you managed to get past the wards placed upon the stones case only those who placed them there and some chosen few among the cenoc should be able to break them how on earth did you manage
4953145 the wards against those with the intent of opening the box they are not lethal but i can not fathom how you managed to get past them as i said only a select few have the means to circumvent the various safeguards set upon it its beyond me why they did not stop you
4953146 the wards are renewed once a year mikel try to think is there anything at all you remember
4953147 there should have been others but perhaps they did not work because you were buffered from them by your dream it is hard to say without having a cenoc acolyte examine it
4953148 what does it mean if some of the wards are broken
4953149 it would be foolish to take it for granted that the wards are all intact if one is broken then others could be as well perhaps even some of those that bar anubis from obtaining the stone we must be very careful
4953150 i may not know anything about wards or things of that nature but i do know that we cant be too careful in a situation like this
4953151 what you did was dangerous and passing foolish mikel however i know of no other way in which we might have found safe egress from the dead forest it was damn fool luck that anubis did not wrest the stone from us but all that matters is that he did not
4953152 let our near loss be your only warning master dageron the stone is not a plaything nor is it a tool for meeting worldly ends it can and will destroy you if you touch it again i cant promise you that i will not have to kill you
4953153 now try to get some sleep we have an early morning and a long day ahead of us
4953154 neither do you human do you even know how to use what you hold
4953155 you cannot win i will have the stone and you will perish
4953156 do it the slap hadnt hurt but i was still shocked
4953157 i apologize nehtalia i dont know what came over me
4953158 come help me hes collapsed i fear it may be dehydration and we are running dangerously low on fresh water
4953159 we cant go on tonight not with dain in this condition maybe not for days oh mikel
4953160 i dont know how to do this family thing that far away with this many people

4953171 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence

4953174 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4953175 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4953180 in all matters constraint and compulsion are unbearable to me
4953181 to love at all is to be vulnerable love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken if you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give your heart to no one avoid all entanglements lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness but in that casket safe dark motionless airless it will change it will not be broken it will become unbreakable impenetrable irredeemable the alternative to tragedy or at least to the risk of tragedy is damnation the only place outside heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is hell

4953194 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4953195 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4953196 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4953197 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4953198 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4953199 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4953200 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4953201 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4953202 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4953203 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4953204 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4953205 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4953206 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4953207 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4953208 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4953209 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4953210 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4953211 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4953212 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4953213 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4953214 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away

4953223 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4953224 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4953225 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4953226 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

4953230 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4953231 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4953232 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4953233 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4953234 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4953235 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4953236 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4953237 tissue engineering is an exciting field were creating solutions to problems that can significantly impact peoples quality of life
4953238 these gels have great promise in not only regenerating bone but serving as a gene therapy delivery system
4953239 orang tidak boleh menggunakan masalah peribadi untuk berkempen tetapi kena lawan dasar antara pas dan umno
4953240 yang bawa cerita sumpah pada hari penamaan calon apa dia tidak ada cara lain lagi untuk berkempen
4953241 sumpah seperti itu letak kitab atas tangan adalah meniru amalan orang kristian ini karut
4953242 saya nak jumpa supaya umno tidak terus menerima islam separuh sahaja kerana jika umno tidak ada islam menjadi lebih baik di bawah pas
4953243 kerana muzakarah bukan hendak membincangkan mengenai kerusi atau kementerian tetapi bagaimana hendak berdepan allah di hari akhirat kelak
4953244 kalau kita sayang umno kita tarik orang melayu yang muda muda dalam umno supaya masuk pas tetapi orang tua orang kaya dan menteri biarlah di situ
4953245 i got on and sat my beautiful glutes in a row of two unused seats facing forward taking the window seat its a good thing too because a perfectly poundable asian pussy rested its lips on the seat next to me
4953246 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4953247 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4953248 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4953249 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4953250 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4953251 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4953252 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4953253 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4953254 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4953255 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4953256 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4953257 why do you guys not want me to join the fbi anyway
4953258 why dont you guys want me to go into the military or whatever
4953259 i can handle the truth you guys are stupid what are you talking about
4953260 its a lot of shit to break down and like were at a rave and shit you know just know that its coming from a good place your primos got your best interests at heart trust me hes just watching out for you we just want to make sure you consider all your options thats all
4953261 im freakin 0ut the fbi test is tuesday its d0wnt0wn by u
4953262 8 45 d0nt kn0w what t0 expect its bi0 data invent0ry l0gical reas0nin and fallacies 4 h0urs scared
4953263 dont worry u r smart plus u cant fail b c im counting on u to save my ass when they arrest me 4 being a dissident amp try to extradite me to black site 4 interrogation amp waterboarding
4953264 hang on sweetheart let me see what i can do for ya ill get ya something better
4953265 i hope thats in the black and i looked down well its in the black but its a pretty bad shot
4953266 the only thing i was thinking was just to calm myself down do the things id been doing on the last nine shots and relax and enjoy the shot
4953267 i did that of course i was a little bit more nervous than some of the previous shots but really in control i felt good about it
4953268 dude i got an olympic silver medal an olympic gold medal and i should have two more gold medals
4953269 he has a 3 3 lead and he shoots a shot that he never shoots its like the last olympics its something ridiculous that never happens and it happens on the last shot of the olympics
4953270 of course before this happened the story with me and katy was a big deal for anybody following the olympics and it was really good for shooting
4953271 if this is something that can get shooting on the map a little bit better and get people to understand it and realize that its out there i really cant complain about that i think thats good
4953272 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
4953273 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
4953274 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
4953275 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
4953276 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
4953277 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
4953278 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
4953279 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4953280 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4953281 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4953282 every time degeneres and de rossi visit de rossis family in australia their rights protections and status as a married couple will cease to exist
4953283 it is shameful that portia de rossis solemn marriage vows are dishonoured in this way by the government of her home country
4953284 winning an olympic gold medal youre the best at what you do in the world
4953285 you just cant describe what sarah and i have been through for the last four years and with us and pippa for the last two
4953286 we sat down back in october and said we wanted to come here and win this
4953287 we knew greece would come back we had to have a solid middle 1000m to make sure we crossed the line first and then it was a case of holding on and keeping going
4953288 yesterday the breeze was very light and i couldnt give the american guy any chance to get away from me
4953289 today i was more confident with my speed against his and my fitness
4953290 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
4953291 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
4953292 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
4953293 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
4953294 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
4953295 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
4953296 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4953297 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4953298 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4953299 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

4953302 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
4953303 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
4953304 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
4953305 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
4953306 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
4953307 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
4953308 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
4953309 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
4953310 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
4953311 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
4953312 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4953313 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4953314 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4953315 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4953316 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4953317 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4953318 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4953319 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4953320 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4953321 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4953322 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4953323 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4953324 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4953325 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4953326 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
4953327 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
4953328 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson

4953330 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me

4953337 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4953338 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4953339 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4953340 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4953341 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4953342 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4953343 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4953344 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4953345 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4953346 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4953347 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4953348 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4953349 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4953350 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said
4953351 russian peacekeepers osce observers south ossetian troops and the u
4953352 i can just hear mccain barnstorming the country in 08 denouncing russian imperialism and demanding that we stop putin in the caucasus before russian troops cross the bering straits

4953359 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4953360 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4953361 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4953362 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
4953363 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
4953364 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
4953365 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
4953366 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4953367 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
4953368 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
4953369 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills

4953440 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
4953441 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
4953442 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4953443 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4953444 il nexiste pas de lien de causalit lin aire et clair entre d mocratie et croissance
4953445 it doesnt matter how we win as long as we win because weve been scuffling
4953446 we have to pitch we have to play defense we have to base run we have to hit with runners in scoring position we have to work the starter to try to knock him out early
4953447 damon wasnt comfortable doing it i mean it is what it is
4953448 hes gotten some big hits for us already he can create some havoc he grinds out his at bats
4953449 each one of us is trying to pick each other up and it probably weighs on us
4953450 i used to joke with her that it was her knute rockne speech that she gave me
4953451 early in the count i was just looking to get a good pitch to hit and put some barrel on it and hit something hard
4953452 said gardner the eventual hero in the yanks 3 2 win over kansas city yesterday at yankee stadium
4953453 when he got to 3 2 i said theres a pretty good chance im going get a fastball to hit because hed rather face me than johnny he doesnt want to walk me
4953454 its not like youre down one run theres not any pressure if you get a hit everybody loves it and if not thats what weve been doing for the last eight innings anyway
4953455 it was a matter of pitching very well offensively and defensively we stunk
4953456 it felt a lot better than i expected i definitely got loose a lot quicker and it felt a lot easier
4953457 the crowd is chanting were number one the mets made up 15 games since the 13th of august lou brock is on second and vic davalillo the runner on first with one man out ninth inning 6 0 new york gentry pitching working hard here against joe torre now in the set position heres the pitch ground ball hit to shortstop harrelson to weis theres one first base double play the mets win its all over ohhh the roar going up from this crowd an unbelievable scene on the field fans are pouring out on the field
4953458 this is what we have done all year the bullpen has been pitching good it doesnt surprise me
4953459 we won thats the most important thing thats what we were looking for
4953460 you try to only use him in save situations but when youre at home the tie game is a save situation because if you score in the bottom there is no save situation
4953461 i saw the ball coming and i thought dont be an idiot and drop it
4953462 its going to be in a trophy case real soon
4953463 he was this kind of swagger i dont want to call it an aura when youre in the huddle
4953464 theres this sense that hes been doing this a long time and he knows what hes doing and hes going to throw you a good ball
4953465 the last two outings ive been making adjustments to get where i want to be
4953466 he kept them off balance got big outs when he needed to and threw a minimum of pitches that was impressive we need that type of effort going forward
4953467 i actually felt good to throw hard today but i just didnt need to
4953468 i would love to blow away people but thats not me anymore
4953469 ill take whatever i can get now and be happy
4953470 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4953471 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years thats a good thing
4953472 i ran and threw a little bit with the kids at the high school in his hometown in mississippi but theres no substitute for what we did tonight considering what i was doing 10 days ago i was pretty pleased to get the ball in the end zone
4953473 i wanted to play in it but i wanted to get it over with and kind of just go on i talked to offensive line coach bill callahan before the game he said the bottom line is having fun and i did i had a lot of fun
4953474 i had numerous people on the redskins say to me man it almost doesnt look right
4953475 but its got to start looking right it was a little awkward but i knew that we had to get that out of the way in order to get to where we want to be
4953476 he was able to move the team down the field and he made a nice throw to dustin keller it was a nice experience for dustin getting bretts first td pass
4953477 eric asked me how i felt i said hey id like to play a little bit more he said let me think about it and as he turned away he turned back and i thought about it youre out
4953478 i said you are nervous come on man you have played in super bowls
4953479 if you are expecting to play the same jets team from last year you are going to be in trouble
4953480 i think everybody was waiting on him to mess up or this to happen
4953481 man this is brett favre you can drop brett favre on mars and give him 10 other players and he can lead them to score a touchdown
4953482 they are going to be better with brett he is still going to win games
4953483 seit das weingut nicht mehr familienbesitz ist wurden die fr heren qualit ten nicht mehr erreicht es hat aber weiterhin h chste auszeichnungen erhalten
4953484 und dar ber l sst sich sicherlich trefflich streiten was die renommierten weinf hrer auch tun mal recht positiv mehr
4953485 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4953486 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4953487 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4953488 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4953489 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4953490 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4953491 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4953492 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4953493 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4953494 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4953495 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4953496 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4953497 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4953498 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4953499 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4953500 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4953501 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4953502 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4953503 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4953504 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4953505 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4953506 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4953507 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4953508 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4953509 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4953510 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
4953511 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
4953512 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
4953513 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
4953514 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
4953515 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4953516 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4953517 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4953518 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4953519 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4953520 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4953521 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4953522 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
4953523 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4953524 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4953525 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4953526 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4953527 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4953528 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4953529 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4953530 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4953531 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4953532 i couldnt have picked a better person to catch it from
4953533 hes the most legendary player in the nfl right now its just huge for me
4953534 i dont have one but i might build one for that ball
4953535 even after that drop i had to just keep on playing
4953536 i knew i was out there for the right reason
4953537 one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field like i did tonight i know i made the right decision
4953538 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4953539 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4953540 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4953541 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4953542 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4953543 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4953544 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4953545 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4953546 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4953547 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4953548 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4953549 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4953550 tipper phelps er mer glad i jason lezak enn mark spitz er
4953551 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4953552 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4953553 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4953554 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
4953555 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4953556 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4953557 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4953558 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4953559 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4953560 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4953561 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4953562 what do you want your look to say to people
4953563 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4953564 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4953565 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4953566 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4953567 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4953568 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4953569 violent extremist movements such as al qaeda and its associates
4953570 if only their technology had met our needs we could implement a whole new way of doing business
4953571 my wife family and god are all that keep me battling this some may use empty words to describe their reactions my words are not empty where my wife family and god are concerned you take it from there
4953572 i would heartily recommend the majority of the sites listed in my blogroll especially the one written by mr h
4953573 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4953574 this is where i learned to love the peasant the indigenous people and to admire their efforts to excel despite adverse conditions
4953575 here is a man who is showing that blindness is not the end of the world
4953576 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
4953577 weekends were for indulging our daughter spending time with her and enjoying watching a movie shopping and trying out a different restaurant each time
4953578 i have to cut corners now or i may not be able to pay back my loan before retirement
4953579 the boom of the last four years mesmerized them to live beyond their means
4953580 in the past ten weeks i am getting five to six new patients every week with financial worries about mortgages loan repayments and credit card bills all in the age group of 25 to 40 they exhibit anxiety helplessness and depression some even contemplate suicide
4953581 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4953582 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4953583 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4953584 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4953585 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
4953586 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
4953587 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
4953588 and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in clean linen cloth
4953589 i am ready and prepared to keep the commandment eat the afikoman for the sake of the g d and his presence may it be counted as done in the name of all israel
4953590 blessed art thou o lord our god king of the universe who brings forth bread from the earth
4953591 and they shall look upon him who they have pierced
4953592 if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto me

4953595 this was the whole point people like us had been pointing out that there were serious security problems with this thing for years we set out to show that were not just blowing smoke there really are security problems
4953596 citizens can get anything they want even auto but it is the government that has the power monopoly on automatics color of law if you live in arizona you can own a 105 howitzer and ammo if you want you can own a grenade launcher and live grenades you can own machine guns and silencers as well as rifles with under 16
4953597 sooner or later our president is going to say or do something that goes too far and then it will start
4953598 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4953599 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons

4953618 i was here a few days ago the night kevin died we slept right there on his bed
4953619 we needed to come back here anyways anna at least one more time
4953620 this room is where i actually met christian we had our first kiss on that couch
4953621 that was my room right there before i moved in with christian they didnt think it was safe for two sixteen year olds to live together without supervision but one could live on his own just fine
4953622 jace still lives here when hes not staying at the house
4953623 a necklace that i got from jaces mom i really need it now
4953624 well what does it look like maybe i could help you find it
4953625 whats so special about this necklace why do you need it now
4953626 she gave it to me a few days before they died told me that if i ever breakdown or just feel like im at the end of my rope hold it close and just remember that i have family it went through her family and she gave it to me
4953627 so can we leave now i love jace to death and back but this place seems kinda creepy now

4953641 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4953642 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4953643 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4953644 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4953645 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4953646 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4953647 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4953648 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4953649 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4953650 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4953651 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4953652 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4953653 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4953654 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4953655 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4953656 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4953657 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4953658 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4953659 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4953660 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4953661 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4953662 meg rom neked hogy mennyire szeretlek m g a sz vem dobog sohasem feledlek most messze vagyok t led messze t vol de a sz vem szeret s megtal l b rhol

4953664 our duty is to act decisively and make tax and spending decisions that show we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
4953665 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the higher earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
4953666 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4953667 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4953668 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4953669 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4953670 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
4953671 anna thank you for letting me push your baby in her stroller i had a fun day have fun in 2nd grade maybe you can come visit me in indy and we can go to the childrens museum or to conners prairie
4953672 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4953673 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4953674 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4953675 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4953676 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4953677 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4953678 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4953679 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4953680 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4953681 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4953682 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4953683 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4953684 obviously we have been concentrating on the game and since friday our minds have been on the game

4953720 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4953721 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4953722 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4953723 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4953724 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4953725 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4953726 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4953727 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4953728 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4953729 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4953730 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4953731 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4953732 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4953733 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4953734 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4953735 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4953736 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4953737 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4953738 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4953739 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4953740 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

4953757 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4953758 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4953759 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4953760 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4953761 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4953762 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4953763 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4953764 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4953765 voglio crederci che sia un bel film su x files
4953766 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4953767 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4953768 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4953769 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4953770 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4953771 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4953772 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4953773 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4953774 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4953775 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4953776 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4953777 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4953778 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4953779 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4953780 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4953781 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4953782 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4953783 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4953784 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4953785 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4953786 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4953787 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4953788 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4953789 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4953790 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4953791 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4953792 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4953793 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4953794 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4953795 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4953796 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4953797 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4953798 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4953799 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4953800 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4953801 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4953802 i wonder if our society is crippling itself by subjecting its youths to an almost darwinian college selection process
4953803 we have had diseases we never saw before the fighting
4953804 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4953805 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4953806 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4953807 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4953808 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4953809 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4953810 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4953811 pourquoi les gens intelligent prennent ils des d cisions idiotes
4953812 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4953813 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4953814 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4953815 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4953816 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4953817 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4953818 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4953819 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4953820 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4953821 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4953822 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4953823 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4953824 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4953825 when i started that job in 1999 the evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming seemed pretty good
4953826 the evidence was not conclusive but why wait until we were certain when it appeared we needed to act quickly
4953827 the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth
4953828 lord you can see all these mountains you know every stone and leaf and you know exactly where my contact lens is please help me
4953829 lord i dont know why you want me to carry this thing i cant eat it and its awfully heavy but if this is what you want me to do ill carry it for you
4953830 this is the type of individual who rebels against all forms of established law and is usually resistant to the pressures of authority like the conjunction it is an extremely touchy aspect and can even be violent with mars pluto or sun involved
4953831 a 1994 law protecting abortion clinics from anti choice terrorism in may 1994 the senate passed the legislation by a 69 30 margin and john mccain was among the cabal of anti choice senators who voted against the bill
4953832 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
4953833 they are very demanding as they are often bumpy and the street surface changes when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers anyway valencia will not be a complete street circuit there will be lots of run off areas for safety reasons the
4953834 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
4953835 therefore the game now becomes secondary and its difficult to talk about it
4953836 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4953837 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4953838 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4953839 i am not sure i am just showing iwb files
4953840 ive really enjoyed every minute of my olympic sailing career im very lucky

4953890 ive seen magazines where plastic surgeons are saying if you want a butt like this it has to be fake
4953891 im just like dude have you ever seen an armenian girl before
4953892 reminds me of cottage cheese inside a big trash bag
4953893 she called and apologized and i accepted her apology she said she was joking i kind of laugh it off like you know ive never denied having cellulite everyones entitled to their own opinion if she thinks my butt looks like that i dont really care
4953894 i hadnt said a word to her or touched her
4953895 when i was 12 and had crushes on guys id put my first name with their last name but it never sounded right
4953896 she also says she was shocked to be named one of peoples 100 most beautiful people this year
4953897 if people call me a lesbian because i have short hair and i wear jeans instead of dresses then by all means run with it i think its hilarious i like guys
4953898 did someone tell you im going through a hard time
4953899 its tragic everyone in jimmys circle said that when he finally realized how hed let sarah slip through his fingers the girl he found so beautiful sexy funny and wonderful to his two kids hed go nuts
4953900 jimmy whos crazy competitive got a little bigheaded about moving out of the late night ghetto into an earlier slot if jay leno joins abc and started ignoring sarah
4953901 like sarahs a busy star in her own right but when shed come home to jimmy ready for romance hed be hanging with frat boy pals like adam sandler and adam carolla
4953902 jimmy keeps saying he just wants to talk sarahs stopped taking his calls saying whys he doing this it was his decision to end it sarahs known for flipping the switch when shes ready to move on
4953903 he has the personality of a fighter pilot when somebody stings you you want to strike out
4953904 just like the american people his reaction was show me somebody to hit
4953905 at present we do not have title insurance companies in india but the same technique can be employed by banks and financial institutions and housing finance companies in association with the state governments
4953906 as per current thinking railway land is to be given to developers for real estate india
4953907 with the launch of chloris the residential project in faridabad we made our presence in market of the north we are coming up with a similar project in delhi spread over 17 acres
4953908 we would be expanding in a phased manner initially the funding would be primarily through internal accruals its only when we go about de veloping the land further we may resort to loans and private equity

4953912 what the amp are you parents doing sending your kids to see these movies in the first place
4953913 love energy is never lost it only changes from one form to another
4953914 many including an estimated 1 600 children pick through the garbage all day and when the sun sets many pull out headlamps and pick all night
4953915 we spent our days teaching the children at the organization and surveying and documenting the families at the dump despite our initial preconceptions the people were not as harsh as their surroundings but rather warm funny and inviting their resilience changed our entire outlook on life and as a result we wanted to share them with the world
4953916 the best laid plans of mice and men go oft astray
4953917 every time degeneres and de rossi visit de rossis family in australia their rights protections and status as a married couple will cease to exist
4953918 it is shameful that portia de rossis solemn marriage vows are dishonoured in this way by the government of her home country
4953919 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4953920 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4953921 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4953922 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4953923 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4953924 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4953925 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4953926 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4953927 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4953928 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4953929 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4953930 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4953931 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4953932 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4953933 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4953934 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4953935 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4953936 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4953937 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4953938 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4953939 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4953940 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4953941 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4953942 mika du bist gut in den saisonendspurt gestartet und dein motorrad sieht stark aus hat dein team irgendwelche wichtigen updates gebracht
4953943 unser technischer direktor harald bartol hat einige neue zylinder mitgebracht sowie die steuerung f r die motorenelektronik verbessert ich habe diese upgrades auf beiden motorr dern ausprobiert und beide f hlten sich toll an nat rlich ist es schwierig unsere jetzige lage mit dem zustand von vor der sommerpause zu vergleichen es gab einige wochen ohne training und rennen da wei man dann nicht mehr alles ganz genau wenn es einen unterschied gibt dann ist der n mlich sehr gering
4953944 wichtig ist aber dass wir wohl in der lage sind mit aprilia mitzuhalten ich hatte die gelegenheit mit einigen aprilia piloten zu fahren und alles sieht danach aus dass unsere performance recht hnlich ist unser aggregat war sogar schon beim vergangenen rennen am sachsenring konkurrenzf hig und jetzt haben wir einen weiteren schritt nach vorne gemacht in richtung aprilia wir haben aufgeholt und das ist prima f r dieses wochenende sieht alles gut aus wir haben keine probleme was das chassis betrifft so benutzen wir dieselbe spezifikation wie am sachsenring unser basissetup f r diese strecke ist schon recht gut wir probieren lediglich eine andere gabelbr cke aus um zu sehen ob wir uns weiter verbessern k nnen
4953945 du hast in der meisterschaft lange gef hrt ehe marco simoncelli an dir vorbeigegangen ist was f r ein gef hl hast du f r das saisonfinale
4953946 das wird sicherlich f r alle sehr aufregend speziell nat rlich f r die fahrer sicherlich h tte ich den ersten platz in der meisterschaft vor der sommerpause gerne behalten wollen aber wir konnten am sachsenring einfach nicht mehr bringen mehr als p4 war dort nicht drin ich war nach dem rennen etwas entt uscht aber jetzt habe ich wieder ein gutes gef hl ich freue mich sehr wieder zur ck auf der strecke zu sein und es ist wichtig dass wir von der ersten trainingssitzung an gut dabei sind man sollte zum saisonstart immer gleich ein gutes ergebnis einfahren das gibt n mlich ein gutes gef hl f r die weiteren rennen nach der pause sind wir jetzt in einer hnlichen lage sollten wir hier gut abschneiden dann wird es gewiss leichter diesen schwung in die kommenden rennen mitzunehmen
4953947 denkst du dass simoncellis erfolg deinem team eine zus tzliche motivation verliehen hat
4953948 jeder hier im team wei dass wir zu jeder zeit 100 prozent geben m ssen und alle haben bislang wirklich alles gegeben das trifft auch f r mich zu jedes mal wenn ich auf die strecke gehe dann hole ich stets das maximum aus mir heraus es macht keinen unterschied dass wir nun zweiter in der meisterschaft sind jeder im team will unsere mitbewerber schlagen und zur ck an die spitze gelangen wir machen also mit demselben schwung und elan weiter wie bisher auch
4953949 was sind die schw chen von simoncelli wie kannst du ihn schlagen
4953950 in den vergangenen f nf rennen waren er und sein team sehr stark f r den moment sieht es danach aus als h tten sie nicht sonderlich viele schwachstellen der schl ssel um sie zu schlagen ist eine menge harter arbeit wenn wir schw chen entdecken wollen dann m ssen wir uns vielleicht zur ckerinnern wie er im vergangenen jahr und im jahr davor abgeschnitten hat da hat er viele unf lle gebaut in dieser saison hatte kaum st rze wenn wir aber den druck auf ihn im saisonendspurt aufrechterhalten k nnen dann macht er vielleicht wieder mehr fehler unser plan ist also ihn unter druck zu setzen immer und berall
4953951 wie hast du dich auf den letzten teil der saison vorbereitet hast du entspannt oder trainiert
4953952 ich habe in der sommerpause viel relaxt wir waren eine woche lang in urlaub in lappland ich bin an einen see gegangen zum angeln habe meine freunde besucht und zeit mit meiner familie verbracht aber nat rlich muss jeder auf diesem wettbewerbslevel einiges an sport treiben um fit zu bleiben ich bin viel mit dem fahrrad unterwegs gewesen und bin auch supermoto gefahren jetzt sieht alles blendend aus ich bin in form habe ein ausgezeichnetes gef hl mit dem bike und kann es kaum erwarten wieder rennen zu fahren
4953953 gaan we ook een filmscript schrijven en keiveel geld verdienen met dikke zever
4953954 its deserted no one lives here lets go in and get some food
4953955 asking rose west to open a halfway house for young runaways
4953956 people in the moral gutter cannot take the moral high ground
4953957 tibetans now suffer the double horror of being ruled by undemocratic chinese officials on one hand and demeaned by the dalai lama and his western supporters on the other
4953958 chinese peoples material lives are improving let us hope their political lives rapidly improve too
4953959 so are you now actually in the pay of the chinese communist party you unbelievable bastard
4953960 i think we can go to stamford bridge and upset them
4953961 last season we played chelsea in my first game for portsmouth and i thought we were the better side of course it will be hard now they are going to be buzzing with a new manager but we are buzzing too
4953962 its not an easy place to go to but we can take a lot of good things from the community shield last week
4953963 if we can go there and work hard like we did against manchester united then i think we can get a result
4953964 we can improve attacking wise from last week but we defended really well then and need to do that again
4953965 ive played with crouchie a few times and we have a natural understanding but a lot of the boys have not played with him before so it will take a while for others to get used to him
4953966 but everyone is working hard and it will pay off sooner rather than later
4953967 even in pre season its always important to be scoring goals as a striker
4953968 it helps to build confidence and i will be looking to take that into the season
4953969 its not a bottomless pit we cant expect the owner to keep funding it but its hard when you have to sell top players
4953970 thats the way the game is and its a fact that chelsea look an even stronger side now for scolari hes inherited a team of world class players and a few more have been added like deco and jose bosingwa who will both be big stars in england
4953971 a team like that can rip you to pieces if you are not careful and we have to find a way to stop them
4953972 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4953973 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4953974 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4953975 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4953976 listen very carefully see that tree over there the one with the really tempting fruit dont eat the fruit you kids got that if youre hungry theres plenty of other good stuff around but dont eat that fruit got it
4953977 the soil will be cursed because of you genesis 3 17
4953978 will produce accursed things for you such as flies fleas and ants
4953979 the fly has been endowed by its creator perhaps as a counter balance to its unpopularity with uncanny tenacity
4953980 god in his wisdom made the fly and then forgot to tell us why
4953981 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4953982 i went to see her at crystal palace in the london grand prix and she was immense that day in her performance to win the race
4953983 that day at crystal palace she ran a four minute eight seconds race which is good but i felt she needed to jump to the next level which she did the following week by running a four minute flat
4953984 i think there is every chance for lisa to come back with a medal from the games it is early in her career and these occasions can make or break you but i have every faith in lisa to do well after her season this year she should regard herself as a major contender
4953985 lisa really understands how races are run and has that awareness of when to push in the pack lisa won the gold at the commonwealth games i was there when she did that and it was not a fast race
4953986 the fact is in olympic finals the races are not always very fast in time but are very tactical and lisa has the head on her shoulders to deal with that and pick the right time
4953987 the olympics is another completely different competition and you have to treat it that way lisa will have to keep her feet on the ground which can be very difficult to do at your first games i have seen lisa and i think she has the head to deal with the occasion i think she will be happy to make the final but in finals anything can happen
4953988 there are not enough words to describe the feeling lisa will be going through firstly the nerves will hit you which is quite terrifying but you have to put that to the back of your mind stepping out into the stadium with the crowd is amazing it is one of the best experiences in athletics
4953989 then there is pressure and expectation on you to perform as a potential medallist which lisa will have to deal with it is a great experience which she will definitely learn from
4953990 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

4953992 100 000 gratiskondomer har delats ut i os byn ett uppskattat initiativ
4953993 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4953994 this is a planning took where all things are going
4953995 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4953996 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4953997 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4953998 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4953999 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4954000 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4954001 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4954002 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4954003 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4954004 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4954005 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4954006 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4954007 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4954008 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4954009 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4954010 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4954011 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4954012 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4954013 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4954014 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4954015 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4954016 une nouvelle libert aux femmes en cr ant un style m lant le f minin au masculin dont lembl me est le smoking
4954017 this was the whole point people like us had been pointing out that there were serious security problems with this thing for years we set out to show that were not just blowing smoke there really are security problems
4954018 it was more out of interest its completely standard technology i just got the data to see what format it was in
4954019 i dont know if our results were surprising its been known for a long time security people have said this is not a great way of doing things we just did a proof of concept
4954020 its as much a mental game as a physical one
4954021 its the cn tower and the toronto skyline that never seem to get any bigger and your mind begins to play tricks on you
4954022 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4954023 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4954024 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4954025 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4954026 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4954027 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4954028 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4954029 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4954030 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4954031 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4954032 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4954033 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4954034 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4954035 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4954036 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4954037 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4954038 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4954039 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4954040 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4954041 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4954042 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4954043 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4954044 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4954045 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4954046 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4954047 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4954048 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4954049 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4954050 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4954051 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4954052 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4954053 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4954054 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4954055 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4954056 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4954057 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4954058 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4954059 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4954060 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4954061 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4954062 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4954063 ik weet eigenlijk niet wat ik hier zoek maar vind het toch wel leuk type
4954064 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4954065 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4954066 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4954067 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4954068 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4954069 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4954070 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4954071 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4954072 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4954073 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional

4954082 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
4954083 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4954084 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4954085 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4954086 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4954087 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4954088 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies that is my commitment
4954089 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4954090 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
4954091 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington
4954092 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4954093 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4954094 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4954095 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4954096 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4954097 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
4954098 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared
4954099 i also work really hard choosing my words very carefully to avoid being bulky and heavy handed
4954100 i dont like all those words like wiser or mature or reflective
4954101 i couldnt give you a well rounded phrase on how i feel now versus 15 years ago i know that im more interested in saying certain things because i do believe if you say things you can make them true if i sing a line like something good this way comes its because a i believe it and b i need to keep believing it but its not motivational speaking there is dark there is light and its important to have it all represented
4954102 when you hold an acoustic guitar people think you are being very confessional
4954103 i feel quite the opposite not just with this record but in general i didnt have anything about myself that i necessarily wanted to say these were my thoughts a paternally nasal emphasis breaks through his carefully calibrated west coast drawl but if you were curious about me i dont think youd learn much from these songs

4954105 its not conducive to writing good material with people who care about that stuff the stretch that theyre willing to go to analyse my songs is astounding at times its become a game of outwitting each other or proving they can draw six degrees of kevin bacon nothing im going to do will stop that process but its not entertainment for me in the rest of my life i dont see it or hear about it though so it doesnt matter
4954106 profound impact on popular music and american culture marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power
4954107 your dad writes of it being impossible now for me to observe anything without being observed a heck of a position for a writer to be in but havent you been observed all your life
4954108 its something im aware of but its something i dont have any interest in any more if youd asked me that 10 years ago i might have had a different answer if youre talking in a familial sense of where i come from without any hesitation without any bitterness without any regrets i couldnt care any less about that at this point i choose to believe that the interest in my songs arises because ive been a songwriter for 15 years
4954109 i dont know what the word is to describe how i may have behaved but people were less kind and i was never going to be a tool for anybody people always have an easy time mistaking quietude for arrogance
4954110 first i dont make it my business to give anybody career advice and second i will certainly not give him any because hes busy doing that by example for most of us anyway his experience is invaluable and i have the ability to get information about that stuff but any advice he gives publicly is in the book which he was paid for anything that goes beyond that im thinking of charging
4954111 when i write mine i wont ask anybody for permission either did people find it like insightful
4954112 well at least thats the effort of the book and thats why i hesitate to say too much because hes still busy weaving whatever web he wants to weave t how to be real good at it
4954113 at the same time im not sweating about how important i am ive never worried too much about being inventive or original those are just nonsensical words to me when making art i feel like i come in a long line of traditionalists that im a team player and i serve a good purpose
4954114 it doesnt give people any value to know about that its used for voyeuristic ends
4954115 currently demonstrates what we consider to be significant weaknesses and has also failed some of the basic tests that we use to identify fiscal stability therefore even in a favorable economic environment it is our opinion that depositors or creditors could incur significant risks

4954131 if men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury the offender must be fined whatever the womans husband demands and the court allows but if there is serious injury you are to take life for life

4954172 my phone has been red hot with people ringing to express interest in creating a locally based consortium that would bring radio back to the region
4954173 we already have the financing in place to handle the business elements of an offer and i am totally confident the stations would make money
4954174 it will be brilliant to recreate stations in the midlands that dominated the market 25 years ago
4954175 most of gcaps 71 local stations across the uk do not compete with global for the same audiences or advertisers
4954176 however advertisers trying to reach a regional radio audience in the east midlands had a prime choice between airtime on globals heart regional station or a region wide package of airtime based on local gcap stations
4954177 similar circumstances applied in the west midlands where chrysalis also owned galaxy the divestment remedies in the midlands are about restoring competition to make sure customers will not be harmed
4954178 no realistic prospect of harm to london advertisers or listeners
4954179 global will have to continue to compete hard against its closest competitor bauer as well as others such as virgin smooth and for audience the bbc
4954180 the oft expects the deal to generate significant efficiencies that will benefit advertisers and listeners for example by delivering cheaper prices for multi station advertising packages and programming changes capable of attracting larger and more focused radio audiences thereby enhancing rivalry in the london market
4954181 we are pleased that the oft has made the final decision in this case and that there will be no referral to the competition commission
4954182 securing the fa cup and international matches completes radio fivelives unrivalled portfolio of football commentary rights including the premier league the bbc believes its important we offer free to air live coverage of key sporting events
4954183 the bbc is under no pressure to publish how much it spends on rights and that is absolutely outrageous i understand the bbc spends almost as much on premier league radio rights as talksports entire turnover and that is not a level playing field at all

4954218 the topic of forgiveness is always an interesting one there are so many perceptions on what forgiveness looks like and the why behind it its a topic that fascinates me because our example of what forgiveness looks like is found in christ we are called to forgive because he forgives us unforgiveness keeps us from connecting with god fully we hold onto something that is his to handle but we think that it doesnt prevent us from fully loving god our relationship with him is why we forgive our trust that he has it under control is most often the motivation in return we are blessed with a peace that can only come from him
4954219 i was just thinking how proud i am to be canadian

4954225 canada is delighted to see them standing tall on the podium with the worlds best athletes
4954226 we are extremely proud of canadas olympic team competing in beijing each day our athletes exhibit dignity respect and dedication to their sport and to their country
4954227 i thought we played well and hit hard but unfortunately we could not find the holes
4954228 they made some big plays and we just could not get any runs across
4954229 i mean i knew i could ride a top eight if i rode a good race for me but if i rode a perfect race it would be a top five
4954230 we played well three of the four quarters but greece scored five goals in the first
4954231 we cant give up such a big lead in an olympic tournament
4954232 i feel a little bit bitter but i did my best and i dont have any excuse because i tried hard
4954233 as soon as i saw i had covered the field and i knew i would win i was very happy and i started to celebrate

4954255 all those who want to live in a healthy equal society should vote for the socialist alliance
4954256 the socialist alliance shares the ideology for which i fought all my life people before profit and for peoples right to have a better future
4954257 by standing we are going to open the door for other political refugees to participate fully in political life as australian citizens
4954258 as a migrant or as a refugee from the so called third world we can feel the heavy hand of racism in blacktown especially from the police and from those who still live in the era of the white australia policy
4954259 we have some very highly qualified people from overseas in blacktown working as security guards and cleaners meanwhile australia is importing people from britain or the us to work here as nurses or doctors we have to establish a way that these peoples qualifications will be recognised
4954260 there are very few jobs and the jobs that are available are very marginal ones instead of studying to get better qualifications people are forced to work in jobs which are not going to give blacktown a very bright future
4954261 the government is doing nothing to provide lower cost housing
4954262 the average price of a two bedroom flat is around 220 and this is really very high if somebody has only 300 each fortnight particularly for pensioners and single parents
4954263 they teach them how to act in australia but they dont teach them the language they will need to work with
4954264 there are many young families in blacktown and there are not enough places in public or community childcare this forces families to search of private childcare which is very expensive centrelink is helping but the lack of childcare places is still a major barrier for the families
4954265 we have to create places where they can enjoy themselves by learning and playing at the same time
4954266 over the last year many small businesses have been bankrupted because they cannot compete with the westpoint shopping centre
4954267 instead of concentrating all the shops in the one place westpoint and main street we need more shops in the suburbs such as doonside and rooty hill

4954271 in the asian community there is a broad interest in precious metals and gold
4954272 in the past in times of crisis the fate of banks are uncertain but the value of gold is reliable gold is a symbol of prestige and a portable method of carrying wealth
4954273 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4954274 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4954275 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4954276 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4954277 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4954278 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4954279 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4954311 with her guidance mentoring and teaching i was able to become a semi literate council member she was fabulous in every meaning of the word

4954313 why is a librarian any more unlikely a hero than a teacher a reporter a banker or any number of other professions whose jobs involve similar levels of education and risk
4954314 if youve been in many libraries you probably know that librarians come in all shapes sizes ages and personalities just like everyone else please dont perpetuate the tired old stereotype of librarians as shushing middle aged spinsters who couldnt possibly be as observant and quick thinking as people in professions you consider more exciting

4954321 i felt the need with everything going on with the city to add the position to coordinate all the things going on
4954322 i dont think harry is in the 250 000 bracket
4954323 i agree that if he had a lot of responsibility in the private sector he would earn that much but with the results he has gotten i dont think he would stay in the private sector
4954324 i like harry but he is a part of a system
4954325 he is doing something that i dont think my money or my taxes should be paying for this whole system is feeding corporate welfare
4954326 the real question is why arent they going to the market to see if they can make a deal work subsidy free the county got dozens of developers to propose on the fairgrounds through a competitive process
4954327 the animal shelter does not have the ability or the personnel to examine and clean up all those cats
4954328 people created this situation and we need the publics help to solve it
4954329 i cant say how this is going to come out but were trying to find homes for as many of the cats as we can
4954330 the facility would be open to the public so people could some in and select cats and kittens they want to foster or adopt
4954331 but if we dont practice you get what you get
4954332 when i married 37 years ago there was nothing about santa in the contract

4954335 im sorry to take your time but i just have to say how very worried we both are about the way the government is prying into everybodys lives we feel that were slowly losing all our privacy

4954338 they fight about anything really toys attention couch space tv shows my goal is to keep them busy and tire em out
4954339 it just kind of came from there personally i dont really get tired of summer
4954340 im ready for them to get back to their regular routine and do some learning
4954341 god he must have gone through hell in his personal life to have dropped such a long way
4954342 he was quiet soft spoken and well respected he was not a bum
4954343 it was one of varians great successes wayne was a great mentor very helpful to me and he was doing really great stuff
4954344 what kind of choices did he make to go from the penthouse to the outhouse
4954345 gek h dat je na zo fietstocht met veel zweten toch nog moet pissen
4954346 hij noemt zichzelf de onzinnige dichter maar of die naam werkelijk van toepassing is op de gedichten die hij voor deze bundel geschreven heeft is nog maar de vraag vanwege de veelzijdigheid van de gedichten zal een ieder er wel iets uit kunnen halen wat hem haar raakt of aanspreekt vele aspecten uit het dagelijkse leven worden aangehaald en verwoord op een soms donkere soms humoristische absurde wijze kortom ik clown is een bundel voor iedereen die houdt van een mengeling van droge zwarte humor de alledaagse gang van zaken en gedachten die mensen veelal niet openlijk durven uitroepen
4954347 i would take her to the local hospitals and they could never figure out what was wrong with her other than saying that she had the flu or a viral infection
4954348 as time went on the sicker she got tina would help out around the house it was nice to have the extra hand but after a while it got on our nerves because it was like we didnt have any privacy
4954349 what did i ever do to make tina think that she ever had a chance to be romantically involved with me
4954350 this election really matters and i wanted to be involved
4954351 i come from the business side with a little more structure
4954352 hes has contended very publicly with the same issues as i have privately
4954353 im not going to wear a funny hat thats all i know
4954354 i went from world of warcraft to world of obamacraft
4954355 our players are ready for a major tournament were simply missing everything else that goes with it finnish football isnt where it needs to be yet theres still a lot of development to do
4954356 it is vacation season now in america and the town is usually quiet between july and september but we still get as many customers as before thanks to the beijing olympic games
4954357 there were so many people here last night to watch womens gymnastic all round most of them were girls they like gymnastics
4954358 he will get the 8th gold and set a new record in olympic history
4954359 i have been trying to watch olympics as much as i can so do my family and friends if i miss the live broadcasting i will turn on the radio to get the result
4954360 i love baseball but it is olympic time now i have to make the choice and tonight i am here for the olympics
4954361 chinese athletes have been doing really well yang wei deserved the gold in mens gymnastic all round and weve gonna watch liu xiang as well and chinese basketball played strong they have yao ming
4954362 but with the track and field kicking off soon the u s will catch up
4954363 every time degeneres and de rossi visit de rossis family in australia their rights protections and status as a married couple will cease to exist
4954364 it is shameful that portia de rossis solemn marriage vows are dishonoured in this way by the government of her home country
4954365 willen we naar het binnenhof dan gaan we naar het binnenhof
4954366 i helped so many in 2005 when katrina hit this great town via that exact commentary and i have in place a program that truly is going to redefine standards for entrepreneurs that are intent on taking complete control of their career path
4954367 from profiling and identifying customers with specfic requirements for efficiency improvements to consulting on equipment maintenance i have covered the entire scope of helping clients achieve full operating capacity
4954368 and im very thankful for this period of my life i have a great company with great support which provides stability that is rare in todays society i told my wife that every man has a new phase that he encounters which presents needed challengesand with the rollout of my new business model she smiled gave me a hug and told me to create as much success as i have created during the past 30 years
4954369 the home based industry has a new person enrolling every 11 seconds
4954370 and the problem for most is being introduced into outdated marketing concepts that create failure in a short period of time i have a model in place http thegoldentickets net that is totally automated and does all the marketing work that addresses the needed details as far as explaining the products company and the business opportunity studies show over 40 000 000 folks are looking to make a living from their home my system allows entrepreneurs to use modern technology to do all the prospecting which facilitates contacting highly qualified prospects who have gone through our system and are looking to move forward and become part of the team
4954371 over 100 million dollars poured into research has created a product that will help humans live longer and defeat diabetes and heart disease
4954372 barbara walters did an interview that outlined this concept http video yahoo com watchfr yvmtf amp v 3256197 and the discovery is based on a protein in the body which controls the aging process the excitement from a few years ago about the effects of red wine on this issue has been simplified in a product offering that will truly change the entire life scope imagine being 80 years old and having the body effects of a 50 year old that defines what this product does and is why i have entered into the entrepreneurial phase of my life that has me so excited
4954373 the reality right now is that the word security is no longer in play and people need to find an outlet to bring that back into play
4954374 a great marketing concept tied around a product that everyone will need makes this an incredible situation throw in a compensation program that is geared toward immediate payouts along with long term residual income and it is easy to see why my home office is working overtime to keep up with inquiries new orleans is a great town that is on the way back this program is a great program that is on the way to the top

4954380 creo que vamos a tener todas las facilidades para poder llevar a cabo esa reforma y se cumpla el requisito de reciprocidad y que los inmigrantes que hay en nuestro pa s puedan votar

4954383 nosotros nos comprometimos con el tribunal a anunciar en 45 d as la nueva ubicaci n de migron este asentamiento ser reconstruido en tierras comunales en la regi n y se convertir en un barrio de una colonia existente
4954384 el gobierno capitul ante las amenazas de los colonos de usar la violencia si eran evacuados a pesar de que ocupan ilegalmente tierras privadas palestinas
4954385 no aceptamos ese regalo a los colonos que obtienen en compensaci n por su acci n ilegal la construcci n de una nueva colonia
4954386 migron fue constituida en forma fraudulenta sobre tierras privadas arrebatadas a los palestinos sin embargo los mismos colonos que violaron la ley ven que su acci n es avalada

4954394 immerhin haben wir den rzten viel geld f r einen sohn bezahlt jetzt aber haben wir eine zus tzliche b rde durch die tochter
4954395 ich habe keine zweifel daran dass alle stimmen unserer landtagsfraktion da sein werden
4954396 das programm f r das frau ypsilanti steht ist ein klassisches sozialdemokratisches programm

4954404 solange er zur agenda 2010 steht ist hopfen und malz verloren
4954405 i have really grown up with madonna i have always admired her i think she is an extremely strong character as we are the same age i think my tastes have changed in a similar fashion to hers i have enjoyed listening to everything she has done
4954406 like a virgin was the first song i was hooked on i remember going out in my 20s and me and my friends dancing around our handbags to it it was played everywhere
4954407 she has always been controversial she never played the safe option when she brought out that sex book i wasnt sure about that but she has always pushed herself to the very limits of everything she has done
4954408 i have got three children two of them teenage girls they have a different view of her to me they think shes too old to do what shes doing i think they find it quite embarrassing when i get up and dance around the kitchen to her
4954409 the only thing i dont approve of in her is her weight ive read that she doesnt eat more than 1 000 calories a day i dont think thats a very healthy way to live the pressure on her to stay thin must be enormous there are a lot of younger children out there who look at that example
4954410 but to still be there at the top of the charts at 50 is some achievement i do think its something for other women of her age to aspire to it shows we can still be out there making our marks its not the end of the road when you turn 50
4954411 madonnas figure has a bit too much muscle and sinew which doesnt necessarily look good on women that age i saw her in concert in 1985 on her blonde bombshell tour and i thought she looked great then
4954412 i think people have become a bit cynical as to how shes achieved that figure i read that she works out for four hours a day isnt that a bit fanatical plus she has the staff and the people to help her achieve that
4954413 i think she must be quite obsessive about it which is not necessarily a good thing i suspect that it may be to do with the fact that she cant accept growing older she doesnt seem to be relaxed about the whole thing
4954414 in terms of her style i do think its amazing the way she has constantly reinvented herself but im not sure that she is well physically i think she needs a bit more flesh on her it might be a sign of her insecurities that she works so hard to look good
4954415 i am just a few months older than her people say i look younger than i am but a lot of the people that i help train dont want a figure like madonnas they dont think her look is attractive she looked great throughout her 30s and 40s its only in recent years that shes begun to look old
4954416 as someone who has recently turned 50 i can say i feel a lot more relaxed and confident about things now which is how madonna should try and feel it seems like such an old age to be im sure turning 50 wont hold madonna back from whatever she wants to do
4954417 im a massive madonna fan i grew up listening to her songs my first ever album was the immaculate collection it was scratched to pieces i listened to it so much i grew up in the late 80s and early 90s when she was ruling the world with her music and style
4954418 she is definitely my style icon i love the way she reinvents herself she is always on the edge of fashion and emerging trends she is exceptional to be always on the curve rather than following others thats amazing
4954419 i love her personal style she really puts her stamp on everything she does she directs the style team rather than the other way around its amazing to think that i will be helping to create the vision she has decided for her dancers and i will be carrying out her instructions
4954420 my favourite song ever is vogue and express yourself the music videos were so powerful
4954421 she always has strong fashion links to people like vivienne westwood she links music and fashion so well nowadays lots of stars have strong ties in fashion but she was the first one
4954422 she was definitely my fashion inspiration growing up its great how 80s fashion has come back around and now we are all wearing the clothes that madonna perfected all those years ago i wear fingerless gloves and tutus and vintage t shirts just like she did i dont think she will ever be too old
4954423 madonna has relied on her youthful image to be a success
4954424 she is the mistress of reinvention it will be interesting to see how her image develops now she has reached her birthday milestone i cant see her packing in her career shell be carrying on much like mick jagger is
4954425 being in your 50s is the new 30s older stars are making successes of their careers tina turner is still touring at 70 actress helen mirren looks fabulous they are examples of people ageing a bit more gracefully
4954426 there are rumours that madonna has had botox to keep herself looking young but no treatment can hide all the tell tale signs of ageing such as your hands and feet
4954427 whats more i dont think it looks as if madonna is enjoying herself any more i think shes quite a mixed up girl whenever she is pictured she looks miserable
4954428 trata se de um gesto e de uma passagem para reconstruir a confian a uma tentativa para fortalecer os moderados na anp e o processo de paz
4954429 every time degeneres and de rossi visit de rossis family in australia their rights protections and status as a married couple will cease to exist

4954434 la ordenaci n de las mujeres es el paso primero para recomenzar la comunidad de iguales que quer a jes s la iglesia se empobrece clamorosamente por la carencia de una aportaci n femenina m s plena y responsable
4954435 el mal no reconocido de la iglesia cat lica es el autoritarismo la falta de democracia interna y el rechazo a la libertad de pensamiento
4954436 lo ltimo que har el papa ser aceptar el sacerdocio femenino
4954437 desde que el s nodo de la iglesia de inglaterra anglicana acept la ordenaci n de mujeres el 11 de noviembre de 1992 muchos fieles disconformes con esa decisi n se est n pasando a la iglesia de roma
4954438 no les gusta que las chicas empiecen de monaguillos porque saben que algunas terminar n aspirando al sacerdocio
4954439 con las alas cortadas y como una hija abortada de la iglesia
4954440 si ya tenemos dos mamas para qu queremos un papa
4954441 colocarse al margen supondr a dejar a la iglesia en manos de los legionarios de cristo
4954442 aunque no queremos cismas debemos rebelarnos contra las estructuras antidemocr ticas de la iglesia

4954445 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defence shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
4954446 it is really unfortunate that russia chooses to react by putting nuclear warheads in different places if indeed it does that when the rest of the world is not looking at some kind of old fashioned superpower conflict
4954447 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
4954448 im endeffekt war der selbst auferlegte druck zu gro grundmangel war die schwache torausbeute

4954450 this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing swimming
4954451 too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one
4954452 u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq
4954453 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4954454 the u s administration is stumbling in the middle east without considering any horizons for the future
4954455 it is totally obsessed with the idea of its war against terrorism and this makes it lose even in the simplest political sense
4954456 the u s administration has done more harm to its allies in georgia and the middle east than to its enemies
4954457 bush did not realize that by intervening heavily in other countries affairs he would give the same right to other players
4954458 the u s had no problem to interfere and separate provinces from bigger states like it did with kosovo
4954459 this is exactly what russia is doing now intervening to prevent the annexation of certain provinces to georgia russia is using the same logic that the u s used
4954460 in iraq we were dealing with a fascist government which was hated by all iraqis because of the suffering that was inflicted on them
4954461 saddam husseins regime threatened regional stability and made war with neighboring countries
4954462 why should bush care what russia does to georgia unless he or his administration has an interest in the issue to start with
4954463 the news is saying that the americans trained the georgians and apparently wanted them to join nato i cant blame the russians for doing what theyre doing theres a threat in their immediate vicinity and they decided to take care of it
4954464 our duty is to act decisively and make sure we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
4954465 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
4954466 yes protect those on the lowest incomes but also help the hard working middle classes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor the people who work long hours for their two holidays a year leisure club membership meals out with family and friends and ability to buy their children nice things
4954467 with the benefit of hindsight it is painfully clear the countdown to september 11 to the terrorist bombings in london and madrid and to the grisly islamist violence ravaging afghanistan and iraq all began on that warm november morning

4954478 hes always been friendly but as youd expect he has what i call a healthy scepticism about me i think any father would if their daughter got married the way we did
4954479 weve spoken on the phone four or five times and that was tough we agreed we need to meet face to face i am planning to get to england as soon as i can and with peaches tell him my feelings im really nervous but peaches reckons its all cool

4954521 engaged in bizarre antics that your average zegna clad washington lobbyist would never have dreamed of
4954522 i should have done this earlier when an honest answer could have affected me personally i did not do so for one reason alone i feared that if i answered honestly i could not win the south carolina primary so i chose to compromise my principles i broke my promise to always tell the truth

4954524 the gaza correspondent alan johnston was once given hairs in pakistan which were thought to have been taken from a yeti and they turned out to be hairs from a goats scrotum
4954525 its as much a mental game as a physical one
4954526 its the cn tower and the toronto skyline that never seem to get any bigger and your mind begins to play tricks on you
4954527 for the next few minutes everybody is invited to be a member of the band
4954528 you gotta warm yourself up for def leppard so help us out
4954529 it would really motivate kids theyd be really working toward something
4954530 unless youre in basketball or sports scholarships dont come easy a lot of kids nowadays especially black kids arent thinking about college unless they have a scholarship or their parents can send them they dont go
4954531 i have never been in favor of money for grades even for my own kids
4954532 i would have to look at the proposal and the evidence to see if this is something i would support
4954533 in one way or another we are always rewarding our kids for activities in school
4954534 for kids in poverty areas they really do not have those same opportunities and what we see is these kids are in survival mode anything you can do financially is tremendously helpful and a natural motivator
4954535 but our whole history is to work hard and go to school to learn not to make money youre countering those forces by doing something like this
4954536 the reality is theres more incentive for them to go to their job than to go to school
4954537 i know a lot of people have that problem because their job needs them at certain hours of the day
4954538 if somebody tells us wed get paid to go to school and get a class done that would make somebody want to hurry up and get their class done
4954539 one of many kinds of solutions we should look at
4954540 as we get more and more poor kids more kids are going to drop out because they need money other kids will drop out because of higher graduation requirements
4954541 there are multiple issues we need to address in multiple ways
4954542 is exploratory and based on a small number of cases it shows consistent impact of incentive and reward programs
4954543 we are very opposed to any incentives of that nature because it dumbs down learning
4954544 will it work for some absolutely but i dont think its a cure all that will solve whatever issue ails them
4954545 but its another opportunity some kids will take advantage of and it offers them the opportunity to go on to college and have funding for them to do that that otherwise they wouldnt have
4954546 anything is worth looking at especially if its been successful elsewhere
4954547 i think its absolutely worth considering but wed need to see some solid data to know whether it would be worth trying
4954548 i dont think theres anything wrong with testing some notions or piloting programs to see if the data shows they can work
4954549 the idea is that even a small amount can motivate people
4954550 kids at scavo dont really think they have a chance they feel like theyre going to scavo and thats it for the rest of their life
4954551 i need to go to college these days you cant do much at all without a college degree
4954552 there are no hipaa cops out there looking for violations
4954553 enforcement at the office for civil rights is virtually nonexistent
4954554 technically theyve still not issued a single fine not even down to the 100 level and they could toss those around like candy if only to wake people up about the seriousness of compliance
4954555 ocr has investigated complaints against many different types of entities including national pharmacy chains major medical centers group health plans hospital chains and small provider offices
4954556 she told this information to a lot of people in town and the news got around
4954557 enforcement is left to the health care community to sort of self police itself and to the office of civil rights which has done virtually nothing
4954558 we have found that this is the most effective way to obtain industry compliance with the privacy rule
4954559 that took away your ability as a patient to control access to your information
4954560 so now there is no real privacy right to be violated
4954561 the privacy provisions of hipaa are serious and have significant consequences if they are violated
4954562 long gone are the days when medical employees were able to snoop around office files for juicy information to share outside the office
4954563 the ceo made the decision to give her a very stiff warning that said never again would this be tolerated
4954564 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
4954565 just because im an employee doesnt mean that you as my supervisor can look at that information
4954566 i dont think thats prosecutable because of the way hipaa was gutted after it was approved
4954567 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4954568 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4954569 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4954570 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4954571 weve written to him on three occasions saying look weve got a plan we want to discuss with you and were just getting no response
4954572 i think theyre so emersed in their internal considerations they dont seem to care about our public schools and our tafe colleges
4954573 im not anxious to hear a rehash of previous conversations that theyve had
4954574 crikey how the fuck does all of this fit together
4954575 this blows no wonder everyone kept telling me not to do such and such
4954576 if at first doing something inadvisable doesnt work out then maybe doing it again a couple hundred times might just do the trick
4954577 heres a thought experiment for you imagine the mid 1990s just before super mario 64 was due to be released for nintendos new console the nintendo 64

4954587 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
4954588 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
4954589 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
4954590 the n word nobody talks about that anymore but people dont have the same recognition that calling someone a retard is really very hurtful
4954591 a cheap thrill that gets its humor by demeaning people with disabilities
4954592 by nature of being an r rated comedy its inappropriate at all levels intentionally
4954593 comedy needs the right to be offensive and stiller at least has the courage of his convictions when he uses the word retard its deliberate not casual
4954594 there were several real good cattle but i liked his muscle and his balance
4954595 t his press office will continue to strive to be accommodating to channel 2 but it will be a great improvement if some respect can be shown for the civil servants who work here even if its too much to ask that information we provide to you gets some reasonable treatment in the newscasts

4954597 young love the conservative political action committee club for growth generally is full force behind republicans in its bid to get small government backers into congress but not everyone gets in the club the group recently started running ads in alaska blasting rep don young r bridge to nowhere the tv ad is a clip of young at a hearing talking about the gas tax id suggest we raise the taxes to a dollar a gallon that makes you put your money where your mouth is its a bit unfair really if you start going after every far out proposal don young throws out there youd never do anything else
4954598 tuesday july 15 9 50 p m a cyclist was attacked by an eagle as he pedaled past the dutch harbor post office the cyclist sustained several deep lacerations to his head and subsequently visited the clinic for medical care the eagle remains at large
4954599 a request for a more specific statement of the details of the offense charged
4954600 is to provide additional information that the indictment and minutes of testimony do not give
4954601 facts surrounding the giving of access to the victim and dna evidence
4954602 if a student gets behind there have to be some places along the way to correct their trajectory for graduation and its getting harder and harder for students to do that

4954604 any time you raise the bar you tend to see what in education circles is referred to as an implementation dip
4954605 the sound comes from a double hinged tap on the shoe for extra sound
4954606 we joke with people that the noise we make is not the sound of our brains rattling

4954610 you know when i was up there what i was thinking about i was thinking about my sister
4954611 take the marble out of your hands lock it up
4954612 take your thumb and place it underneath your second finger rest the marble under the thumb and cradle it with your index finger
4954613 the intent is to have the purchase made without increasing taxes and have it funded through land sales and grants
4954614 i looked at that painting thousands of times and you always find something different
4954615 works of art in college and university museums were never meant to be commodities
4954616 gartners position with the universitys board of regents and his wifes at dmac raises serious questions about whether gartner is trying to leverage a forced de accessioning of the uima pollock to a museum in which his wife is active
4954617 my wife like probably 2 9 million other iowans didnt even know the university owned a 150 million painting if thats what its worth until it was in the news in recent weeks
4954618 sell the painting and dont build any more art buildings over ponds or along rivers duh
4954619 some of them dont go out looking for salt until later in the year we are just concerned that some of them may be surprised when they contact their salt vendor and find that no salt is available
4954620 i am able to secure some salt but if we have a winter like we did last year we are going to have a definite problem
4954621 we are out for bid again right now and hopefully this time we will get a bite
4954622 upsetting the flood broke my building i didnt like looking at it
4954623 we thought maybe he could raise 1 000 from some family or friends
4954624 you never know how something like this will go but tyler wanted to help this was his way we said go for it
4954625 then i did another one then i did another one three times i never did that before
4954626 he did it because the arc is his life outside the family
4954627 we couldnt imagine not having it there his three siblings have their lives working and going to school with arc tylers social life is as busy as theirs probably busier
4954628 tyler loved helping at the library and was so sad he hasnt been able to go back
4954629 so we called the hiawatha library and they said theyd be delighted to have his help
4954630 we want to be back up and running by january 1
4954631 thats ambitious but when people like tyler are willing to do what he did it doesnt seem impossible his bicycle ride was amazing
4954632 i got started riding at 11 10 and i got done right around 12 30 i had a lot of people cheering me on right now my goal is to raise 15 000 and so far i raised about 12 000 if we keep the thermometer rising like that we can start rebuilding the old arc building and we dont have much further to go

4954637 katzer and kamind admitted that they copied the decoder definition files from the decoderpro software they also admitted that they stripped out the jmri credit information and comment fields the information removed from each copied file includes references to the copyright owner author copyright date and information about the artistic license therefore katzer and kamind violated the artistic license by not including standard versions of the executable files not explaining where to get the standard version and not indicating how the decoder definition files were changed
4954638 katzer concedes for the purposes of this appeal that jacobsen is the owner or assignee of the copyright and that katzer downloaded modified and distributed the decoder definition files however jacobsen has failed to show that katzer has infringed one of jacobsens exclusive copyright rights as a threshold matter jacobsens attempt to use federal copyright law to enforce that terms of the artistic license that require that the jmri group receive credit or attribution in derivative works is misplaced copyright law as it is presently written does not recognize a cause of action for non economic rights
4954639 the jmri project license provides that a user may copy the files verbatim or may otherwise modify the material in any way including as part of a larger possibly commercial software distribution
4954640 the license explicitly gives the users of the material any member of the public the right to use and distribute the material in a more or less customary fashion plus the right to make reasonable accommodations the scope of the nonexclusive license is therefore intentionally broad the condition that the user insert a prominent notice of attribution does not limit the scope of the license rather defendants alleged violation of the conditions of the license may have constituted a breach of the nonexclusive license but does not create liability for copyright infringement where it would not otherwise exist
4954641 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however there are substantial benefits including economic benefits to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties for example program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge similarly a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects improvement to a product can come rapidly and free of charge from an expert not even known to the copyright holder the eleventh circuit has recognized the economic motives inherent in public licenses even where profit is not immediate
4954642 in non technical terms the court has held that free licenses such as the creative commons licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4954643 when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the general public license and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
4954644 i studied one of the mummies the larger one back in 1979 and determined the blood group data from this baby mummy and compared it with my 1969 blood grouping of tutankhamun
4954645 the results confirmed that this larger fetus could indeed be the daughter of tutankhamen
4954646 this is a very important project as these fetuses have never been fully studied
4954647 the fetuses might help identify the lineage and the family of king tutankhamun particularly his parents
4954648 since these two fetuses were found in the tomb of tutankhamen there is no reason to think that they were other than his offspring a matter supported by my 1979 blood group studies
4954649 wolves consume many prey animals a minimum of 150 200 moose contribute to an isle royale wolfs diet over the course of its lifetime and the prey consume a whole lot of plants
4954650 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
4954651 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
4954652 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
4954653 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
4954654 a customer is the most important visitor on our premises he is not dependent on us we are dependent on him he is not an interruption in our work he is the purpose of it he is not an outsider in our business he is part of it we are not doing him a favour by serving him he is doing us a favour by giving us an opportunity to do so
4954655 i will give you a talisman whenever you are in doubt or when the self becomes too much with you apply the following test recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him will he gain anything by it will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny in other words will it lead to it worked every time its not that i looked for happiness in the misery of others never the principle was so evident i me myself
4954656 i want freedom for the full expression of my personality
4954657 the difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the worlds problems
4954658 wenn es irgendwo in der welt eine ethnisch religi se gruppe gibt deren situation man mit der der juden im dritten reich vergleichen kann dann sind es die bahai im iran deren lage noch dadurch erschwert wird dass sich ihr spirituelles zentrum in haifa befindet
4954659 you just cut the cable right they are so easy you dont need special equipment most of the designs added weight to the bike which is the last thing youd want to do
4954660 i have people calling me up all the time to ask about bikes its a headache
4954661 if it cost 99 and had a 5 monthly fee id see it as something people would want to buy but for now technology prohibits wide consumer appeal but we continue to imagine maybe in a year or two
4954662 its an industry thats out of touch with city cyclists
4954663 the city has said it wants to promote cycling but theyve got to tackle the problem of theft
4954664 the city is adding bike lanes and promoting safety programs at the end of the day you come out and your bikes not there what does it matter how much the city is putting into infrastructure
4954665 the first thing people ask about a lock is is it heavy
4954666 to thwart a thief using strong tools you need a strong lock thats not defeatable
4954667 the person called it in right from the ship itself so the other party noticed his companion was missing
4954668 we went looking in the area where the boat was the division where the boat was last known
4954669 if the court was divided and we were sitting seven there might be a little bit of uncertainty
4954670 had the new person been on the court for example would it have made a difference
4954671 some idea was put out by i dont know who some rumour or some source that somehow the chair leads the discussion
4954672 im there to make sure the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly and not to weigh in for or against any particular candidate
4954673 sometimes there is consensus but certainly that is not a requirement
4954674 im required to do it its not something i chose to do
4954675 i feel so lucky that we can stand here now and look at this
4954676 im so nervous i feel like a shockwaves coming to me and im just bracing myself
4954677 we all have something at the bottom of our stomachs in knots really
4954678 adults we can pick up and move on but i dont know how theyre going to move on
4954679 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4954680 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4954681 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4954682 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4954683 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4954684 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4954685 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4954686 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4954687 its as much a mental game as a physical one
4954688 its the cn tower and the toronto skyline that never seem to get any bigger and your mind begins to play tricks on you
4954689 none of us really approve of bulwer lytton being used as an example of bad writing hes a great hero to us all over here
4954690 is a whimsical literary competition that challenges entrants to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels
4954691 in keeping with the gravitas high seriousness and general bignitude of the contest the grand prize winner will receive a pittance
4954692 the evil that men do lives after them in lyttons case in 27 novels whose perfervid turgidity i intend to expose denude and generally make visible
4954693 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a clich is genius i agree now that the words are clich d but if youre the first to pen them then surely thats a remarkable thing something to be proud of
4954694 im ready to concede the guy did have some powers of invention
4954695 some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4954696 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius
4954697 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
4954698 lord lytton was also deeply concerned about the welfare of b c s first nations and sent specific instructions to gov james douglas in that regard
4954699 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4954700 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4954701 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4954702 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4954703 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4954704 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4954705 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4954706 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4954707 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4954708 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4954709 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4954710 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4954711 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4954712 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4954713 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4954714 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4954715 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4954716 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4954717 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4954718 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4954719 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4954720 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4954721 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4954722 fortune 500 hardly anyones even heard of ulrich in fact those who think his name rings a bell are most likely picturing robert urich the deceased actor from televisions vega and spencer for hire
4954723 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4954724 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4954725 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4954726 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4954727 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4954728 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4954729 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4954730 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4954731 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4954732 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4954733 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4954734 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4954735 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4954736 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4954737 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4954738 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4954739 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4954740 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4954741 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4954742 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4954743 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4954744 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4954745 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4954746 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4954747 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4954748 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4954749 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4954750 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4954751 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4954752 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4954753 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4954754 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4954755 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4954756 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4954757 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4954758 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4954759 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4954760 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4954761 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4954762 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4954763 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4954764 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4954765 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4954766 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4954767 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4954768 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4954769 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4954770 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4954771 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4954772 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4954773 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4954774 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4954775 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4954776 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4954777 who are open to doing something on the production side
4954778 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4954779 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4954780 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4954800 i think it was a difficult game first half they controlled the game in the opening 45 minutes but didnt have clear chances other than one we were a little under pressure but the second half was different
4954801 we were controlling it and the quality of our passing was much better we had plenty of possession and were much better going forward
4954802 the difference at the end of the game was torres

4955109 while homeowners and businesses continue to embrace solar energy at a tremendous rate this growth is somehow restricted by the relatively limited number of consumers who are exposed to solar in their daily lives
4955110 by providing these informational kiosks in these regional locations sams club is demonstrating exceptional leadership in bringing solar energy to the masses we applaud sams club for its introduction of its home efficiency centers and we are honored to be a part of the companys forward thinking position on renewable energy

4955112 weve got the best line up of products to make a home more efficient and those looking to save a little green or the planet will appreciate our prices they will see savings at the register and going forward on their utility bills we are optimistic we will be able to bring this concept to more of our clubs
4955113 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that

4955120 the bigger and more important the project the more likely it is to have a number of levels

4955165 in short children have a right not to have their minds addled by nonsense and we as a society have a duty to protect them from it so we should no more allow parents to teach their children to believe for example in the literal truth of the bible or that the planets rule their lives than we should allow parents to knock their childrens teeth out or lock them in a dungeon

4955171 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4955172 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4955173 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4955174 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
4955175 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
4955176 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
4955177 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
4955178 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
4955179 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
4955180 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
4955181 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4955182 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4955183 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
4955184 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
4955185 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
4955186 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
4955187 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
4955188 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
4955189 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things

4955192 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
4955193 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

4955262 the offense has been getting a lot of the headlines lately so it was nice to see the defensive side rise up and establish themselves everyone from the first team on down played with enthusiasm pursued to the ball and made plays we had four quarterback sacks and forced three fumbles so i was really pleased with that side of the ball
4955263 i think there were some positive things on both sides
4955264 we held our own but our goals are way higher than just holding our own
4955265 what we got done was there was opportunity for some of the competitions to be sorted out
4955266 and i think there were plenty of repetitions to make sure that happened what the final assessment will be we wont know until we watch film
4955267 i wanted to get it in every time we have got to be more consistent we have to have a nice drive every time we step on the field

4955294 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4955295 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4955296 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4955297 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4955298 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4955299 your father is going to need a liver transplant its our only option at this point
4955300 im sending you to the best liver team in the world they will be the ones to help you through this
4955301 about two or three times a year i will see someone with a case of subfulminant hepatitis
4955302 its when a normal liver is there and something else comes in and you can see its clearly not going to do well that is what lalit had but we didnt know the time frame so you get to a point where enough is enough when things come in and damage the liver and its not getting better after a few months then enough is enough
4955303 it is something thats becoming more heard of and more families are coming in here educated about it
4955304 ten years ago it wasnt being done very often in the us and now its coming more into the limelight and people are learning that the kidneys arent the only organ that can be transplanted with a living donor
4955305 we performed our first live liver donor transplant here on dec 10 1997
4955306 we actually did back to back ones because we did laheys second one on the 11th
4955307 its about 95 percent accurate so when i go in i know exactly where to cut and what things are going to look like
4955308 this is where i learned to love the peasant the indigenous people and to admire their efforts to excel despite adverse conditions
4955309 the hope is that my children will find work and learn a trade to meet their expenses
4955310 lugo has good intentions but i dont know if hell be able to fulfill his promises in five years

4955331 no toda enfermedad psicol gica apodada por el correspondiente profesional como derivada de una problem tica laboral puede conceptuarse como accidente de trabajo por graves que puedan llegar a ser sus consecuencias la problem tica laboral severa o no no constituye per se acoso moral y por ende no puede calificarse el menoscabo ps quico incapacitarte como accidente de trabajo
4955332 el hecho de tener por ejemplo como superior jer rquico a una persona dura y exigente no constituye acoso
4955333 es posible que el trastorno padecido por la demandante tenga relaci n con la problem tica o incluso el descontento que vive en su actividad laboral pero esto no lleva a la enfermedad al mbito de la enfermedad profesional al accidente de trabajo o al acoso moral ya que la enfermedad no est producida exclusivamente por el trabajo
4955334 al empresario le corresponde el poder de direcci n consagrado en el art 20 del et y si esto es as no es posible cada vez que se ejercita el mismo alegar por parte del trabajador acoso moral puesto que quedar a sin contenido la facultad de direcci n y control que la normativa laboral atribuye al empresario en definitiva sin negar la existencia de trastorno ansioso depresivo reactivo a conflictividad laboral sufrido por el trabajado no se acredita que tenga un car cter verdaderamente objetivo originado por una conducta hostil pudiendo derivarse de una reacci n subjetiva ante los cambios y la nueva pol tica de actuaci n establecida por la nueva gerente

4955410 he lawson came to the meeting with a list of players he thought should play for pakistan in the champions trophy
4955411 when he was told by the selectors that they would review his list and would also consult with the pcb before naming the national team lawson lost his cool he told the selectors what now you will discuss my team in an angry tone and was immediately told to behave
4955412 lawson was told by the selectors that he can only give his input which would be considered by the selectors they also made it clear that the selection committee had the final say over the team combination the coach wasn t very happy with that argument
4955413 since the court maintained the fine the pcb cannot allow him to play for pakistan as it would be tantamount to flouting the ruling of the court
4955414 his lawyer has argued that akhtar can pay the fine once the appeal against the reduced ban is heard in the court so we have decided to keep the legal matter and cricket separate

4955425 sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 brandy mcdonnell interviews the filmmakers exclusive
4955426 we really had the girl power on this movie not intentionally per se i think its wonderful and i think it helps and i think its a great thing
4955427 but obviously when the audience members are going to buy their tickets they dont buy them based on that and they dont know about that
4955428 we dont think about those things for example our composer rachel portman i just love her music if she was a guy i would love his music i mean its really about the art
4955429 like my editor melissa kent i love her work but its not based to me on a gender
4955430 i made sure that i didnt know who the composer was when melissa would play me the music and i started gravitating toward rachel portmans music every time
4955431 she has this classic feel thats vibrant and dynamic and shes very collaborative so i just felt that she would be such the perfect fit for this movie
4955432 the sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 centers on four disparate lifelong friends the first film followed them as teenagers spending their first summer apart they kept in touch by mailing around a pair of jeans that magically fit all four perfectly despite their different body types
4955433 it had a life after the theatrical release it was a beautiful film which we all were extremely proud of having made
4955434 but if you go by the actual business side of things i think nine times out of 10 there wouldnt have been a sequel from that movie but my fellow producers and i guess the following of the movie really felt these characters really had to live on on the screen
4955435 there is this relationship between these girls and its unconditional and i think its the kind of relationship that we all long for it enables them to kind of go off in the world and challenge themselves and find out new things and then kind of come back to their little hub and share it again
4955436 its not a competitive friendship theres no backbiting and that was part of my inspiration for this its not that they dont have problems they dont have conflicts because they do but theres such a kind of a reservoir of love and trust between them and i think that thats something that people in the books and the movies have really responded to
4955437 at this day and time in our society when girls are under so much pressure to look a certain way i think competition is really rampant and i think in the very first movie one of the things that we tried to portray with the jeans fitting all the girls is that really its not the outside of you that matters its the inside of you that matters and we felt like that resonated with audiences who were seeing it
4955438 hopefully in this next film you see the girls have gone their individual taken their own paths and theyre not the same as each other and i think its nice because that still bonds them in some ways their differences still bond them
4955439 it was very collaborative we would sit like 10 of us around a table and really go through each storyline and each characters development
4955440 when the first movie came out a lot of people had the perception that it was a chick flick or a teen movie or different sorts of genres and we all knew what we had it was a very special and well done beautiful movie and i think that word got out and i really believe that older women came and were surprised and we had wonderful word of mouth on it
4955441 so we did indeed try to invite women of all ages as we will do with this one to come and enjoy it and participate this has certainly been the summer of womens films and i think we have seen that women can drive the box office as much as sort of the male dominant films so were very proud of it and hoping to have the same success or more with this one

4955446 ive appeared on many stages in my career but im humbled and honored to appear on this stage today
4955447 a lot of people will turn out at sporting events and activities to see the band also
4955448 its also an important part of the services that we offer our communities in addition to the music education program for our students one of the things that im so pleased with that has changed over the course of the years is we have so many band students now who receive college scholarships weve had many students to receive scholarships from colleges and universities because of their participation in band and choral music
4955449 the students start rehearsing shortly after the first of july
4955450 they only have about a three week summer vacation period before they are back at it practicing and getting ready for football games in most cases with the west virginia side schools they have a major performance before the first day of classes
4955451 i am a great supporter of music in the schools
4955452 i myself serve as the pianist for my local church our band at big creek high school is led by milken award winner leroy courts iaeger high school will have a new band director this year after spending the second semester of last year without a certified instructor franklin dishman has moved from mount view the middle level grades to iaeger high school mount view high schools band is led by michelle morgan i would love to see more students take an interest in participating in their schools music programs
4955453 musical education is a vital part of the instructional program for our students in tazewell county lawson said
4955454 we have music education that begins in elementary school all of our children participate in our music program from pre k all the way on in the middle school level we kind of branch off a little bit and our students will then choose to either go core music or band its a wonderful program not only through participation at various school activities but also with what we do in the community with music education anytime anyone is having any festival or activity our band and our choral groups are certainly most often a part of their activities
4955455 we couldnt have the caliber of bands we have certainly without the commitment that our band directors and students make
4955456 the many things we do could not be done without the support of our band parents i want to say i have the utmost respect for the parents that work day in and day out to support our band program they feed and prepare snacks and meals and they move equipment with us very friday night or anytime our bands go on to competition we have been blessed with very very wonderful parents in our community

4955466 its gone from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredths to winning the 400 free by nine one hundredths to getting my best time in every event
4955467 it has been nothing but an upward roller coaster its been nothing but fun
4955468 anything could happen i just wanted to go out hard and hold on as strong as i could
4955469 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put together a solid team effort and we were able to come together as one unit
4955470 for the three olympics ive been a part of this has been by far the closest mens team weve ever had
4955471 its gone from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredths to winning the 400 free by nine one hundredths to getting my best time in every event
4955472 during the opening ceremonies i was the only utahn out there it was just me it gets a little lonely
4955473 i go to see all the people i havent seen in a year
4955474 i think there were some positive things on both sides
4955475 we held our own but our goals are way higher than just holding our own
4955476 what we got done was there was opportunity for some of the competitions to be sorted out
4955477 and i think there were plenty of repetitions to make sure that happened what the final assessment will be we wont know until we watch film

4955486 it was a little awkward but for the most part i felt comfortable i had numerous people on the redskins say it didnt look right but its going to start looking right
4955487 i knew i was out there for the right reason im not going to say i havent second guessed my decision but when i stepped on the field i knew i made the right decision ive said it before im here for one reason and thats to help these guys win

4955496 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
4955497 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
4955498 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
4955499 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
4955500 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
4955501 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
4955502 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
4955503 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
4955504 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
4955505 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning

4955552 my mentor who i have known for nine years and never opened up to he basically came to my house
4955553 i was in my room talking to people and thinking they were very concerned i was on the edge things werent going well i felt i must open up before its too late
4955554 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very in my mind unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just really felt there was no outlet my mom was there but i wanted the rest of her life to be worry free and i tried to keep everything from her i just felt alone
4955555 really showed me he cared and that meant a lot to me
4955556 i have the support of my teammates it feels good to get back on the field and be around the guys im very confident of their support if there is anyone who doubts me no one shows it theres been nothing but support here i feel back at home
4955557 you could tell that hes been working and looks strong
4955558 thats the important thing right now keep open communication like i said hes got a good support staff right now and i think hes in a good place well see how it works out
4955559 right now he is very upbeat and positive he feels better looks better in just the couple of days that hes been here weve seen a little bit of sense of relief when youre talking to him
4955560 when he moved up here and got on that same route and when we felt that he was in a good place we talked about the football part of it
4955561 thats kind of whats taken the time you get into these things the football part is secondary to the person we want to make sure that persons all right
4955562 there were a lot of rumors and like i said i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors
4955563 at the time coach reid didnt know people were saying contract or he didnt want to play football anymore i admit i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration
4955564 i didnt care what people thought they really didnt know they have a guy who is quick tempered it was to the point where i didnt really care anymore that wasnt the real me i didnt realize what i was going through
4955565 now that hes been here hes been received by his teammates and really the people that hes run into outside the building in a very positive manner
4955566 so you can see a little bit of the stress that he was carrying in his face hes got a little relief there thats a positive thing i think
4955567 ive been using my emotions and aggressions in my workouts
4955568 im feeling pretty strong that 331 is lighter than what i would be playing
4955569 ive received a lot of phone calls from public figures and people who have gone through what im going through
4955570 ive also learned that among african american men and really men period we just hold things in whether its a football player or a man you are still like im a man nothing bothers me but if you internalize it it has to come out somewhere
4955571 people question my silliness but im a fun loving guy being around people i dont care what creed you are it just ignites my silliness youll never know if im hurting on the inside i found out
4955572 last week he was uncovered and this week he was covered
4955573 i thought it was strange when i went to church here in nebraska and everybody didnt have an automatic weapon
4955574 i actually had that feeling that i should have been back over there helping soldiers that were still overseas
4955575 when you leave theres a hole with a family where a soldier or airman isnt there any more so the family starts to change a little bit
4955576 i just want to come back with some skills i can help my soldiers deal with issues
4955577 shes just my stepmom and she knows i hate her
4955578 the only way shes leaving this house is in a body bag
4955579 i used to cry all the time but now i cant even cry anymore
4955580 well i guess id just have to kill myself too after i killed her
4955581 he still continued to harbor his thoughts of his stepmother
4955582 it was very clear he could not go home as my belief is that he would have acted on it
4955583 he feels anxious about his placement but knows that is his best option since he has difficulties getting along with his stepmother
4955584 they were very concerned and i was on the edge
4955585 things werent going well so i felt like i must open up before its too late i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very i guess in my mind unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things
4955586 i was really lost and just really felt like there was no outlet i know my mom was there but i want the rest of her life to be worry free so i try and keep everything from her i just felt alone you know
4955587 coach reid after he realized that shawn andrews did have a serious problem he was very positive about the situation hes a funny guy i mean he helps you laugh and tries to make the situation better but ultimately he really showed that he cared and that meant a lot to me
4955588 i guess now that ive spoken about my issues or my clinical depression if you will i think it really lifted a weight off of me because i received so many letters and emails good and bad
4955589 but i just pay attention to the good ones and the people that i inspire that let me know that
4955590 ive received a lot of phone calls from public figures and people who have gone through what im going through
4955591 but if you internalize it it has to come out somewhere people question my silliness but im a fun loving guy being around people i dont care what creed you are it just ignites my silliness youll never know if im hurting on the inside i found out
4955592 first and foremost it was just good to get back with my fellow offensive linemen
4955593 the kind of fun that we have i really missed it and just being in the huddle with donovan he is a very charismatic guy and it kind of helps for that moment to take away the issues in your mind it was just refreshing a beautiful day
4955594 right when he got back we put him through a workout to see where he was at and he did very well on that hes been a guy even when he was heavier hes got good endurance naturally good endurance you could tell that hes been working and looks strong and hes worked out just about every day since hes been back here
4955595 well get a support crew around him he worked out friday with juan castillo and well see how he does today he seems to be in a good place right now
4955596 coach reid allowed me some time after one of the team meetings
4955597 i just felt like it was something that i needed to do because of the way that i just disappeared
4955598 if they dont im going to do everything possible to gain the respect back
4955599 i was pretty pessimistic how my teammates would receive me back its been tough im still going through a lot its been a big step for me
4955600 we talked about making sure shawn was ok and that he got the help that he needed then he moved up here and got on that same route and when we felt that he was in a good place we talked about the football part of it thats kind of whats taken the time you get into these things the football part is secondary to the person and we want to make sure that persons alright
4955601 im very confident and if theres anybody that doubts me nobody shows it
4955602 theres nothing but support here thats the good thing about the organization they do a good job of getting character guys here i feel im back at home
4955603 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
4955604 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
4955605 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
4955606 america is in great difficulty and we are experiencing enormous economic challenges as well as others
4955607 for the last two and a half months i have been fighting three levels of oppression which were stifling my ideas and productivity and it just came to a head where i wasnt able to function and give of my all
4955608 they seem to feel that there is a political emphasis in all of this i have no political affiliations or bias i have always kept away from politics and when i saw it raise its head to a political level i knew something was going wrong
4955609 you have people working in an institution fighting against people who are trying to make it better
4955610 i was a senior person in the hospital and i did not like how i was treated in the public domain something was wrong with that
4955611 it really hurts to see how my work and how i sacrificed so much now being reduced to this level
4955612 for the past 19 years i have been there i came through the ranks i have never done anything else but hospital business and health related matters although others seem to think differently i do feel very hurt and very disappointed to the point of depression
4955613 we zijn dolgelukkig dat phelps het record breekt hij is een fenomenaal talent dit extraatje heeft hij absoluut verdiend
4955614 geen enkele andere trainer zou mij tot dit niveau hebben kunnen brengen
4955615 using anti depressants increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior among young people
4955616 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
4955617 you never know what you had until you lost it
4955618 the air conditioning doesnt work so well so were probably going to sit and be miserable
4955619 the forecast is possible thunder and lightning so thats not good
4955620 i see by your outfit that you are an agent
4955621 i see by your outfit you are an agent too
4955622 we see by our outfits that we are both agents
4955623 if you get an outfit you can be an agent too
4955624 its nice to see a day out there where the kids are having fun and somebody says we really enjoyed the carnival
4955625 its a good catch up time because theyve been busy with their season and weve been busy with ours
4955626 we get a chance to see our nephews we have a lot of laughs together
4955627 theyre really easy to work with they have a great safety record
4955628 its having a real effect there are some fairs doing without carnivals especially in areas with smaller population
4955629 theres not enough revenue to overcome the amount of fuel costs
4955630 we used to go out in the spring and fall and do small dates
4955631 but now with the fuel it is a big deal
4955632 rather than families traveling to places like disneyland theyre coming to local carnivals
4955633 therell always be carnivals as long as there are kids
4955634 whatever it takes theyll find different ways to work things out
4955635 people in the fair industry are very kind and very giving the camaraderie is very very important in this industry
4955636 i met my wife working in the cotton candy stand when she was 13 years old
4955637 my mom hired her we kind of flirted with each other for a couple of years
4955638 patriotic to stop the flow of jobs and make a quality life with less importance for money
4955639 it is a natural result of what is going on in iraq under this u s occupation that so many iraqi students failed the high school exams
4955640 how can a student pass such difficult exams feeling terrified exhausted in the heat in darkness without electricity having to work in the absence of a dead or detained father and all the problems of the world over his head
4955641 i am ashamed of the results my school achieved this year
4955642 i cannot tell you what percentage we achieved because that will reveal me and my school you do not really believe we are living in a democratic country do you
4955643 if a student is the son of a senior government official or of a member of an armed group how can we stop them from cheating we would be killed
4955644 the low number of students who passed the exams shows credibility and discipline
4955645 i live in an old two room house with my family after we were evicted from shab quarter of amiriya in baghdad
4955646 there are five of us plus our parents in the small place that lacks most living necessities such as electricity not to mention the noisy atmosphere of the crowded space i passed arabic and english because i am good at them but failed the other exams that needed me to study hard
4955647 my father was detained by u s forces in 2005
4955648 his fashion shop was looted by the so called iraqi army who came with the americans to take him away and so now i have to work as a labourer to support my family
4955649 i decided to stop fooling myself by dreaming of going to college and becoming a lawyer
4955650 one has to face reality that iraq is finished as a country
4955651 the americans and their collaborators need us as dirty policemen and garbage collectors who locate roadside bombs for them
4955652 we must realise that college has become a luxury that we cannot afford
4955653 i was the first in my family to be born in canada
4955654 and its very special to them obviously and to me that they be here and be able to see such an accomplishment for me to reach my dream
4955655 theyre already proud of me for getting here its just really great that they could get here and see it happen right in front of their eyes
4955656 my mom and dad have one of those stories that should be written in a book
4955657 they did everything my dad was a carpenter for a while he kind of worked odd jobs like in a sawmill my mom she waitressed
4955658 im pretty sure i learned my work ethic from them
4955659 they worked so hard for us to have a better life i mean theres five of us kids they had to raise and support
4955660 im not sure how much its really registering right now i couldnt be any more proud
4955661 its an amazing story of leaving another country and looking to start a family where theres possibilities
4955662 i was just thinking how proud i am to be canadian just thinking about i guess the road to how i got here its been a long one but a good one
4955663 i was waving to my family especially and my friends and teammates and coaches
4955664 and i was waving at any canadian flag i could see
4955665 i feel like pinball former coach michael clemons must have felt a lot of nights sitting in this chair
4955666 we need to change this the offences inconsistencies its been a focal point for us since last december and its not working so we need to go to plan c or d or e or f
4955667 i dont know its not that day yet ive got to sleep on it a couple of nights and watch a lot more film
4955668 you cant bring in a lot of people at this point
4955669 besides i dont reach on the other side of the fence look elsewhere for help i try to reach within
4955670 weve got good athletes and we have some good plans we have not put it together though
4955671 id love to get the opportunity being the guy going in to start but its not my call
4955672 hopefully they get things together on the break and figure out what direction they want to go in
4955673 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4955674 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
4955675 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around okay
4955676 were calling it a contusion right now im not concerned
4955677 i dont know but we might have a few guys who can pick that slack up
4955678 im going to wait i havent made up my mind i havent talked to my family i havent talked to anyone about it i dont want to be distracted with anything right now
4955679 were well aware that thats a situation that can happen
4955680 the key to successful leadership today is influence not authority
4955681 bukan yang terkuat yang mampu berumur panjang melainkan yang paling adaptif
4955682 it will be a cold day in hell before i sleep with you and take into account the fact that i slept with her last night then number 2 must be true and this i am sure that hell is exothermic and has already frozen over

4955685 i was inspired by nasa pictures of black holes and distant galaxies and it made me think of our own fragile ozone layer and the ozone molecule o3
4955686 we use different techniques everything is hand made first to get the vibrant colors we premiered azo free dyes in nepal these are the legal standard dyes in europe but most asian countries dont have that regulation and work with dyes that are extremely harmful to the workers health for the paler colors we are experimenting with herbal ayurvedic dyes to preserve the purity of the organic materials

4955688 im about as excited about that as i am about fortran 95
4955689 im here to support the gb team but also in view of london 2012 as rowing is a very important sport for us i am especially watching the venue management the atmosphere is really good the grandstands are packed as it was already yesterday for athletics where we had 81000 spectators on the first day
4955690 kirsten reminded me at the start gold shoes golden race
4955691 i thought we had the bronze i saw the big surge 4 100ths of a second we stayed efficient and effective through the middle 1000m and had a fairly effective start we knew in the last 500m we had to dig a lot deeper weve enjoyed rowing with each other its been fun
4955692 im ecstatic its an amazing result weve put something on the board for canada lets keep the momentum going
4955693 we were really happy to be in the final were a very stable crew and have been finalists for the past three years of course we hoped for something better but its hard to win the fight for medals well definitely be at the european championships in athens
4955694 we put in the hard work when it was needed so that we could enjoy the last 250m all according to the race plan there was no panic the whole british team is doing so well with the rowing yesterday and the swimming and the cycling and i hope it continues in the second week it bodes well for four years time
4955695 that was a very satisfactory race this is my first olympic games and its great to have a medal we had a good final sprint if there had been 50m more left we might have won but now we cant say anything gbr won and we were second
4955696 so many people said it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4955697 its gone from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredths to winning the 400 free by nine one hundredths to getting my best time in every event
4955698 it has been nothing but an upward roller coaster its been nothing but fun
4955699 anything could happen i just wanted to go out hard and hold on as strong as i could
4955700 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put together a solid team effort and we were able to come together as one unit
4955701 for the three olympics ive been a part of this has been by far the closest mens team weve ever had
4955702 its gone from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredths to winning the 400 free by nine one hundredths to getting my best time in every event
4955703 kevin 26 januari 2007 21 31 wtf anja dus als een jong
4955704 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundrerdth of a second to finishing if off with a world record its an amazing experience
4955705 i just need a break from running around all the time with spring sing coming up and midterm grades there is a lot of stress
4955706 with spring break getting closer i am trying to save money and it sounded interesting it was by the way
4955707 i really wanted to be able to explore the play with others and find deeper or different meanings than i myself had come up with
4955708 who knows how fast he can go obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69
4955709 he was having fun in the last 20 metres celebrating and breaking the world record in the process thats awesome you can read into it he can probably go under 9 60 but im not good at predictions i just love to see things unfold

4955711 with the 200 our objective is to win were going to try to save as much energy as possible in the rounds we have two rounds on one day before it peters out so once he gets through the first day well be okay
4955712 im just happy i did the country proud that was the aim for me and ill be working harder to even make the country prouder in the 200 metres
4955713 i just have one aim and that is to be a triple gold medallist at this olympics
4955714 my legs felt dead i just was not ready for four rounds after my injuries this season
4955715 now that usain has really done extraordinarily well were going to have to do something extra special for him
4955716 martin tomczyk ist genau die pers nlichkeit die wir uns als schirmherr gew nscht haben gerade bei jungen motorsportfans ist er sehr beliebt weil er trotz seiner erfolge immer noch der ehrliche bodenst ndige typ geblieben ist dass martin seit seiner kindheit ein faible f r den modellbau hat macht die geschichte zus tzlich rund und damit ehrlich
4955717 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
4955718 no doubt left a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region
4955719 not only were these events alien to our region but they also brought into question sadc as an institution capable of promoting the rule of law and democratic governance
4955720 it is becoming apparent to me that the act of building displays like this is playful in its own way through sketching in code you can have something like a conversation with the data and get a sense of what s there perhaps the end result is merely a byproduct of this process
4955721 one of the great things to come out of these olympic games is that the tremendous use of our digital properties online and the great viewership online and the tremendous number of page views is really teaching us a tremendous amount about what people want to consume great content and so were going to come out of these olympics with great digital knowledge and hopefully well be able to turn those digital pennies into digital if not dollars digital 50 cent pieces at some point
4955722 yes but a little more heartless heartless in a good way
4955723 yes i do just remember that ill always know you for who you are
4955724 hearest thou sea robber what this people say for tribute theyre ready to give you their spears the edge poison bitter and the ancient sword war gear that will bring you no profit in the fight thou messenger of the seamen back with thy message tell to thy people these far more hateful tidings there stands here a good earl in the midst of his men who will this country ever defend the kingdom of aethelred mine overlord the folk and the ground but they shall fall the foemen in the fight too shameful methinks that ye with our tribute to ship should be gone without a blow struck now that ye have thus far made your incoming into our land nor shall ye so softly carry off our riches sooner shall point and edge reconcile us grim warplay indeed before we give tribute
4955725 now room is meted you come swiftly to us warriors to war only god knows who at the end shall possess this fights field
4955726 i thank thee lord of all peoples for all those joys that i on earth have known now my maker mild i have most need that thou to my ghost should grant good that my soul to thee may journey into thy kingdom o lord of the angels may pass with peace i do desire of thee that the hell fiends may not hurt it
4955727 think ye of the times when we oft spake at mead when we on the benches did raise up our boast henchmen in the hall about hard strife now may each one make trial of how bold he be now will i tell my lineage to all that i was in mercia of a mighty kindred mine old father aldhelm was hight an alderman wise and rich in wealth nor shall the thanes mid the people reproach me that i would consent to flee from this fight my home to seek now my lord lieth low slain in the strife but yet it most grieves me for that he was both my kinsman and my lord
4955728 lo thou aelfwin hast all heartened thanes at need now our lord lieth the earl on the earth for us all is need that each one of us should hearten the other warrior to war while he his weapon may have and hold his hard blade his spear and good sword for godric hath us oddas coward son all betrayed for many men thought when he rode off on the mare on that proud steed that he was our lord and for that cause are the folk scattered over the field the shield wall broken may his plan come to nought for that he so many men hath set to flight
4955729 i do promise this that i will not hence fly a foots step but shall further go to avenge in the war my friendly lord then shall not need in sturmere the steadfast soldiers to twit me with words now my friend is falln for that i returned home without my lord turned from the battle but the sword shall take me the point and the steel
4955730 brithnoth avenge now may not go he who thinketh to avenge his friend among the folk nor mourn for his life
4955731 thought must be the harder heart the keener spirit shall be more as our might lessens there lies our chief all cut down good man on the ground for ever may he grieve who now from this war play thinketh to go i am old in years hence i will not but by the side of mine own lord by my chief so loved i think to lie
4955732 ahora mismo estamos considerando la retirada pero la decisi n se tomar cuando se estabilice la situaci n en la regi n
4955733 las filas se est n desplazando desde tsjinvali capital de osetia del sur a rusia
4955734 ustedes deben entender que hay una gran cantidad de soldados
4955735 im just really relieved to get back safe and sound after the ordeal up there
4955736 and im just glad its all over and im looking forward to sleeping in a bed tonight
4955737 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4955738 every time degeneres and de rossi visit de rossis family in australia their rights protections and status as a married couple will cease to exist
4955739 it is shameful that portia de rossis solemn marriage vows are dishonoured in this way by the government of her home country
4955740 fact is that there are obstacles in blogging and main issues i see in blogging technical nature and lack of content ideas leading people to quit nevertheless another fact is that can be surpassed with decent guidance to follow there are few ways it can be done from reading good blogging book or following other bloggers tips
4955741 i see wordpress as a mercedes benz in blog publishing
4955742 it was a great performance at the world half marathon championships in canada everybody said i couldnt run but i showed today what i can do
4955743 i got the silver and im not disappointed disappointed isnt in my vocabulary
4955744 i think everybody in china was hoping id win a gold medal
4955745 but i have done what i can i feel a little sorry but i gave it all my potential
4955746 there are some things i still want to do to raise the bar a bit more in the world of swimming
4955747 i would say i would like to go down and start sprinting but bob isnt so keen on that
4955748 well see how keen he is on going to the sprints
4955749 there is more and different training hes more naturally suited to longer events
4955750 i think over the next four years i would like to try new events and see what happens
4955751 bob has said he wants to start fresh and do things he hasnt done before new training methods and stuff like that
4955752 we are going to look at some different events mix up the training programme a little bit and do some experimenting
4955753 we have plenty of time and we will look at reinventing ourselves
4955754 we have accomplished this set of goals and i would dare to venture to say we are not going to do it again at least not like this
4955755 we will start coming up with some goals that excite him and start working towards them
4955756 i am looking forward to seeing friends hanging out and sitting down not moving
4955757 bob has a saying about putting money in the bank and this week was about making withdrawals i guess ive gotten through every penny now its time to start making redeposits
4955758 i dont want this sport to be an every four year sport
4955759 we get lots of attention every four years but for the rest of that time there is really not a lot of attention
4955760 we swim every single day there is never really an off season i just want more people to get involved in the sport and i think it will happen in the next four years
4955761 do what works and dont be afraid to look to other communities to see what works there
4955762 de vetcellen gaan niet weg en ze schreeuwen om meer
4955763 dat verklaart deels waarom het zo moeilijk is om je gewicht te behouden nadat je afgeslankt bent
4955764 de nieuwe vetcellen die je tijdens en na je gewichtsverlies krijgt moeten zich ook weer snel vullen met vetten
4955765 we made it our mission not to get caught and i think we did that
4955766 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
4955767 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
4955768 i convey it to the indian prime minister manmohan singhthat peace in the state will be a distant reality till meeting of our three demands our first demand is that all trade routes with ajk and pakistan including muzaffarabad road be immediately opened it is right of the people of the state
4955769 people have given their verdict that they wont tolerate oppression and injustice any more now it is time for the new delhi to act
4955770 police and troops opened indiscriminate fire on unarmed protestors in kashmir while in jammu no action is being taken against the rioters who are attacking and damaging muslim properties
4955771 this barbaric approach of india will never suppress the morale of kashmiri people
4955772 this is a march for freedom a march for honor and a march against occupation

4955775 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4955776 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4955777 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4955778 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4955779 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4955780 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4955781 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4955782 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4955783 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4955784 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4955785 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4955786 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4955787 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4955788 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4955789 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4955790 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4955849 we like to root for the home team as much as anyone but with the federal budget deep in the red the economy in the doldrums a broken military in need of repair and enormous unmet domestic needs we can think of a lot better places to invest federal resources than in building a sports machine let some rich benefactors augment the 130 million a year budget of the united states olympic committee if we are looking to invest in sports we would be wiser to spend money on daily gym classes and after school athletic programs that would not produce a large crop of olympians but it would help combat the growing obesity epidemic among american youngsters and yield health benefits worth more than olympic gold
4955850 the independence venue has been changed to a secret site it will not be held in public as it was in recent years

4955857 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
4955858 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
4955859 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4955860 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4955861 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4955862 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4955863 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4955864 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
4955865 it probably will intensify to a hurricane eventually if it stays south of cuba then jumps across cuba and heads to the north
4955866 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4955867 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4955868 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4955869 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4955870 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4955871 it cant be described well never ever see it again
4955872 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
4955873 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4955874 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4955875 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
4955876 ja det er rigtigt at jeg filmede jeg tager tr kket ind i banen og ser han kommer t t p mig og s falder jeg

4955881 godvertyfusde teringzeikerd die je daar bent stop dat gelul maar in je hol eikel
4955882 kijk een appelboom als appels niet rond zijn dan weet ik het ook niet meer
4955883 de appel is egaal en van organische vorm maar niet cirkelvormig rond en het klokkenhuis vormt een grove interruptie vos deze appel h is eigenlijk ook niet rond
4955884 dassie ik heb nog een ideetje daarvoor zullen we even bij mij thuis langs moeten
4955885 als wij het perfecte ronde ding niet kunnen vinden dan maken we het zelf
4955886 ga jij eens proberen om een perfecte cirkel te tekenen
4955887 welnee kerel je bent helemaal niet gek aan het worden
4955888 op deze manier ga je nooit een volmaakte cirkel ontdekken
4955889 denk eens aan die momenten dat je heerlijk hebt gegeten voelt je buik op die momenten niet volmaakt rond van alle lekkere hapjes
4955890 maar vos dat betekent dat een volle buik het volmaakte ronde is dat ik daar niet eerder aan heb gedacht
4955891 daarom dassie vind ik dat we nu het overheerlijk kippetje moeten verorberen dat ik zojuist overheerlijk heb klaargemaakt
4955892 ik ben niet de beste wel n van de beteren echter niet goed genoeg om beijing te halen achteraf gezien misschien over vier jaar nog een kans
4955893 menneke toch ik ben helemaal niet ge nteresseerd in succes ik wil naar beijing
4955894 tsja dat gaat niet zo n twee drie het kost jaren van investeren en dan weet je nog niets zeker
4955895 christiaan ik wens je een fijn leven kerel dit gedoe kost mij te veel tijd de vraag waar beijing ligt zal in mijn nabije toekomst door een ander worden beantwoord
4955896 prima kan mij gestolen worden als je eigenwijs wilt doen ok wat denkt iedereen toch altijd wel niet ze moesten eens weten
4955897 komaan kerel dat klinkt niet vrolijk kan het niet iets positiever
4955898 ik zoek iets dat perfect rond is maar kan me niet bedenken wat dat toch moet zijn
4955899 mag ik vragen waarom je iets zoekt dat nu juist perfect rond is waarom geen perfecte rechthoek of pentagram
4955900 omdat ik me afvraag waarom de dingen zijn zoals ze zijn wat heeft alles voor zin als perfectie niet bestaat
4955901 zeg dassie hoe zou je het vinden als jij en ik samen op zoek zouden gaan naar iets perfects ronds zou dat niet mooi zijn
4955902 ja vos dit slakkenhuis is rond maar hij heeft te veel lijnen over zijn huisje lopen en is alleen rond vanaf de zijkant gezien als je hem van voren of achter ziet dan is het eigenlijk gewoon een niet rond ding

4956114 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4956115 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson

4956123 you can see the dirty tricks beginning in their campaign it is corrupt and immoral to use religion and the koran
4956124 dont insult the religion of islam by playing political games
4956125 they will probably try to convince voters that islam is under threat and that malay rights are under threat

4956132 a swift drop in oil and natural gas prices coupled with nervous equity markets have battered several canadian energy stocks to prices well below our estimates of their long term fair value
4956133 building wind facilities in the corridor that stretches from the texas panhandle to north dakota could produce 20 percent of the electricity for the united states at a cost of 1 trillion it would take another 200 billion to build the capacity to transmit that energy to cities and towns thats a lot of money but its a one time cost and compared to the 700 billion we spend on foreign oil every year its a bargain
4956134 when the month of ramadhan starts a great month has come over you a blessed month a month in which allah has made it compulsory upon you to fast by day in this month the gates of the heaven are opened and the gates of the hell are closed and the devils are chained this is the month in which is a night better than a thousand months

4956154 barack obama has the unique ability to bring people together from all political backgrounds democrats republicans and independents partisan business as usual has crippled washington its time for a president who will work to unite our country and bring about the change we need
4956155 barack obama will stand up for alaskas families as president hell support the alaska natural gas pipeline and work to lower the skyrocketing fuel prices that have caused an energy crisis here in fairbanks he has a plan to move this country forward and will be a president who is as independent as alaskans are
4956156 im grateful for mayor whitakers support fairbanks residents are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country mayor whitaker knows firsthand the importance of solving our energy crisis he believes as i do that we need to bring people together in order to solve the many challenges our country is facing right now from energy to the economy

4956167 the democratic party is a party of inclusion we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party
4956168 strongly and unequivocally supports roe vs wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4956169 also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
4956170 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4956171 i do think that those who diminish the moral elements of the decision arent expressing the full reality of it
4956172 what this does is commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child and for the woman facing this question in terms of pre and post natal healthcare in terms of income support the kind of support like paternity leave family leave and an improvement in the accessibility in adoption these are tangible things and very much related to catholic social teachings
4956173 at the heart of the matter though is this fact criminalizing abortion does not end abortion it just results in more lives lost so how do we as a society help pregnant women and their partners feel confident that they have options beyond abortion i like the new platform i hope it can help us begin to bridge the gap

4956181 any money that retirees take out of their portfolios or that they lose in market declines in the first five years of retirement has a higher cost because its money that wont be invested to earn returns in succeeding years when the markets recover
4956182 and the less they have invested after a bear market the less potential they have to benefit from the compounding of any earnings in subsequent years
4956183 psychologically people find it hard to retire when the market is down 20 percent
4956184 thats a self imposed discipline that retirees would be wise to adhere to
4956185 you want to figure out what is the right portfolio mix for you and to also understand or have a realistic sense of how bumpy the risk is likely to be

4956260 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
4956261 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love

4956280 when i got to the door a boy answered he was about six years old and wearing superman underoos do you believe that underoos
4956281 he just looked at me quietly while i explained to him about the car and asked if his father was home then he ran off into the kitchen and left the door open
4956282 i followed him i had a vague sense of d j vu or something in the living room i realized right away the familiarity but i couldnt believe i didnt understand
4956283 my father lay on the floor next to the rifle and my mother sat at the kitchen table crying
4956284 i dont understand it either but i swear to you i saw them
4956285 then i remembered i remembered all of it i was in a daze it was like i was watching myself i mean i was watching myself but i dont know how to explain it my mother looked up at me her face worn from crying she asked if i was from the sheriffs office
4956286 i realized i was too late to save him the burglar had come and gone already
4956287 i knelt down and remembered what the man told me that night twenty three years ago
4956288 i knew we should have left earlier why didnt we leave earlier
4956289 it was you you were the strange man that night
4956290 i think ive solved another one an old one this time

4956294 they said he musta been here two days at least staring at that tv
4956295 well by the looks of this place he sure liked his murder mysteries
4956296 i was never one for mysteries and such though your dad talked all the time about em
4956297 one of these days i always thought one of these days hes going to figure one out by god
4956298 he was a decent man never gave me a bit of trouble
4956299 cats not in the lease you know no pets it says
4956300 i just hope i can raise him better than i did old nelson there
4956301 its gonna take a while to get all your dads stuff cleared out i guess
4956302 i suppose you can keep the place til the end of the month so you can clean it out and all

4956305 no i mean a specific robbery up in erie about nine years ago
4956306 my dad was just a crime nut who thought he was a master detective
4956307 all the same id like to take a look around if i could
4956308 oh its for nothing probably but we do this sort of thing all the time
4956309 we have a whole forensic team that can comb through this stuff like hounds

4956546 we lost our wide receiver ansel ponder and we lost shaun brooks so somebody has to step up and take these plays
4956547 i think will and jake and donte are going to help me everybody has got to do it
4956548 hes a great kid along with a lot of the others theyve all worked hard and just hopefully good things will happen for them
4956549 i thought for the first scrimmage that offensively we moved the ball pretty decent
4956550 defensively weve got to make some changes in there because what makes it look bad is youre running against the single wing which we never play against so that makes it look bad
4956551 all in all there are a few things on offense that we have to correct and several things on defense
4956552 we lost some real good seniors leadership wise and everything and i really appreciate the job they did for us last year
4956553 unfortunately theyre gone and some new guys are going to have to step in and hopefully that is what is going to happen
4956554 will did a good job at quarterback putting it on the outside of my shoulder like hes supposed to and we got a touchdown with it
4956555 all i did was read the wide receivers eyes and i could tell what it was so i took advantage of it
4956556 we did good weve got to get ready for graham and this is going to make us more ready said patterson a two time all class aa performer
4956557 this shows what you can actually do and they cant read all the plays
4956558 its like it always is there will be some bright spots from players and some stuff weve got to work on
4956559 overall well look at film and see how it went but im just happy to get back out here
4956560 were tired of hitting each other and practicing the same old same old every day they get tired of the same old routine all the time but overall they have a good attitude and hopefully it will continue to get better
4956561 hes bigger faster and stronger and hes got that year of experience and that is going to make a big difference for him
4956562 as i said this is our first scrimmage so were looking forward to correcting all those next week and look better down at charleston
4956563 now we can have an evaluation here saturday night and sunday at a coaches meeting whereas weve got that open date and we cant evaluate and you have to do the best you can with that
4956564 this is what scrimmages are for is to see where we need to improve
4956565 id like to open up with them but theres nothing we can do about it so were not worried
4956566 im excited because we have worked hard and thats why we coach because we love to do it and im excited with this bunch
4956567 theres so much history here so much talent in here such phenomenal memories its amazing how successful theyve been
4956568 we were down to them with about 40 seconds to go we went into maximum protection and had preston out there at end i said thats a touchdown he went up and grabbed the ball and the last 10 yards he backed in holding the ball out the coaches started yelling at him when he did that he was fantastic
4956569 knocked me about 20 feet onto my back but i caught him on the sideline and burnt him up
4956570 nobody would come down the field on special teams like smitty they all said he was crazy
4956571 had a bond that you wouldnt believe the personalities the attitudes they were all good people just country boys
4956572 it was just like a little child getting a new bicycle at christmas its a blessing for everyone to get back together
4956573 were really here to clear the air about who was the best athlete and we all know who that is since i was captain of the football team and the basketball team
4956574 in practice wed ride him and holler at him but when the game came he was the best hed go right in there and play with the best of them
4956575 we saw some interesting stuff but everybody was glad to get home
4956576 ill never be able to thank coach colobro enough for getting me started in this business hes a great friend and theres lots of great friends in this room
4956577 he knew football and he was fair he could get on you but he could pick you up
4956578 you could come to him with problems and they didnt have to be football problems his door was open he was a good man to play for and hes still a good man
4956579 we got one day off but it really paid off we became real real close
4956580 made my life pleasant you build a friendship up like this and you become a family thats how i feel about a lot of these people like theyre part of my family
4956581 we may not have been the winningest but we were always well received by the community for homecoming we always had a huge crowd
4956582 it also gave the kids in high school a brighter outlook the knew they could stay home and play and most importantly it offered them a good education
4956583 a good thing because weve never really had anything like this
4956584 we need you im almost 80 in order to sustain what bluefield state college deserves it is necessary that people work to keep the memories alive
4956585 our duty is to act decisively and make tax and spending decisions that show we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
4956586 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the higher earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
4956587 it is a little weird to be a two year starter and still have your job in question but part of college football is youve always got the challenge of people coming from behind you
4956588 tyrod is a talented person and it is tough to keep great athletes off the field that is my challenge to keep a great athlete off the field
4956589 whatever the coaches ask from us obviously i am going to be ok with
4956590 obviously if i had my druthers i would be out there every single snap but if they want to do that and think that is the best thing for the team then ill make the most of the time that i am in there
4956591 i had the same mentality then i was competing with ike and cory then but i had the same mentality that youre the guy until the coaches tell you otherwise so im going to take it the same way
4956592 i guess it would be nice to have a little piece of mind but to be honest with you im not worried about it
4956593 im not losing any sleep over it i have faith i am going to be out there and as long as i keep working hard and competing and playing to my ability it will all work out
4956594 in my time at virginia tech i have never had a moment to relax rather it was after a bad bowl game and i came back and i had more competition and now tyrod is here and i have more competition so my job has never been written in stone
4956595 it may make you lose a few hairs at night but it has made me a better quarterback because the best way to get better is competition
4956596 thats all you can do really in the end its not my decision all i can do is do the best i can do and move the offense and make accurate passes and good reads while im in there and the rest of it is up to them
4956597 to be honest i guess if he ends up being the full time starter and im not that will end up being a blow to me but im taking the mentality that i am going to be the guy
4956598 i look at it that way and that way if and when i am the guy it will be no adjustment to my mentality and so thats just how im approaching it every day like i am going to be the quarterback every snap
4956599 ive grown up a lot i think im pretty mature for my age
4956600 i have dealt with life is full of disappointments and criticisms full of ups and downs
4956601 ive gone from highs to high and ive gone lows to lows and my parents keep telling me to get used to it thats how life so i think i have experienced a lot for a 22 year old
4956602 ive thought about that since i was a little kid but now that it is really around the corner and it is realistic its definitely got me excited
4956603 that is how i approach the starting job you just do the best you can focus on yourself and it will work out
4956604 focus on the season help the team win football games move the ball down the field and score points and the rest will take care of itself
4956605 we dont want to change anything what coach steve ragsdale has established here is proven
4956606 it works and it is successful and we pretty much told them boys no radical changes
4956607 really i am what coach ragsdale has done not just for the football program but for this school and this community is overwhelming
4956608 what he has accomplished over 30 years of coaching and now me being the head football coach i am stepping into some big shoes thats expected
4956609 we were hoping he could go at least five more years but he just came up to me one day and asked me if i would be interested in the job and i told him yeah sure
4956610 weve got 25 kids on the roster weve got two starters on offense and two starters on defense returning from last year and thats between three kids weve got 11 that return from the actual roster last year
4956611 it was just exciting tech football hadnt really taken off has now but you could tell when coach beamer came in that he had a strong vision
4956612 he had his goals set and what he wanted to accomplish and he got them and right now theyre one of the top football teams in the country
4956613 he always talked about great things and it kind of worked out really good im glad the school hung in there with him when times were tough so he could get where he wanted to be
4956614 i was on the defensive side of the ball so it wasnt a big difference i was probably one of the smallest guys and slowest guys on the team
4956615 it was fun i was a walk on i think i might have played in three plays my whole career there
4956616 in beamers last year i was on the traveling squad so it was real fun and exciting just to be a part of something that is really so big and huge now
4956617 i have no idea right now were just looking ahead to blacksburg and game one and well take it one week at a time
4956618 what i like to do is look to the week ahead that is coming up and just work on that week and just go from there
4956619 usually as an assistant coach you dont have to do a lot of thinking about things and schemes
4956620 youre concentrating on one area but as a head coach youre just overwhelmed with everything and there is a lot of things going on
4956621 i really believe in the way he did things and how he did things and i think of all the things he did and i truly believe in him full charge office manager
4956622 this is actually a community service project for our girls
4956623 as a program we wanted to reach the youth of the area cause volleyballs not very big in this area
4956624 this is their thing so im not running any of the practices
4956625 they planned the practice plan and they really executed it well theyve been hands on with each one of the participants
4956626 its brought them closer together as a team having to do something like this
4956627 some of them are wanting to be coaches so this has been good experience for them theyve just completely ran the drills and i think theyve learned the importance of reaching out to the young ladies
4956628 it helps them to focus as well on what theyre doing
4956629 because if theyre instructing others to do things its reminding them the small things like their approach and how high to reach
4956630 theyre learning everything that they need to know to put a rotation together
4956631 theyre learning offense defense theyre learning passing setting hitting serving they get a demo from the bluefield college girls theyll do a demo of the drill so they understand how its supposed to be executed and then they go into it and they do it
4956632 theyre enjoying it to teach and to interact with the young ladies of the community
4956633 were very thankful for bluefield college to come out and to have this
4956634 the bluefield college players take the time to break down the skills and they work one on one with the girls weve taken full advantage of it
4956635 were really trying to get out into the community a lot more and thats really what this is for so our players can learn how to interact with the community get to know that theres other things out there other than bluefield college
4956636 i hope that they learn not only how to play volleyball not only to learn the drills to learn the correct approach and how to hit which theyre learning in their schools
4956637 but i hope that one day that they could look up to our girls and see that theyre playing college volleyball that theres an opportunity for them if they want and if they want to work hard enough
4956638 other things like how big the town is everything like that doesnt really matter its great weather and a good field to play on its all you need
4956639 its kind of divided one halfs like a desert the other halfs mountains and trees
4956640 since i was a little kid i guess i always played every year
4956641 everybody did it the kids i went to school with they just played at recess or whatever and i signed up to play little league
4956642 i just loved to do it i played a bunch and some of us are a little bit better i guess
4956643 i struggled until my senior year and had a good year and was really going to play football in college but i wasnt really big enough to play football
4956644 a bunch of my friends had always wanted to play college baseball they went to a recruiting trip to some schools and stuff and i just came along with them i ended up getting a scholarship to a junior college
4956645 i had a good year there and one of the coaches knew a scout for the baltimore orioles
4956646 i did a workout for them i guess he liked what he saw and he gave me a chance
4956647 in college the no 1 guy was the best guy
4956648 but there everybody was a little bit better so it was like facing the no 1 guy every day
4956649 a lot of latin players and stuff a lot of guys that dont speak very good english a lot of spanish
4956650 and it was a little weird though it wasnt too crazy
4956651 it just makes it a lot harder when its that much different than youre used to your whole life
4956652 and offensively i struck out a lot more times than i should have but im learning
4956653 ive got to put the ball in play at least and have a chance to beat out a ground ball or something like that cause im not really a home run hitter or a power hitter i put the ball in play a lot more but i feel like im doing o k
4956654 thats what i need to be trying to do its not really working out all the time but thats got to be part of my game is to put the ball in play and cut my strikeouts way down
4956655 the little things in professional baseball matter quite a bit like getting a sacrifice bunt down stuff like that
4956656 and just going 2 for 4 every night or whatever and moving guys over its 0 for 1 but you moved them over and you helped the team out
4956657 the junior college i went to was in a pretty small town and i really enjoyed it there
4956658 and the fields way nice here and the weathers awesome
4956659 places to eat and its all you need really you can focus on baseball and theres not a whole lot of distractions as far as nightlife stuff like that
4956660 hopefully theyll let me come back next year and play somewhere with the orioles
4956661 i need to get a better understanding of what kind of player they want me to be what kind of player i can be follow through i guess learn how to play the game the way its supposed to be played

4956663 we talked a little bit about the road trip the opportunity to now that were in a race the opportunity to show what we can do
4956664 its huge were now battling it out were trying to get to the playoffs
4956665 i come in and whatever they want me to do and i do it
4956666 i just wanted to come in and throw strikes and not walk people
4956667 my whole approach today was just to put up solid at bats
4956668 the survey text is art history at its most grandiose promising to reveal the complex truths of humanity through art it is also
4956669 art history at its most political reducing cultural and individual differences to questionable hierarchies and generalities
4956670 the writing of a completely acceptable overview of arts history impossible under any circumstance has been rendered even more absurd by the growing pluralism within our field which is why i think it may be time to rethink the entire introductory enterprise
4956671 a collection of separate lengthy and in depth analyses of major monuments a book that would leave the issues of continuity to the individual instructor
4956672 that such a book might include essays that offer competing points of view on a given work or monument perhaps what we need in this area given the methodological diversity within our field is a range of quite different options
4956673 the authority of the panoptic gaze and the privileged perspective
4956674 stop using the present generation of survey textbooks those who teach the course must get hold of its agenda
4956675 teach the conflicts the actual debate and disagreement that constitute the scholarly process
4956676 follow the development of art through the twentieth century and up to the present day

4956683 ive bought a couple of those houses already that hes building you can build a house for us 150 000 which is amazing so i bought two of them and plan on buying more as theyre doing an amazing thing there

4956685 all these so called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking planning and strategy where they must stay
4956686 rumsfelds dismal strategic decisions resulted in the unnecessary deaths of american servicemen and women
4956687 responsible for america and her allies going to war with the wrong plan
4956688 violated fundamental principles of war dismissed deliberate military planning ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of saddam hussein set the conditions for abu ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency disbanded iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most and constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive policy
4956689 with like minded and compliant subordinates who did not grasp the importance of the principles of war the complexities of iraq or the human dimension of warfare
4956690 tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy
4956691 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war
4956692 no other human activity gives it greater scope no other has such incessant and varied dealings with this intruder
4956693 union workers and officials at a tyson foods plant in tennessee said friday they have agreed to reinstate labor day as a paid holiday and the plant will also observe the muslim holiday eid al fitr this year tyson had previously agreed to drop labor day and substitute the muslim holiday as part of a new 5 year contract to accommodate muslim workers at the plant in shelbyville which is about 50 miles south of nashville the decision sparked widespread criticism from local politicians to talk radio to the internet the springdale ark based company said it requested reinstating labor day after complaints from plant workers and the public

4956700 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
4956701 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4956702 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4956703 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4956704 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4956705 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well

4956710 i dont underestimate the scale of the task facing the party but i do know where it should start it must get rid of the impression that its managerial pragmatic to the point where it has lost sight of principle and useless when it comes to delivery

4956727 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4956728 i dont think that anything will be resolved this weekend in south africa on saturday slammed zimbabwe president robert mugabes controversial re election as a blot on democracy the regrettable events leading to and including the holding of the run off elections on have no doubt left a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region
4956729 not only were these events alien to our region but they also brought into question in some quarters the integrity of sadc as an institution capable of promoting the rule of law and democratic governance

4956732 we want to be fair with betis as the first option next week it will be defined between betis or roma
4956733 we obviously have a lot to analyse and to take care of

4956735 i dont want to be sacked but maybe it is one line that chelsea will follow
4956736 because at chelsea if you dont win it is bad i know that if you dont win the fans dont like it the players want to kill themselves and the coach asks himself why didnt i win
4956737 i have a contract for two years and i will try and stay for two years
4956738 i could get the information in a split second as opposed to digging around in the parts

4956740 you cant deny that frankies voice is an extraordinary instrument like nothing people had ever heard before
4956741 but i soon found myself being more drawn to studying jazz meeting louis armstrong when i was a teenager was the thrill of my life
4956742 it was time to leave the schooling and just write my own i went for as simple a song as i could three chords and eight words in the lyric
4956743 is that it broke onto the r amp b charts weeks before it made it in the regular market
4956744 if i had my druthers and my mother would have let me have a drum kit in the house i would have played that instead of the piano
4956745 but as it was all of our songs are based on a strong rhythmic figure you usually hear the drums first and a lot of people can recognize what song it is just from that
4956746 the kids didnt leave us when the beatles came along
4956747 they kept listening to both of us and thats a tribute to bobs music
4956748 this needed to be different no falsetto a clear cut separation between what frankie did with the seasons and what he did solo
4956749 it sat in the can because nobody knew what to make of it it walked the line between pop and easy listening we were in never never land because the whole radio market was splintered by then
4956750 keeping the integrity of the music and understanding how its an important part of everyones life
4956751 if i am in the theatre with frankie i look at him out of the corner of my eye and wonder how hes taking it tonight

4956824 un sacerdote como yo y un obispo pero no un sacerdote cualquiera ni un obispo cualquiera sino sacerdote y obispo de la liberaci n lo cual significa que han elegido un libertador
4956825 el hecho tambi n de que sea un hombre que ha abrazado la pobreza voluntaria certifica que estar libre de toda corrupci n que es el mal m s grande ahora del planeta entonces est n libre de eso y tienen un libertador

4956829 en realidad la iglesia siempre ha reconocido el principio de la guerra justa y por lo tanto de la guerrilla justa no
4956830 claro cuando hay otros medios de alcanzar el poder como ha sido ac como ha sido tambi n en bolivia eso es lo que hay que hacer
4956831 no el de las armas porque no se ve ninguno sentido en esa lucha ya que ha cambiado tambi n de objetivo desde hace mucho tiempo

4956834 yo tambi n sigo con esta represi n pero estoy muy contento con ella porque esto me libera de tener que estar sujeto a las autoridades eclesi sticas que no son como el obispo que ustedes ten an aqu que todav a es obispo porque ser obispo para siempre como algunos que han habido unos obispos que han sido corruptos

4956870 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4956910 linkedin and zerodegrees are two of the more popular services that facilitate business oriented connections and some argue these and similar sites are now doing a better job at connectivity than ever before remember metcalfes law coined by the inventor of ethernet which states that the power of a network grows in proportion to the square of the number of its nodes thats a geeky way of saying that networking technologies nobody uses are of limited value as the popularity of sns sites grows so does their value because a larger number of users mean better odds for productive connections
4956911 where linkedin emphasizes scale and jobster emphasizes specialization visible path a start up based in new york focuses on the strength of individual relationships the firm analyses e mail traffic calendars and diary entries to identify the strongest relationships that exist inside and outside a company an obvious application is to generate leads a salesman can use the service to identify who within his network has the closest links to a prospect and request an introduction

4956916 the door was closed but not locked because we were expecting more people
4956917 suddenly it opened and two men appeared with guns in their hands they wanted to know whose corolla was parked in the driveway and demanded the keys to it
4956918 i gave it to them then they asked if there were any anti theft devices and i said that there was only the factory fitted one they also took my wallet which contained about r1 000
4956919 one checked the rooms to see if there were others in the house they shoved us all into a room and turned the lights off they then locked the house and took the keys
4956920 we urge temples and churches to keep us informed about when and where they are holding services as it has become a trend to target devotees

4956923 this is a far reaching infringement on the sabcs independence as public broadcaster the reason for the amendment of the broadcasting act is directly linked to the power struggle and change of leadership in the anc
4956924 alarm bells should be sounding over the abuse of democracy when a ruling party finds it necessary to amend laws in order to solve internal short term problems
4956925 it consists of the president acting in consultation with the speaker of the national assembly
4956926 this is surely antithetical to the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers the president leads the executive authority of the state while the speaker is the executive officer only for parliament as an institution not the republic
4956927 he can hardly be asked to perform the purely executive aspects of this function in consultation with another arm of state
4956928 the fact that our speaker is the chairperson of the anc is an unhappy political reality which simply underscores but has no bearing on the legal point
4956929 to stand up against the us led forces in afghanistan and drive them out
4956930 all 37 allies in nato will be humiliated and driven out of afghanistan jihad is compulsory and will continue until the end of time we are without resources but we have the support of god
4956931 president george w bush and his allies have decided to kill us or arrest us they consider us as weak and think of themselves as all powerful
4956932 they think they can enslave poor afghans bomb us with their planes and gunship helicopters they think they have everything and we are voiceless the media are with them and they belittle our resistance we kill 80 and they report two or one i promise the afghan nation that soon we will be victorious
4956933 they projected the rumor that jalaluddin haqqani had died in dubai in the united arab emirates i am neither a shopkeeper nor a trader that i would travel to dubai neither am i a politician who roams all around the world the americans thought that with their developed technology they could plant the news of my death in the media but now the media are realizing their lies to demoralize the mujahideen
4956934 what the government is doing is only counting the soldiers that die in action on the ground before they can get them into a hummer helicopter or ambulance any soldier who is shot but they get into a vehicle before the die is not counted
4956935 uranium poisoning which can take decades to kill not only the soldier but family members as well
4956936 the u s iraq nuclear holocaust by mass represents between fourteen and twenty eight thousand hiroshimas from a uranium poisoning perspective in hiroshima 70 thousand died from the blast and 70 thousand died from uranium poisoning
4956937 the nuclear waste the u s has exploded into the middle east will continue killing for billions of years and could wipe out a third of life on earth winds can and will blow the uranium dust from the u s weapons around the world gulf war veterans and civilians who have ingested the uranium will continue to die off from uranium poisoning over a number of decades
4956938 so far more than one million people have been slaughtered and four million are homeless as a consequence of the u s s illegal invasion of iraq and afghanistan birth defects are up 600 in iraq the same will apply to u s veterans children
4956939 thats right those tanks you saw exploding into flame as our troops invaded other nations were being hit with dirty bombs
4956940 it turns out the uranium from nuclear waste is very dense and possesses pyrophoric properties
4956941 now our boys in the military have not been firing just one or two of these dirty bomb bullets and bunker busters they have been letting loose a hail of death in iraq alone during the two invasions more than one thousand eight hundred and twenty tons of depleted uranium dirty bomb bullets and bombs were blasted into that innocent nation

4956945 so to come here when it was freezing cold and come on it was difficult for him
4956946 but he made a difference for the first 10 15 minutes he was on just in terms of experience

4956986 melissa she called me melissa whats wrong even when i tried to deny it she still knew she would absoulutly love big sexy and would probably call him that she would love the fact that im home she would also adore the fact that im at emmanuel i realize the most important thing she gave me was a legacy the dna evidence that she is alive in me she has always been my kindred spirt we had a connect like no other we laughed and cried she was there when i had my surgeries my kids birth and thru all the other times of life she was greatest cheerleader when i began thinking about returning to school i miss her i do know she is looking down from heaven probablly chasing st peter and telling him how to hold his fork the relationship that i had with her i only hope to continue with my children and grandchildren god mandates us to raise our children up into adults with a passion for christ adults who seek him first and however fallable we may be still knowing god is in control i am privleged to know that my life even the bratty spoiled child in me was fashioned by god that he is still creating in me a greater understanding of who he is i am often asked

4957007 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
4957008 no all four rounds he didnt do what we were telling him
4957009 third round i came out firing i was thinking that maybe id be up by two points but they said it was tied up
4957010 in that last round i went in there with my hands up i know i hit him with a straight left he caught me with the hook ill give them that but i think i caught him with two more punches and should have won the fight 8 7
4957011 we wanted him to box but the main thing we wanted him to do was get up early get ahead first we knew he had faster hands and more power so we wanted him to engage and make the guy have to come to him
4957012 instead they started playing the waiting game from the beginning we yelled at him talked to him between rounds but he basically did the opposite of what we asked him to do
4957013 one of the things we know is that these kids have been calling home so often
4957014 what happens is they get instructions all the way from the united states you can tell the difference because once the bell rings they start doing what their other coaches tell them
4957015 they were trying to tell me to just go at him go at him
4957016 im not that type of fighter to go out there and throw punches if i do that im going to get caught with shots i want to go out there and play it smart
4957017 luis was actually a very aggressive boxer until tonight one of the things thats always helped luis is his aggression but for some reason tonight he decided to stand back and wait and it cost him
4957018 before i came up here i talked to my dad its hard i feel like i let him down
4957019 yes i was born in russia but since for so many years ive lived in the u s i feel i represent the united states of america
4957020 i feel like im more of an american than a russian but im very proud of my heritage and proud of being a russian
4957021 i go back at least once a year and visit my grandparents and my family and friends
4957022 it makes it so special to me i always feel a little more russian when im there
4957023 it is a pity that nastya sic is now an american
4957024 i definitely feel that i went out there today and represented both countries
4957025 i am competing for the u s but with my name being nastia i hope i made my family and fans proud in russia as well as in the united states
4957026 america gave me many opportunities i dont think i would have been able to achieve the same results in russia 15 years ago it was just not possible
4957027 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned and it helped me
4957028 i wouldnt have done it without the help of the team
4957029 we came together as a unit of the three olympics ive been a part of this by far is the closest mens team weve ever had
4957030 it is fitting that at one of the most significant events of our generation we have witnessed one of the greatest performances in olympic history michaels record breaking performance during these games will inspire millions of people around the world to reach for their goals and aspire to greatness he is an example of the very best values of the olympic movement and our country
4957031 from winning by one one hundreth to doing a best time in every event its been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and nothing but fun for me

4957101 the costs of a private security contract are comparable with those of a u s military unit performing similar functions
4957102 we support it because we want to make sure the mob isnt glorified in any way
4957103 we need to make sure they present some symmetry that they show the other side
4957104 the mayors been very involved in this from day one

4957107 absolutely jim gibbons is the worst public official ive ever seen
4957108 his gaffe after gaffe after gaffe this latest thing about him getting a tax break on his land i think hes in real trouble
4957109 if you cant kick a man when hes down when can you kick him
4957110 insisted that gibbons has been actively campaigning and effectively fundraising on behalf of state and local gop candidates
4957111 you know their behavior alone oftentimes excludes them from participation in this program because theyre not under our guidelines innocent victims of crime they participated in the crime on some level
4957112 being violently assaulted by someone inebriated or not is a violation of your personhood
4957113 the idea that you are going to sit around and figure out what percentage of the blame you are going to ascribe to the victim themselves is just completely misguided and improper
4957114 a case by case review is only as good as the rules that govern that review discretion vested in officials should not turn into a character assassination of the victim or be used to play out archaic gender stereotypes
4957115 just would not look at drugs and alcohol on sexual assault cases
4957116 due to limited crime compensation funding it appears that compensation officers are forced to look for reasons not to provide funds rather than reasons to provide funds
4957117 the elephant in the room is not the issue of denial because of contributory conduct
4957118 when you start putting blame on other people without looking at your own internal procedures there is a problem
4957119 advocates are just as busy as victims of crime compensation we all need to work together to make sure victims are getting the help they need

4957121 he was a loveable lad who was never really in trouble
4957122 someone told me that connor was thought to have said something to someone which he denied
4957123 it all then got out of hand and there was a commotion and he ended up getting stabbed
4957124 he wasnt the sort of lad who would look for trouble but he would back himself up
4957125 connor was a member of a loving family though he was known to the police but not for anything serious
4957126 as of yet there is no motive but it is very early days
4957127 since july 2007 when judge halverson was suspended more than 180 000 has been paid to senior judges who have spent at least a portion of their time covering for her absence
4957128 senior judges assigned to judge halversons courtroom since january may also preside over drug court sessions
4957129 drug court has expanded its days in court and only about a quarter of the more than 90 000 spend on senior judges who were assigned to judge halversons cases actually involved covering for judge halverson

4957137 the rocky mountain states are undergoing a tremendous transformation the republican party has not recognized if its going to maintain its dominance its going to have to change to changing circumstances

4957139 california was a swing state and now its a democratic state
4957140 were seeing younger people young hispanics getting involved in politics more than they used to
4957141 we need to reach out to these populations and meet their needs or we will disappear
4957142 the little kids all wanna grow up to be politicians
4957143 congress is finally losing patience with the indefensible image of americans paying historic high gasoline prices while iraq pockets huge profits and americans underwrite iraqs rebuilding
4957144 the three trillion dollar war the true cost of the iraq conflict
4957145 the oil windfall is yet another example of the ongoing financial fallout of the war which is costing the u s more than 13 billion a month not counting the future costs of caring for war veterans and replenishing military equipment
4957146 none of the work weve done there since is adequate compensation for the five years of suffering that the iraqi people have endured
4957147 but at a time when the u s economy is weak and our own bridges roads and airports are in desperate need of repair there is a real question of whether we can sustain subsidizing iraqs rebuilding on this scale
4957148 obama unlike most democrats who come up here and die has a shot of if not winning the north doing well in the north
4957149 theres more moderate pro choice republicans in washoe county than probably anywhere else in the state and given the current environment i think theyll be under significant pressure from both sides

4957157 having added strength up front is a situation i really enjoy
4957158 ideally i like to operate with four experienced strikers as we did when we won the treble when we had andy cole dwight yorke teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer
4957159 it was an admirable strength to have when it came to the end of the season and we were competing on three fronts with key games coming at us thick and fast
4957160 if our plans do not come to fruition it is hardly the end of the road
4957161 from here it is a continuation with my goal of raising the sport of swimming as high as i can in the us 70 000 fans will be watching the relay at the nfl ravens game tonight the team based in his home town of baltimore and it has been shown at sports events across the country
4957162 i have heard people say its crazy they are out to dinner and swimming is on the television
4957163 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
4957164 after the 200 im i started to think we could get there that was when i allowed myself to believe a little bit it was pretty exciting
4957165 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
4957166 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
4957167 michael phelps you cant put it in words what he has done here his level of achievement is phenomenal and i dont think it will ever be seen again
4957168 do not think that i am rich because of this small salary you pay me because i dont even know where my wife puts it
4957169 we are supposed to get monthly financial facilitation from the government the situation is however bad because this money has never come in time
4957170 amy was in a right state slurring her words and falling all over the place
4957171 madonna detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother it showed a side of her that made her very human
4957172 but i think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him
4957173 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4957174 i read the script and the very human story and the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
4957175 this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
4957176 il marchait le premier sur l troite corniche tout au bord du gouffre et elle le suivait glissant contre le mur les yeux baiss s pour ne pas voir le trou b ant sous eux mue pr sent presque d faillante de peur cramponn e la main quil tendait vers elle mais elle le sentait fort sans d faillance s r de sa t te et de son pied et elle pensait ravie malgr sa frayeur
4957177 the man cut off her head in the presence of the children for how long are we going to suffer with no one to protect us from brutality
4957178 this is horrible how do you kill your wife before knowing your status you could be the source of infection and you blame it on a woman who has gone for a test killing somebody doesnt mean that you are going to get rid of hiv
4957179 we have good cooperation and both countries are working hard to keep the healthy relationship
4957180 the kenyan government has told us that kabuga is not in kenya and that they will arrest him if he lands on their territory
4957181 yes we have registered another accident this morning where another gateway bus bound for kampala was ambushed by jie warriors the conductor was shot dead while the driver and other ten passengers were seriously injured and are hospitalised at matany hospital
4957182 you see these karimojong think they are very important and that they should be left with guns to have their own government i cant allow this and we are going to deal with them
4957183 all the organs that are supposed to create checks and balances are not working it is mainly a management problem
4957184 the headmasters of these schools have not been put under pressure to produce they dont have targets
4957185 governance is important the people who run the schools are they up to the task
4957186 some of the senior 4 students will pay tuition when they come to collect their results next year a thing not possible in kampala
4957187 who are qualified but not motivated most of these teachers after graduating tend to go to areas of opportunity urban schools tend to take the best teachers
4957188 are the teachers adequately trained and what about the curriculum the two go hand in hand like the priest and the bible
4957189 we would like to see the school improve its performance and we are working on it
4957190 the dominant factor for the schools woes had to do with management we think that the matter is being adequately addressed
4957191 if an old students association is there i dont know much about it
4957192 if there is any it is not active even during the time i was at the school starting in 1995 some of the buildings were really dilapidated there was something about old students that wasnt working
4957193 budo is not just a school it is a brand and it is made so by its alumni
4957194 over and above everything else the only thing a school can show is its alumni
4957195 when still in its bud in the late 1950s the school rose to the highest ranks in the country in both academic and co curricular activities
4957196 the brilliant performance was steadily maintained until the dark days of the 1970s and early 1980s however with the stability of the political atmosphere in the country the rays of excellence have shone again on ntare school since 1990 the academic performance has been improving year after year
4957197 there has been a process of transition from having inspection as a department in the ministry headed by a commissioner to being a fully fledged directorate
4957198 is weak and they need to strengthen it by funding it and giving it the right personnel
4957199 the idea of saying that we havent been doing anything is wrong
4957200 we are more professional we dont go kicking teachers around we do inspection quietly and it emphasises support supervision
4957201 like it used to be i just come incognito and see what i find today inspectors do not even have transport
4957202 three quarters of the teachers teach in some private schools have you heard of a teacher being penalised for that
4957203 many of these schools are failing because they have poor boards
4957204 many readers who read the novel on the blog are buying the hard copies because they want to keep it it is hard to read the serially released novel everyday also those who dont read the novel are choosing the book because of familiarity
4957205 so the contents are becoming an important weapon for the survival for the online bookstores i think other online bookstores might follow suit for the posting of the novels on their web sites
4957206 weve decided to upload jungs new novel on the internet first to draw more young readers into literature

4957467 he was friends with my sister and we met about nine years ago hanging out in a neighborhood park
4957468 we were at a family party at marina del ray and he got down on his knee and proposed down by the water it was really romantic
4957469 i decided i was open to exploring relationships and he asked me out
4957470 i was kind of expecting it later so i was happy to have that little surprise
4957471 even while she was going to school in florida for a while
4957472 we were at dinner and i just put the ring on the table and let it sit there until she noticed it
4957473 so even though she knew it was coming she didnt know when and was still pretty surprised
4957474 we had a band playing dominican and spanish music even three months later were hearing that it was the best wedding ever
4957475 it was a perfect day in every way it could not have been better
4957476 we knew we had a really strong connection so we decided to go for it
4957477 the last clue was in the bedroom and he was on his knee with candles and roses everywhere
4957478 my friend said just go on a date with him
4957479 when i walked into my classroom in the morning with all my kids he was there with the ring
4957480 i just made the kids play all day i couldnt work after that

4957514 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4957515 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers
4957516 i think the issue is that the army is a professional army what we are concerned about is the abuse of that army and if tsvangirai is head of government then whoever is in cabinet as a minister of defence would be answerable to morgan tsvangirai

4957601 super ich f hle mich wirklich unheimlich wohl ich bin froh dass das alles geklappt hat ich war im vergangenen jahr noch in almeria beim sichtungstest dabei und danach hat sich audi f r mich entschieden dar ber bin ich sehr gl cklich bisher war die saison auch ganz gut ich geh re mit sechs punkten zur spitze der jahreswagenfahrer nat rlich gibt es immer ups und downs in einer saison aber das ist bei jedem fahrer so im gro en und ganzen bin ich jedoch bei der audi truppe absolut happy
4957602 f r die verpflichtung d rfte aber nicht nur der sichtungstest den ausschlag gegeben haben im vergangenen jahr hast du ja auch schon starke leistungen gezeigt
4957603 ja und ich denke doch dass man bei audi meine leistungen im 05er auto schon beurteilen konnte das hat sicherlich auch ein bisschen dazu beigetragen
4957604 mein ziel war vor allem bester vorjahreswagenfahrer zu sein und das war ich bis zum rennen am n rburgring nat rlich muss man als fahrer immer an sich arbeiten und das werde ich auch weiterhin machen man darf nicht stagnieren sondern muss immer schauen dass es vorw rts geht das werde ich bis zum ende der saison machen und dann hoffe ich dass ich dann wieder bester vorjahreswagenfahrer bin lacht anm d red
4957605 hattest du dir das leben als jahreswagenfahrer zuvor leichter vorgestellt im vergangenen jahr hatten die lteren fahrzeuge durchaus manchmal die chance zu gewinnen oder aufs podium zu fahren in diesem jahr ist das nicht mehr so
4957606 anscheinend war es im vergangenen jahr f r die vorjahreswagen ein bisschen leichter aber letztlich fahre ich meine rennen eigentlich haupts chlich gegen die anderen jahreswagen nat rlich will man als rennfahrer schon immer versuchen aufs podest zu kommen das ist ganz klar aber wenn es dazu nicht reicht reicht es eben nicht da muss man profi genug sein und versuchen das maximale aus sich und dem auto herauszuholen das wichtigste ist deshalb f r mich bester jahreswagenfahrer zu sein
4957607 ist es ein problem dass ihr als jahreswagenfahrer au erhalb der itr tests eigentlich auch keine testtage habt
4957608 das macht mir eigentlich nichts aus logisch als rennfahrer will man immer im auto sitzen weil es ja auch spa macht aber ich habe kein problem nach zwei drei oder vier wochen in denen ich nicht gefahren bin wieder ins auto zu steigen und auf anhieb wieder schnell zu sein wenn man das auto einmal gut kennt dann kennt man es einfach dann ist man nach ein paar runden gleich wieder drin
4957609 macht du dir auch hoffnungen irgendwann einen neuwagen zu bekommen
4957610 ganz klar jeder vorjahreswagenfahrer will irgendwann einmal ein neues auto haben dieses ziel muss man haben sonst ist man in der dtm wohl am falschen platz dieses ziel hat jeder und ich nat rlich auch ich versuche mein bestes zu geben aber es muss auch erst ein platz frei werden damit man ein neues auto bekommen kann im vergangenen jahr war zum beispiel alexandre pr mat der beste fahrer eines vorjahreswagens und er ist auch nicht gleich aufgestiegen einfach weil kein platz frei war deshalb mache ich mir dr ber im moment auch noch keine gedanken ich muss jetzt schauen dass ich den job den ich im moment zu erledigen habe gut mache dann m ssen wir am ende der saison weiterschauen
4957611 was machst du neben dem motorsport was sind deine hobbies
4957612 ich mache viel fitnesstraining fahre viel mit dem mountainbike und laufe hobbym ig betreibe ich auch kartsport das ist ein gutes fitnesstraining man trainiert die reflexe und bleibt einfach generell in schwung fr her habe ich viel modellbau betrieben und habe ferngesteuerte autos gebaut das mache ich jetzt aber nicht mehr
4957613 nein zu alt wird man da nie daf r lacht anm d red da gibt es leute die sind doppelt so alt wie ich und machen das immer noch professionell
4957614 ist die formel 1 noch ein ziel f r dich
4957615 nein gar nicht mehr die formel 1 habe ich definitiv abgehakt ich habe schon noch ein bisschen kontakt zum team und wir telefonieren hin und wieder da spricht man aber ber nichts gesch ftliches sondern nur dar ber wie es einem geht wie es l uft und solche dinge
4957616 ich sage ganz offen ich hatte nat rlich das ziel irgendwie in die formel 1 zu kommen sonst h tte ich es ja auch nicht als testfahrer versucht aber f r mich hat sich jetzt mit audi und der dtm eine m glichkeit geboten die f r mich viel interessanter war als bei spyker oder jetzt force india in der formel 1 hinterherzufahren dort h tte man auch keine visionen f r die zukunft haben k nnen das einzige ziel dort ist den teamkollegen zu schlagen ansonsten f hrt man die ganze zeit um die goldene ananas in der dtm hat man im vorjahresauto schon mehr ansporn man kann mehr fighten ich f hle mich sehr wohl in der dtm das ganze umfeld ist viel famili rer und lockerer es ist hochprofessionell aber dennoch alles ein bisschen lockerer als in der formel 1 und das macht mir auf jeden fall spa
4957617 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
4957618 it will be an authentic street circuit in the sense that it runs through the town centre unlike the melbourne or montreal tracks in terms of its charms and challenges the valencia race will probably come closest to the monaco grand prix i really like valencia which ive visited many times of course we do a lot of testing on the permanent race track in cheste and weve rolled out our new formula one car in valencia on several occasions the first few metres in a brand new car are always a very special experience
4957619 early this year i spent a few days in valencia with my family between the rollout and the next test
4957620 we had a great time went to the beach and in town theres a dried out riverbed that has nature parks and playgrounds that was very nice especially for the children valencia is also a great place for shopping and eating out needless to say and i love the contrast between its historic and futuristic architecture im looking forward to the weekend
4957621 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
4957622 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
4957623 a fear that youre not going to get to sleep at night
4957624 das m dchen sein das erst vom stuhl gekippt und dann im herrenklo gelegen ist
4957625 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
4957626 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4957627 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4957628 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
4957629 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
4957630 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
4957631 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through
4957632 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and issues have to be taken on their merits
4957633 i cant in good conscience support a law that i just dont agree with
4957634 well mainly because im not really as strong as i was but its very heart warming to know that many people still continue to remember ninoy and to remember him with good deeds
4957635 with regard to the agreement the provisions in the moa ad are not in accordance with the 1987 constitution so why did the government promise things that are not allowed in the constitution in the first place
4957636 the issue is now with the supreme court lets wait for its ruling and all will have to submit to it when it comes the highest tribunal is the final aribter it will rise above the din and noise created by less noble considerations
4957637 this trend may continue to worsen if current trajectories do not change

4957639 jai plus de mal avec dautres actions comme le fait de voir que plusieurs noms de rue lennik ont t couverts de croix gamm es ou lorsque certains menvoient des mails dans lesquels ils me comparent hitler visiblement en tant que flamand il nest plus possible de d fendre son identit sans tre trait de raciste ou de nazi les francophones nont que le mot tol rance la bouche lorsquil sagit deux mais touchez leurs privil ges dans le brabant flamand et ils oublient jusqu la signification de ce terme

4957645 il ny a aucun signe que les russes planifient leur retrait au contraire ils multiplient leurs points de contr le et fortifient leurs positions
4957646 the steps are only about two feet wide and you spiral your way down a bell tower to get out
4957647 it was just impossible to bring her out any other way than the way we did
4957648 the patient is deceased and the search has now been called off
4957649 im just really relieved to get back safe and sound after the ordeal up there
4957650 and im just glad its all over and im looking forward to sleeping in a bed tonight
4957651 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4957652 les bonnes relations entre la russie et les etats unis sont du pass
4957653 moscou a annonc le retour sans appel une r alit nostalgique dont tout le monde va devoir d sormais tenir compte la russie nest pas moins importante sur la sc ne internationale que lonu et lotan elle est tout autant autosuffisante pour faire la justice comme le monde a fait la justice au kosovo

4957667 ik had een vrije rol en heb zelfs even in de spits gespeeld
4957668 ik kwam vaak aan de bal en kon enkele goeie passes geven
4957669 ik weet dat ik een tijdje onder mijn niveau heb gespeeld en ik wil het niet als excuus gebruiken maar de wedstrijden tegen bate kwamen er al na amper twee weken training
4957670 dan weet je dat je op dat moment nog niet op niveau bent voor d match van het jaar
4957671 onze wedstrijd was misschien nog niet super maar we speelden wel met karakter vandaag
4957672 niet veel ploegen zullen kunnen zeggen dat ze met 0 3 zijn komen winnen op het veld van cercle en het is goed voor het vertrouwen iedereen was heel erg ontgoocheld na de europese uitschakeling tegen bate borisov maar we moeten verder en dus moeten we ons volledig concentreren op het belgisch kampioenschap

4957680 the day that all refugees return to their homes and a democratic government elected by the people comes to power
4957681 are we to understand that allowing the original inhabitants of these lands inside and outside palestine whether they are christian muslim or jew to determine their fate runs contrary to principles of democracy human rights and the teachings of prophets

4957683 it is not amazing at all the pick and choose approach of highlighting the misinterpreted remarks of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in october and ignoring this months remarks by irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei that
4957684 our suggestion is very clear let the palestinian people decide their fate in a free and fair referendum and the result whatever it is should be accepted

4957699 i just thank god i was able to perform to the best of my ability so now im just looking forward to the final to give it all i have because i have nothing to lose
4957700 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4957701 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4957702 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4957703 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4957704 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever

4957710 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high

4957719 when i started working for hospice i was surprised to find that our bereavement protocol requires us to call family members the very day after the loss
4957720 its so good to talk to someone who will just listen
4957721 the sheer gaudiness of the olympics and the blatant use of sport for political purposes has devalued the whole circus for me
4957722 je ne sais pas ce que je ressens il y a tellement d motions tellement dexcitation je veux juste voir ma m re

4957729 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
4957730 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
4957731 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
4957732 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
4957733 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
4957734 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
4957735 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4957736 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4957737 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4957738 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4957739 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4957740 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4957741 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4957742 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4957743 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4957744 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4957745 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4957746 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4957747 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4957748 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4957749 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
4957750 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
4957751 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4957752 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws

4957754 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet

4957764 what happened here in the last week certainly came as a shock not only to georgia but to a lot of others as well
4957765 a lot of people will as a result of this want to build a closer relationship with their western partners as quickly as possible
4957766 i would like to believe it will be russia because we are fraternal nations and have to support each other
4957767 russia will not disappear tomorrow as well as in a century or two
4957768 we will always wake up and it will be there not canada
4957769 the assumption of the post 1991 settlement has been that the old russia is in the past that it is not a country that invades its neighbors
4957770 basically the entire european security architecture is based on this premise
4957771 smart russians keep silent and they still think about their fate in ukraine

4957774 ahora aqu no se pueden hacer pel culas independientes que no sean comedias facilonas o de terror sangriento
4957775 s lo rodamos juntos una secuencia pero de inmediato supe que hac a algo inusual y extra o muy especial incluso para el int rprete con m s talento que es encontrar ese punto en el que se sinti completamente libre donde nada de lo que haces puede estar equivocado porque eres la persona que interpretas
4957776 era una escena tensa horrible terror fica y sin embargo a su lado fue una maravilla
4957777 muy diferente a aaron eckhart mi otro amante en la pel cula mucho m s suelto y con quien me pas todo el d a bromeando
4957778 pero no puedo pasarme la vida escondi ndome soy una actriz

4957782 y para abordar un proyecto cinematogr fico como ste tambi n hay que estar un poco loco
4957783 creo que benicio estar de acuerdo con lo que voy a decir
4957784 con su papel del che es de las pocas veces en las que interpreta a un personaje que es todav a m s guapo que l el che parec a m s estrella de cine que benicio
4957785 creo que ayud en parte para que el director y la productora estuvieran un poco menos preocupados
4957786 nuestros ojos libres se abren hoy a nuevos horizontes y son capaces de ver lo que ayer nuestra condici n de esclavos coloniales nos imped a observar que la civilizaci n occidental esconde bajo su vistosa fachada un cuadro de hienas y chacales
4957787 que los cambios en el libreto te llegan m s r pido que cuando no eres productor y que puedes proponer algunas ideas o tomar decisiones que no son posibles si eres s lo actor
4957788 pero en cuanto comenzamos a rodar apart de m todos los problemas relacionados con la producci n y me dediqu exclusivamente a la interpretaci n
4957789 pero principalmente pienso que el tren lleg cuando yo estaba all esperando con mi maleta
4957790 l quiere que todo parezca aut ntico tiene animadversi n a todo lo que huela a falso es un int rprete muy comprometido disfruta con la dificultad
4957791 sab a que era un trabajo muy arriesgado que el precipicio era muy profundo no s lo es la historia de una persona sino la de un pa s la de un continente he sentido un gran peso por realizar una interpretaci n que sea consecuente que est basada en la verdad cuando uno interpreta a un personaje real la disciplina es m s r gida a la hora de tomar decisiones se debe ir mucho m s preparado se tiene que investigar m s tienes que leer todo lo que llegue a tus manos porque no te lo puedes inventar yo trat de no inventarme nada aunque a veces no tuve m s remedio que hacerlo cuando haces un personaje que no est basado en la realidad puedes improvisar con el che no es posible mi trabajo ha sido muy documentado
4957792 he visto muchas im genes pero lo m s importante fue leer lo que l escribi
4957793 el esfuerzo la energ a con la que actu como ser humano ten a una fuerza una determinaci n tan poderosa y tan viva no s lo cre a en sus ideas y las defend a sino que actuaba en consecuencia era una persona que hac a lo que cre a era tremendamente consecuente
4957794 hay muchas personas que pueden compartir sus ideas pero bien pocas dispuestas a arriesgar su vida por ellas
4957795 es un h roe irrepetible jam s volveremos a ver otra revoluci n comparable a la revoluci n cubana
4957796 quer amos saber qui n era este hombre lo que hizo su historia creo que el mito no se lo hizo l mismo sino la gente del pueblo de cuba a la que l ayud incansable a mucha gente olvidada por la miseria y la pobreza l les tendi una mano el revolucionario hace la revoluci n pero tambi n la revoluci n crea al revolucionario sin la gente l nunca habr a sido el che
4957797 es dif cil juzgarlo no puedo yo sentarme aqu en madrid y juzgar a una persona que de verdad se sacrific por la gente y sus ideales no puedo criticarlo quiz podr a en una barra de bar con dos whiskys pero no en una entrevista de todas maneras s podr a decir porque ya lo han dicho otros antes que yo que era una persona que actuaba con demasiada precipitaci n pod a haber tenido algo m s de paciencia a veces a lo mejor estar a vivo ahora si hubiera tenido m s paciencia
4957798 no era reflexivo pero precipitado hay que ver tambi n al che como un producto de los a os sesenta en los que el mundo iba muy r pido y ah estaba l el mundo cambi gracias a lo que hicieron todos esos personajes en los a os sesenta
4957799 eso es una conversaci n distinta creo que no se puede hablar s lo de la dictadura de fidel castro sin a adir el embargo al que tiene sometido estados unidos al pueblo cubano es una peque a isla ahogada sin motivo nunca invadi estados unidos nunca ha realizado actos de terrorismo nunca ha declarado la guerra al gobierno norteamericano el che tendr a su propia opini n y yo no soy la persona adecuada para decir lo que pensar a
4957800 desde chico le prohibieron hacer muchas cosas a causa del asma prohibir algo a alguien en edad adolescente es como incitarle a hacerlo desde siempre se mostr como una persona obsesionada por saltarse todos los obst culos que le pon an

4957802 desde la propia escritura de los guiones ten amos tant simo material que era muy complicado condensarlo y hacer un gui n tardamos muchos a os en intentar meter todo ese material en una sola pel cula hasta que habiendo fracasado en el intento llegamos a la conclusi n de que hac a falta hacer dos pel culas sa fue tambi n una decisi n cargada de pol mica dentro de la producci n porque ya se hab an hecho acuerdos de distribuci n con empresas de todo el mundo para una sola pel cula la financiaci n tambi n fue un problema tremendo yo he hecho pel culas muy caras y tambi n de bajo presupuesto pero jam s he tenido tanta presi n a nivel financiero como con esta pel cula siempre parec a que faltaba dinero
4957803 l sab a que hab amos hecho un estudio sobre el che que nos hab amos reunido con mucha gente que le conoci pero no s si ha llegado a leer el gui n
4957804 esto es una pel cula se han escrito libros se han hecho canciones camisetas fotos y m s pel culas dice sta no es la primera y tampoco ser la ltima es otra m s el che hizo su vida steven y yo la nuestra nos conocemos hacemos traffic estamos en hollywood pensamos en el che nos dan unos visados para viajar a cuba hacemos un estudio como cineastas nos implicamos en el proyecto en busca de algo original basado en la verdad y ya est eso s quien lo origin todo fue el che

4957826 the things that pop music was there to do for us have all been done theres nothing to rail against now
4957827 when i was 15 in the north west of england the record cover to me was like a picture window to another world seeing an andy warhol illustration on a velvet underground album was a revelation it was the art of your generation true pop art
4957828 with downloads and everything its just killing the whole art side of music stone dead to be quite honest unless you have 20 20 vision its very hard to read anything written on a cd cover there was something very special about vinyl albums its a great shame
4957829 iconic sleeves can help to sell significant amounts of records
4957830 if a band has put effort into the music why not devote that same meticulousness to the package
4957831 you are creating a sleeve that you want to be as iconic as possible its got to work when its a thumbnail on amazon its got to work on the shelves at tesco and on the racks at hmv
4957832 with bands being able to sell music online it frees designers from the constraints of retailers
4957833 but now what is fantastic is that we see bands selling music online where they can sell either a digital download or offer the option to buy a special packaging version of the product that can be mailed to them that can be any shape any size and any format

4957838 ensure that the conveyancing and valuation processes capture the true value of the property
4957839 we will see lenders be more cautious with their lending so it will make the process all the more drawn out and complicated in terms of valuing the property and how they decide whether to lend
4957840 that will mean in today s climate that they will be more cautious about lending it s just another thing making it harder for borrowers to get a loan

4957855 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
4957856 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
4957857 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen

4957860 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
4957861 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
4957862 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4957863 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4957864 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
4957865 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
4957866 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
4957867 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through
4957868 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and issues have to be taken on their merits
4957869 i cant in good conscience support a law that i just dont agree with
4957870 im just really relieved to get back safe and sound after the ordeal up there

4957880 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4957881 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4957882 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4957883 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4957884 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
4957885 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush

4957906 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4957907 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4957908 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4957909 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime

4957919 the savage wars of peace small wars and the rise of american power
4957920 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
4957921 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
4957922 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million

4957925 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4957926 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4957927 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4957928 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4957929 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4957930 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4957931 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4957932 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4957933 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4957934 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4957935 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4957936 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4957937 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4957938 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4957939 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4957940 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly

4957947 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4957948 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4957949 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4957950 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4957951 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4957952 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4957953 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4957954 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4957955 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4957956 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4957957 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4957958 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4957959 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4957960 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4957961 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4957962 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4957963 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4957964 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4957965 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4957966 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4957967 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4957968 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4957969 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4957970 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream

4957974 maybe the olympics wont happen for me but i can do it in 2012 if my body holds together i guess that is what i need now a bit of luck
4957975 the amount of running ive done coming in wasnt enough
4957976 but i didnt do all that work for nothing its just really frustrating
4957977 i knew i was pushing it coming in with three and a half weeks of running you cant take shortcuts in the marathon and i guess i learned that today
4957978 fingers crossed for 2012 look at constantina how old is she 38 maybe i can do that i know in london i will have all that support
4957979 i would have walked because it was something that was actually ok walking i havent made the injury worse
4957980 if i felt i was doing some serious damage i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the olympic games so many people have worked so hard to get me here
4957981 i wanted to finish it was really frustrating because i felt really comfortable i could talk and tell husband gary what was wrong
4957982 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4957983 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4957984 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4957985 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4957986 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4957987 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4957988 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4957989 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4957990 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4957991 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4957992 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4957993 il ny a aucun signe que les russes planifient leur retrait au contraire ils multiplient leurs points de contr le et fortifient leurs positions

4958000 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4958001 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4958002 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4958003 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4958004 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4958005 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4958006 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4958007 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4958008 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4958009 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

4958036 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4958037 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4958038 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4958039 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4958070 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4958071 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4958072 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view

4958078 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4958079 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4958080 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4958081 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4958082 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4958083 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4958084 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4958085 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

4958087 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4958088 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure

4958090 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time

4958093 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4958094 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4958095 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4958096 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4958097 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4958098 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4958099 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4958100 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway

4958111 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

4958116 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4958117 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4958118 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4958119 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4958120 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4958121 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4958122 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4958123 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4958124 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4958125 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4958126 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4958127 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4958128 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4958129 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4958130 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4958131 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4958132 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4958133 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4958134 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4958135 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4958136 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4958137 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4958138 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4958139 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4958140 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4958141 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4958142 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4958143 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4958144 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4958158 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4958159 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4958160 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4958161 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4958162 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4958163 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4958164 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet

4958191 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year

4958193 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4958194 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4958202 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4958203 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4958204 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11

4958217 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4958218 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4958219 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4958220 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4958221 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

4958225 for the good that i will to do i do not do but the evil i will not to do that i practice
4958226 im not a parent so i dont have any kids who are fans of hers so i probably shouldnt comment
4958227 ser el primer michael phelps no el segundo mark spitz
4958228 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4958229 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4958230 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4958231 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4958232 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4958233 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4958234 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4958235 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4958236 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4958237 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4958238 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4958239 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4958240 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4958241 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4958242 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4958243 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4958244 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4958245 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4958246 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4958247 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4958248 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4958249 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4958250 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4958251 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4958252 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4958253 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4958254 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4958255 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4958256 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4958257 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4958258 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4958259 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4958260 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4958261 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4958262 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4958263 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4958264 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4958265 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4958266 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4958267 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4958268 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4958269 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4958270 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4958271 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4958272 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4958273 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4958274 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4958275 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4958276 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4958277 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4958278 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4958279 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4958280 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4958281 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4958282 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4958283 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4958284 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4958285 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4958286 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4958288 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4958289 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4958290 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4958291 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4958292 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4958293 it would be best if she had just stayed at home instead of dragging our countrys name through the mud
4958294 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country it is so sad the athens games golden girl was caught doping
4958295 i will not back down never we caught 19 including halkia and that is 19 fewer cheats
4958296 we dont want dirty medals and if we cannot have clean medals then we will just play sports for fun
4958297 i do not consider this a defeat this is a victory in our fight against doping
4958298 yesterday the test came out and today she is not here anymore she is out of the village and on her way home
4958299 we will increase our efforts and each athlete caught is a victory for the anti doping system
4958300 but the hoc cannot sanction athletes who get busted it cannot test federations and coaches
4958301 we can suspect a lot of things but without proof we cannot accuse anybody
4958302 i cannot accept that there may be sick minds out there who would sabotage me i will give all nutritional supplements my vitamins for testing
4958303 i dont believe they put something in her drink or vitamins they always have the same excuse
4958304 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4958305 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4958306 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4958307 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4958308 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4958309 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4958310 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4958311 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4958312 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4958313 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4958314 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon

4958333 ethnic banks avoid bad loans as they take decisions based on factors like culture background social status they are able to judge a persons character better than regular american banks who dont know their clients as well

4958341 even the doctors were beaten badly they security forces opened direct fire on the hospital emergency unit
4958342 last night aug 13 crpf personnel even entered a mosque in pulwama and started indiscriminate firing killing many and injuring over 100
4958343 it seems that the central government has given full control and authority to the security forces who are brutal and ruthless with us
4958344 shoot on sight orders are a clear violation of the right to life of international standards of law enforcement
4958345 excesses are being committed by security forces in the name of controlling the highly volatile situation in the state
4958346 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4958347 we were called in with a report that a man had been swarmed by what looked like hornets and appeared to be having a severe allergic reaction
4958348 i was told the man was not in very good condition

4958367 i knew i would probably get some response from the guided bus people because of the work that was being disrupted it was holding things up
4958368 that was my main aim to try and disrupt as much as possible so that somebody would listen
4958369 we completely decry this kind of protest as it can be dangerous to contractors to the public if similar incidents happen again the police will always be called
4958370 all the days events at least the ones were allowed into
4958371 the daily show news scraper 117 stories 73 situation rooms 26 news tickers
4958372 you all the news stories first before its even true
4958373 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4958374 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4958375 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
4958376 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
4958377 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
4958378 to whom do all these ministers report can you dismiss them if they breach its fundamental
4958379 ive talked to him ive tried to put sense to him but he is adamant ive even suggested to him that perhaps its time for him to give up straight in the face

4958386 madonna detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother it showed a side of her that made her very human
4958387 but i think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him

4958395 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
4958396 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared
4958397 just as sept 11 revolutionized our resolve to defeat our enemies so has it brought into focus the opportunities we now have to secure and expand our freedom

4958401 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4958402 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4958403 i think if they take the tough decisions but lead people in the right direction tell them look theres a reason were doing this itll be short term but theres a tax cut youll get away with almost anything
4958404 i think that in brian cowen you have a very good taoiseach in you have potentially a very good minister for finance cowen has been there he knows what a recession looks like i have every confidence that cowen will take the hard decisions that have to be taken this autumn
4958405 brian cowen has inherited problems that are largely the result of a worldwide recession a doubling of oil prices and a global economic downturn thats tough but its how you respond
4958406 i think if they the government told the country the bad news the public would respond very well to it
4958407 die flugbereitschaft ist ein gutes instrument damit regierungsmitglieder in ausnahmef llen wichtige termine erf llen k nnen

4958409 ich f rchte dass wir nicht mit einer schnellen l sung dieses konfliktes rechnen k nnen
4958410 es ist im moment so viel misstrauen und hass zwischen den kriegsparteien dass wir beide zun chst einmal direkt miteinander ins gespr ch bringen m ssen
4958411 man muss nach den j ngsten reaktionen auf beiden seiten verhindern dass es zu weiteren verh rtungen kommt
4958412 dies kann zumindest ein ansatz f r einen konstruktiven dialog sein
4958413 das ist sicher nicht mit diesen methoden zu erreichen die bundeskanzlerin hat medwedjew zu recht an sein eigenes interesse erinnert sein land zu einem verl sslichen akteur der internationalen politik zu machen der die weltordnung friedlich und kooperativ mitgestaltet
4958414 there is absolutely no commitment on the part of the university of california to do anything
4958415 the uc people basically have questions that everyone has how bad is it
4958416 these are legitimate concerns we need to address them one by one and we will
4958417 ive been coming here since 1990 and have no place else to go
4958418 i think we will have a deal before i leave office at the end of the year

4958421 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
4958422 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
4958423 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
4958424 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too

4958427 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4958428 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4958429 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4958430 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4958431 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4958432 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4958433 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4958434 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4958435 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4958436 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4958437 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4958438 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4958439 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4958440 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4958441 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4958442 our love for telling tales reveals the workings of the mind
4958443 the imaginary world of stories may serve as a proving ground for vital social skills
4958444 the first thing id like to do to my mum is just hug her
4958445 ive literally seen her for about 30 seconds this whole time
4958446 one of the things i really want to do is just lay in my own bed for 5 minutes and just relax
4958447 she just said congratulations and then she started crying and i started crying and then my sister started crying we havent really had too much time together
4958448 my mums told me id better make the team because she wants to go to rome so ive got the pressure from the mum
4958449 there are some things i still want to do to raise the bar a bit more in the world of swimming
4958450 i think over the next four years i would like to try new events and see what happens
4958451 bob has said he wants to start fresh and do things he hasnt done before new training methods and stuff like that
4958452 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4958453 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4958454 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4958455 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4958456 she then ran to her parents home where her father and grandmother were sitting in the dining room he followed her to the house and found the parents there he opened fire
4958457 we recovered two rifles two revolvers a 9mm pistol a safe where some of the firearms were kept a laptop and two cd players the firearms were stolen from a certain house in southridge park during a house breaking

4958461 one good thing to come out of the credit crunch is people are remembering the great british seaside
4958462 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4958463 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4958464 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4958465 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4958466 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4958467 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4958468 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4958469 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4958470 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4958471 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4958472 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4958473 the little bit that we all do like coming to shop in a place like this being conscious of the carbon miles has a great influence
4958474 if we are going to be contemporary in our library service delivery we need to put the resources that we have where people want to access them

4958479 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4958480 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4958481 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4958482 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4958483 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4958484 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4958485 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4958486 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4958487 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4958488 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4958489 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4958490 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4958491 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4958492 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4958493 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4958494 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4958495 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4958496 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4958497 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4958501 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4958502 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4958503 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4958504 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4958505 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4958506 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4958507 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4958508 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4958509 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4958520 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4958521 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4958522 on the other hand heres a thought experiment what if we had a truly non lethal non destructive weapon that simply caused the enemy to lay down their arms and surrender would it be unethical for us to use such a weapon or would it be unethical for us to not use such a weapon

4958545 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4958546 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4958547 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4958548 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4958549 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4958550 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4958551 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

4958556 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4958557 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4958558 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4958559 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4958560 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4958580 known as stepwells also called bawdi hindi or baoli hindi are in essence wells in which the water can be reached by descending a set of step
4958581 all forms of the stepwell may be considered to be particular examples of the many types of storage and irrigation tanks that were developed in india mainly to cope with seasonal fluctuations in water availability a basic difference between stepwells on the one hand and tanks and wells on the other was to make it easier for people to reach the ground water and to maintain and manage the well the majority of surviving stepwells originally also served a leisure purpose as well as providing water this was because the base of the well provided relief from daytime heat and more such relief could be obtained if the well was covered this led to the building of some significant ornamental and architectural features often associated with dwellings and in urban areas it also ensured their survival as monuments stepwell construction is known to have gone on from at least 600 ad most existing stepwells date from the last 800 years there are suggestions that they may have originated much earlier and there are some suggestions that precursors to them can be seen in the indus valley civilisation

4958587 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4958588 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4958589 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4958590 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4958591 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4958592 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4958593 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4958594 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4958595 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4958596 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4958597 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4958598 who are open to doing something on the production side
4958599 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4958600 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4958601 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4958602 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4958603 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4958604 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4958605 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4958606 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4958607 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4958608 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4958609 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4958610 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4958611 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4958612 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4958613 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4958614 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4958615 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4958616 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4958617 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4958618 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4958619 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4958620 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4958621 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4958622 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4958623 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4958624 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4958625 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4958626 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4958627 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4958628 im just really relieved to get back safe and sound after the ordeal up there
4958629 and im just glad its all over and im looking forward to sleeping in a bed tonight
4958630 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4958631 a seq ncia de acontecimentos infelizes em torno dos principais envolvidos nessa hist ria a maldi o que parece cercar o filme come ou com a morte de

4958636 this is the stark truth i only wish the nationalists would put in half as much effort into fighting for local services as they do in attacking labour
4958637 a very nice party with many people i had never met before it was to celebrate the opening of our new opera house everyone was decked out in their most resplendent gala clothes my tuxedo which doesnt see very much use these days came out of the closet was pressed and remarkably still fit me well after all of the speeches and toasts people began to wander the halls admiring the new building i did the same sipping my champagne chatting briefly on occasion with the few people i knew there as well as a few that i didnt
4958638 at one point in the night i found myself alone in one of the private boxes along the east wing of the theatre the view from there was quite beautiful and i paused to steal a moment of quiet appreciation just as i was about to turn and leave the velvet curtains behind me rustled and a young woman entered she was not particularly pretty i must say her eyebrows were dark and she had a serious look about her almost in contrast her dress was made of a gorgeous golden fabric with a tight fitting bodice from which her rather broad shoulders emerged we smiled at one another and exchanged pleasantries nothing extraordinary i left the booth and walked back down to the lobby for another glass of champagne something however nagged at me about the whole exchange although there was nothing that i could put my finger on directly there was almost a rudeness about her although when i played our meeting through in my mind there was no evidence of anything like that she had been perfectly polite she had smiled she had even made a witty comment everything went as it usually does when one encounters a young woman at these sorts of events then just as i had secured a fresh flute of champagne it hit me
4958639 she hadnt noticed my eye at all its usually the young women who react the most to my particular deformity
4958640 but this woman had been completely oblivious and for some reason that i cant explain the fact really irked me
4958641 so i carefully sought her out again slowly roaming the rooms looking for another opportunity to speak with her one came eventually and once again i struck up a conversation with her i was intent on continuing our dialogue until the point when she noticed my eye
4958642 but the moment never came we must have talked for almost 10 minutes to the point where the conversation became a little strained but still there was no reaction from this woman no indication that she recognized my glass eye at all
4958643 i left that evening feeling strangely perturbed and still two days later it bothers me
4958644 2 haltes geleden wel 2 mensen naar de bus stonden te schreeuwen
4958645 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4958646 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4958647 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4958648 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4958649 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4958650 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4958651 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4958652 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4958653 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4958654 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4958655 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4958656 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4958657 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4958658 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4958659 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4958660 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4958661 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4958662 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4958663 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4958664 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4958665 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4958666 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4958667 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4958668 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4958669 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4958670 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4958671 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4958672 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4958678 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4958679 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4958680 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4958681 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4958682 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4958683 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4958684 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4958685 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4958686 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4958687 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4958688 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4958689 he had so much fun riding the rides with us
4958690 i remember laughing as we rode the log ride and screaming as we rode the big dipper for my first roller coaster experience
4958691 unfortunately he died a year later but i will always remember him acting like a big kid that day with us
4958692 oh what fun riding chartered buses from the town square to geauga lake
4958693 the kids would always be on the lookout to see who would be first to see the big dipper ahead
4958694 we told our mothers after the fact and it was then that my mother realized i was getting too big for the kiddie rides
4958695 during the slow times i would visit the fun house with its wooden slides large wavy mirrors and spinning circle
4958696 the big dipper roller coaster the bumper cars the various rides and the games of skill were free with an employees pass
4958697 it was there at geauga lake park that my widowed mother met and married the park security policeman
4958698 after standing in line the two of us flew around the track
4958699 upon disembarking i noted that my boyfriends face was greener than my blouse
4958700 although the rides are gone i will always retain the memories of that day

4958718 there are a lot of county cricketers and ex pros who play there are a lot of experienced cricketers
4958719 one thing that sticks out for me is the hunger and the intensity county cricket can sometimes be the same thing every day here everyone wants to win they have aims
4958720 for me its a very good level and there are things i can learn and take back to england and the county championship with warwickshire
4958721 whoever you are you want to be playing test cricket and to do that you have to be playing for england ill be sitting there wanting to beat them but at the same time thinking in a few years i want to be there

4958734 all i can say about that is hes one of the most amazing actors of our century
4958735 i remember when we were much younger and met on the set of jamon jamon
4958736 thank god we did that movie i was 22 and it was my first big role and it was her first role we were young people who wanted to eat it all up
4958737 is this the best time in my life i have a real passion
4958738 i have a real passion for acting ive had that passion since i was a little girl
4958739 i always say i try to remember every day how privileged i am to have a job i like so much when i got my first movie at age 16 i thought it was my first and last
4958740 im able to get up in the morning and do a job i love and im able to live from it i never forget that feeling i never want to forget that feeling now after 35 movies its very important for me to keep remembering that
4958741 i was worried about the gun scene for the whole shoot
4958742 with woody there are no rehearsals so i thought how am i going to come into a shot with a gun it felt like one of the most difficult things i would ever have to do
4958743 but woody wanted me to be this pathetic girl with a gun
4958744 so the day we shot that gun scene i was completely lost woody is so clever i think he managed to make all of us forget that we were also doing a comedy
4958745 i was so blown away at a screening to hear that people were laughing
4958746 i thought i was doing the most serious and painful drama ever my character lives in a very dark space
4958747 i didnt want to play her like a crazy person
4958748 i wanted to create this reality she lives in i didnt just want to play someone who is mentally disturbed
4958749 i met woody in new york in a very short meeting less than one minute
4958750 but when i left people told me youve been there for such a long time
4958751 i wrote the script specifically for penelope javier and scarlett johansson it was so funny to me that penelope and javier spent hours in makeup every day talking about these characters theyre such brilliant actors that they didnt need to do that at all they could just come out on set and do the role
4958752 i guess there are all kinds of things going on out there
4958753 there are all kinds of people for these three this makes sense she loves her ex husband and he has a girlfriend she cant get along with her ex when theyre alone and she thinks scarlett is the missing ingredient
4958754 its the most natural thing in the world to her to be in this three way relationship and i didnt want to judge
4958755 i was obsessed with that book and have been attached to the project for five years
4958756 i think its a very honest movie in the film shes much younger but becomes the true adult shes in this relationship with this older man and hes much more frightened than her
4958757 im very very excited i trained for 17 years and i am a dancer
4958758 as for the singing well i did audition and i was cast now im taking lessons im very excited about the singing
4958759 some characters like this put you in a space thats exhausting emotionally i dont like doing that on purpose
4958760 i dont think youre only a good actress if youre suffering
4958761 i like the characters that put you in a quiet and peaceful space but this one was not like that i was very exhausted when i was her

4958784 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4958785 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4958786 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4958787 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4958788 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4958789 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4958790 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4958791 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4958792 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4958793 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4958794 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4958795 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4958796 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4958797 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4958828 that is what being an olympic champion is all about putting everything on the line and believing that you will get to the end and that is what i did

4958834 equity release has been the subject of a lot of bad press but almost half of people seeing it as a possibility indicates it is becoming a mainstream option
4958835 however seeking advice and getting a personalised illustration before committing to an equity release product is absolutely essential so its quite concerning to see from the research that so many people dont know where to go for guidance

4958845 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder

4958853 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4958854 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4958855 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4958856 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4958857 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4958858 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds

4958860 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4958861 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

4958873 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4958874 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4958875 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4958876 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4958877 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4958878 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money

4958883 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress

4958895 i have a history of doing these songs where i incorporate the names of labels famous people or animals like i did on animal planet
4958896 this time im speaking about cars but im speaking about them in a whole different fashion i start the song off by saying i took her off the floor no money down im talking about a female but im comparing her to a car im not talking about how much my rims cost my soft leather seats the tvs in the headrest and all these things that really have no value or meaning to me
4958897 i never focus on what people are listening to or what other guys are doing

4958903 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4958904 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4958905 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4958906 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4958907 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4958908 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4958909 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4958910 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4958911 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4958912 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4958913 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4958914 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4958915 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4958916 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4958917 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4958918 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4958919 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4958920 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4958953 europese bedrijven die indruk willen maken op klanten kunnen perfect een priv jet charteren om in de champagnestreek een wijnproeverij te organiseren
4958954 hetzelfde geldt in de verenigde staten voor silicon valley en de wijnstreek van napa valley dergelijke evenementen zijn uiteraard voorbehouden voor bedrijven met grote budgetten maar wijnproeverijen zijn niet langer een exclusiviteit voor de elite veel bedrijven hebben al ervaren dat ze een populaire en veelzijdige manier zijn om nieuwe zaken te doen of het personeel aan zich te binden
4958955 maar dikwijls gaat het ook om een maaltijd in een duur restaurant gekoppeld aan een duurdere bordeaux of bourgogne
4958956 de meest populaire proeverij blijft echter een bezoek van een wijnspecialist met een aantal dozen wijn aan het bedrijf een ander populair format is de wijnquiz met prijzen

4958993 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
4958994 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
4958995 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule

4959009 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people
4959010 is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad

4959058 ottime credo di avere giocato un buon match ma la cosa pi importante che ho la resistenza per fare una gara intera che mi sono sentito bene e che il ginocchio non mi ha dato alcun problema
4959059 sto crescendo la forma migliora e non ho avuto contraccolpi per il ginocchio andr tenuto ancora un po sotto controllo certo che il peggio alle spalle

4959066 ma io mi adatto a tutto vero che in italia non ho mai giocato cos ma nellajax questo schema era il mio pane quotidiano con giocatori simili a figo e mancini ai lati senza dimenticare che il fatto di poter interpretare pi moduli sar un grosso vantaggio durante la stagione
4959067 intanto ho lavorato duro non solo per essere pronto sin dalla prima gara ufficiale ma anche per giocare ai miei livelli sino a maggio compreso allora che ci si gioca scudetto e soprattutto champions league guardate cristiano ronaldo ha vinto premier e coppa mantenendo un livello altissimo per diversi mesi una stagione lunga e faticosa ma io non voglio pi perdermi nulla

4959093 it used to be that photographs provided documentary evidence and there was something sacrosanct about that
4959094 is fulfilling the wish that all of us have to make reality to our liking
4959095 this faked photograph actually created the assumption people kind of remember him as there
4959096 thats the nature of the photograph its a western sense of reality that what is in front of the lens has to be true

4959108 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4959109 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4959110 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4959111 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence

4959153 i think they know me what i ask of them about my style the movement around the pitch they know and its better now
4959154 the first and second games were different teams and it was hard enough i think they know better because at the end of the season we had 10 days together
4959155 our focus is on the premier league and we know how important it is to win the premier league for the fans
4959156 it has been too many years and we are focusing on that it was important to start with a win after the not so very good game in the champions league
4959157 i always want to play with a good player like robbie and he is fine for me and the team which is more important
4959158 ich bin froh dass sich die harte arbeit im training und mit dem mentaltrainer ausgezahlt hat der kopf war entscheidend damit h tte ich nicht gerechnet hier noch einmal zu gewinnen ist phantastisch

4959160 aint no doubt about that were going to fight for this thing but weve got to play better than weve played the last three weeks theyre a better ballclub than this and they all know it
4959161 i still think that we have a club that can be in the playoffs but obviously we have a lot of work
4959162 we have to win a lot of games and we have to play flawless baseball
4959163 weve had a number of mistakes where weve had guys running into outs guys making mistakes on defense not getting the job done on offense not moving runners not getting bunts down getting doubled up on the base paths
4959164 its the same guys the same formula the same hitting coach
4959165 nothings really changed other than weve brought it up a whole lot i think my attitude is going to be you know what just go up there and compete and have a good at bat
4959166 sometimes you worry about all that other stuff but well what do you think about when theres no one on base simply competing seeing the ball and hitting it you start to bring too much into the equation
4959167 we have a group of guys that know how to plate a run
4959168 the history is there they know how to hit when it counts unfortunately theres a fluctuation that can occur and we are dealing with a low spike in that i guarantee if you ran the same hitters out there another year you would have a different result our guys are pressing im sure
4959169 it seemed like he was having a pretty easy time with us

4959183 a number of people who thought the exhibit wasnt appropriate
4959184 we came to realize that parts of the exhibition were not in keeping with our mission as a jewish organization and did not belong at spertus this exhibition caused pain for members of our key audience who felt it presented anti israel points of view
4959185 spertus is not interested in going around and hurting peoples feelings
4959186 committed to asking the hard nosed questions about a lot of things
4959187 it is unfortunate when donors wield more influence over museum exhibits than the museums professional staff and that controversial topics cannot be raised because of objections from a local community presenting viewpoints that may be unsettling and challenging are precisely the role that museums should play in our modern society
4959188 these are not fringe palestinian and israeli artists these are mainstream artists who are able to display in their own country why can t this art be seen by american jews it s really a shame
4959189 must pull its punches by cancelling an exhibit most viewers and artists found well within the consensus of political and artistic discourse about the israeli palestinian conflict hasn t lost the right to call itself and art museum

4959292 the role of greenhouse gases is to cool the atmosphere and this with the surface warming from solar radiation generates convective instability
4959293 the ipccs most recent assessment attempts to be helpful to the casual enquirer by having a series of explanations for frequently asked questions or faqs
4959294 the reason the earths surface is this warm is the presence of greenhouse gases which act as a partial blanket for the longwave radiation coming from the earths surface this blanketing is known as the natural greenhouse effect
4959295 much of the thermal radiation emitted by the land and the ocean is absorbed by the atmosphere including clouds and reradiated back to earth this is called the greenhouse effect
4959296 a credible explanation has no need for smoke and mirrors the energy flow through the climate system is predominantly by way of four stages 1 absorption of solar radiation at the surface 2 conduction of heat and evaporation of latent energy from the surface to the atmospheric boundary layer 3 convective overturning that distributes heat and latent energy through the troposphere and 4 radiation of energy from the atmosphere to space we will see that it is the characteristics of convective overturning that keep the surface warmer than it would otherwise be the kiehl and trenberth 1997 global average energy budget of the earth see figure where the units are w m 2 is used by the ipcc and is a useful starting point for explanation of the establishment and maintenance of the greenhouse effect of the 340 units of solar radiation entering the earths atmosphere 67 are absorbed by the atmosphere and 168 are absorbed at the surface there is thus an ongoing source of solar energy available to the atmosphere and the surface at the surface there is a net accumulation of radiation energy because the incoming solar radiation 168 units exceeds the net loss of longwave radiation 66 units in the atmospheric layer there is absorption of 417 units 390 of emission from the surface less 40 that go directly to space plus absorption of 67 of solar radiation and an emission of 519 units 324 back to the surface and 195 direct emission to space the net effect of the interaction between the greenhouse gases and radiation is a tendency to cool the atmosphere because it is continually losing energy overall there is a dichotomy with radiation processes firstly tending to warm the earths surface and secondly tending to cool the atmosphere air is an excellent insulator against conduction of heat and will not transfer heat through the atmosphere as is necessary for energy balance also the thermodynamic properties of air potential temperature increases with height ensure that turbulent motions of the atmosphere will mix energy downward not upward as required the process for transferring energy from the surface to the atmosphere necessary to achieve overall energy balance of the climate system was explained by herbert riehl and joanne malkus the latter better known as joanne simpson in a 1958 paper on the heat balance of the equatorial trough zone geophysica riehl and malkus noted that boundary layer air rising buoyantly in the protected updraughts of deep tropical convection clouds converts heat and latent energy to potential energy away from the convection compensating subsidence converts potential energy to heat what is implied in the riehl and malkus model is that deep tropical convection and the transfer of energy from the surface to the atmosphere will not take place without buoyant updraughts within deep convection clouds that is there is a need for the temperature of the atmosphere to decrease with altitude and that the rate of decrease of temperature must be sufficient to allow buoyancy of the air ascending in the updraughts from well known thermodynamic laws the rate of decrease of temperature must be at least 6 5oc km to allow the buoyancy forces of convection to overcome the natural stratification of the atmosphere the climate system will come into energy equilibrium when temperatures are such that the net solar radiation absorbed is balanced by the longwave radiation to space at equilibrium the greenhouse effect ie that the average surface temperature of 14oc is greater than the 19oc blackbody emission temperature of earth is an outcome from the need for convective overturning of the atmosphere

4959347 i sure would like to know what would have happened if it hadnt landed
4959348 once that right hand landed it was like i was fighting half blind or pretty much blind at that point it was all pretty much downhill from there
4959349 i just tried to come back and mount some type of offense unfortunately i was never able to mount anything that significant after getting rocked with a shot like that and not being able to see youre more in survival mode
4959350 it doesnt sit very well with me ill be honest i mean you go out there and right at the beginning of the fight get caught with probably the biggest shot ever and youre starting off right away in a negative position
4959351 thats kind of what everybody expected isnt it i mean thats where he comes from hes got the pro wrestling background thats kind of what they do
4959352 if the fans dont like it the fans need to make their opinions heard on it but i expected as much
4959353 if thats how hes going to behave thats how hes going to behave id still like another shot at it but well see how that goes later
4959354 that was for heaths camp because on the way out to the octagon there was some things said before the fight

4959356 they thought i had a small orbital problem but i think thats going to heal up and everything should be okay

4959403 berlusconi nato parallelamente al vecchio regime e non esattamente un uomo delle libert
4959404 un governo con i fascisti perch saremmo mesi al bando in tutta europa
4959405 berlusconi rappresenta quei cinque partiti che hanno rovinato il nostro paese e che attraverso lui si sono riuniti per tentare di resistere ma loperazione per fortuna fallita
4959406 i voti ai fascisti non sono utilizzabili per governare in nessun paese democratico delloccidente
4959407 berlusconi voleva che non parlassimo sperava che non parlassimo il suo un mondo di cartapesta ci sono le tv e quattro tecnici non c organizzazione politica
4959408 se venisse legittimato il porcile fascista tornerebbero i neonazisti in germania e i lepenisti in francia quelli fascisti sono voti che non porteranno mai a governare in nessun paese
4959409 ho gi detto di no per ovvi motivi reputo che un uomo daffari cos importante e cos impegnato come berlusconi si troverebbe in grosse difficolt a fare il presidente del consiglio a trattare tutti i giorni e a doversi confrontare con i propri interessi personali
4959410 qui siamo di fronte ad una situazione di emergenza pericolosa per la democrazia una situazione in cui ha vinto un partito che non esiste cio ha vinto un uomo solo
4959411 siamo davanti a un partito che nasce grazie alle manipolazioni televisive forza italia non ha un idem sentire al suo interno
4959412 il problema di chi controlla le tv per noi si pone al primo posto perch pu incidere direttamente nellequilibrio democratico
4959413 berlusconi il problema perch grazie alle sue tv in grado di manipolare lopinione pubblica
4959414 per questo dico che siamo in una situazione di emergenza e che a rischio la stessa democrazia perch il succo di tutto questo un partito che di fatto un uomo solo in grado di controllare le tv ma chi controlla il controllore
4959415 il sistema stato utilizzato in campagna elettorale e potrebbe essere utilizzato ancora per manipolare la coscienza della gente
4959416 si sa bene che in nessun paese c una situazione di questo tipo

4959428 c da temere per il controllo che berlusconi ha sui mass media il 50 degli spettatori guarda i suoi programmi senza dimenticare linflusso indiretto della pubblicit e quello diretto degli uomini di paglia di berlusconi sulle trasmissioni tv
4959429 la sua fininvest unimpresa che mette in pericolo la democrazia in questo paese si tratta di un monopolio gigantesco di cui non c altro esempio mondiale

4959436 ronni bennett does a great job of demystifying the later years of life
4959437 want to receive short sale amp foreclosure listings via email
4959438 when youre worried about making your payments higher taxes are the last thing you need to worry about
4959439 this is going to make a happy holiday for many homeowners
4959440 the response to the smoke free legislation has been encouraging
4959441 all of the information that you glean through research through polling through focus group testing that informs your policy you are going out talking to the electorate about their wants and needs and using that to inform policy
4959442 election campaigns have now become all about organisation and discipline and control and style theres a very clear script written in advance and all the main players stick to it with some rigor
4959443 there is no doubt we are behind schedule right now
4959444 there is no clear planning and things are moving at snails pace
4959445 the sheer magnitude of planning involved in the olympics is mind boggling and we would draw inspiration from the best practices followed here
4959446 kneeling was my weakest position and i had told earlier also that if i do well in this position you would see me in the final
4959447 the steps are only about two feet wide and you spiral your way down a bell tower to get out

4959452 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4959453 france hasnt any oil but she knew how to exploit a rich idea in the whirlwind of globalization civil nuclear power became a weapon commercial and political that allowed the country to remain at the avant garde in the concert of nations
4959454 thus the covenant that god made with the jewish people through moses remains eternally valid for them
4959455 to the jewish people whom god first chose to hear his word belong the sonship the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and of their race according to the flesh is the christ
4959456 catholics understand that all previous covenants that god made with the jewish people have been fulfilled in jesus christ through the new covenant established through his sacrificial death on the cross
4959457 might be understood to imply that one of the former covenants imparts salvation without the mediation of christ whom christians believe to be the universal savior of all people
4959458 the catechism is not the place where you work out difficult theological problems
4959459 are in a real relationship with god based on a covenant that has never been revoked
4959460 all covenants with israel find fulfillment in christ who is the savior of all
4959461 it is also the churchs understanding that the full incorporation of israel
4959462 the next printing will not occur until the remaining volumes from the latest printing are exhausted
4959463 anche a nome degli oltre 5 000 operatori della polizia ferroviaria che ogni giorno sono in servizio sui treni e nelle stazioni per garantire la sicurezza ai cittadini che viaggiano esprimiamo solidariet piena al macchinista e rls dante de angelis che ha denunciato i problemi legati alla rottura degli eurostar e alla manutenzione i problemi legati alla sicurezza dei convogli e alla manutenzione sono noti anche agli operatori della polizia di stato che i treni li frequentano per servizio e del resto alcune inchieste portate avanti da autorevoli giornali confermano che problemi esistono anche la magistratura a quel che ci risulta sta indagando su alcuni recenti incidenti
4959464 they police are claiming that by examining the victims he acted as a private doctor
4959465 the report that we released was a report by the government of kenya and is protected by law
4959466 those are the charges he will be facing in court

4959468 baby and me behind bars number of moms in prison grows
4959469 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4959470 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4959471 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4959472 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4959473 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4959474 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4959475 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4959476 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4959477 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4959478 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4959479 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4959480 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4959481 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4959482 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4959483 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4959484 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4959485 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4959486 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4959487 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4959488 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4959489 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4959490 this is a planning took where all things are going
4959491 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4959492 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4959493 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4959494 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4959495 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4959496 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4959497 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4959498 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4959499 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4959500 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4959501 2 look at pictures of people who look like that person if you can find them nudes are good were a resource look a lot if the pictures bother you in some way turn away and then turn back and keep looking if you are a porn reader or watcher porn is good here
4959502 i thought weve taken mid stream adjustments to a whole new level
4959503 a small tear forms as you see albany in the rearview mirror going down 87 doing the speed limit
4959504 you answer a lot of questions in the preseason games
4959505 yesterday as the kids today indicate i personally dont want to hear anything more of or about him
4959506 we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed
4959507 the oic has become an indispensable player at the international level in many domains
4959508 defending the image of islam and combating the phenomenon of islamophobia
4959509 at the top of our priorities and preoccupations while conducting a large scale worldwide effort to confront it
4959510 the un human rights council in geneva and the un general assembly
4959511 muslim countries have won a battle to prevent islam from being criticized during debates by the un human rights council
4959512 this council is not prepared to discuss religious matters in depth consequently we should not do it
4959513 while costeas ban applies to all religions it was prompted by muslim countries complaining about references to islam
4959514 the united nations general assembly adopted similar resolutions against the defamation of islam
4959515 with the aim of playing a more active role in engaging american policy makers
4959516 and in confronting the danish cartoons and the dutch film fitna
4959517 we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed
4959518 as we speak the official west and its public opinion are all now well aware of the sensitivities of these issues they have also started to look seriously into the question of freedom of expression from the perspective of its inherent responsibility which should not be overlooked
4959519 truth is no defence before a human rights tribunal steyns accuracy is not at issue just his opinions under hate legislation opinions are punishable if they offend a particular group if you think about it this is an abomination
4959520 if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it this finds favor with god for you have been called for this purpose since christ also suffered for you leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps
4959521 my imprisonment in the cause of christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else and that most of the brethren trusting in the lord because of my imprisonment have far more courage to speak the word of god without fear
4959522 to you it has been granted for christs sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake
4959523 kita harus hati hati karena kita tidak tahu seberapa jauh dampak dan lamanya resesi global ini saya pun tidak yakin kontrak pembelian masih berlanjut di tengah resesi saat ini
4959524 saya pikir hal itu harus diperhitungkan kembali secara mendalam sampai pertengahan tahun ini saat ini saya tidak bisa menduga karena masih ada yang membeli terutama kontrak dengan as kita lihat apakah setelah kontrak selesai mereka masih membeli
4959525 saat ini penjualan mobil memang terus meningkat karena daya beli masyarakat menengah ke atas belum terpengaruh krisis global tapi orang yang membeli sepeda motor akan berkurang karena kemungkinan pendapatan menyusut dan tidak banyak pekerjaan saat ini
4959526 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4959527 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4959528 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4959529 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4959530 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4959531 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4959532 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4959533 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4959534 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4959535 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4959536 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4959537 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4959538 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4959539 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4959540 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4959541 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4959542 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4959543 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4959544 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4959545 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4959546 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4959547 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4959548 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4959549 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4959550 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4959551 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4959552 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4959553 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4959554 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4959555 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4959556 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4959557 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4959558 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4959559 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4959560 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4959561 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4959562 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4959563 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4959564 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4959565 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4959566 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4959567 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4959568 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4959569 akan ada dampak lebih hebat terhadap asia tenggara karena mereka menghadapi persaingan langsung dengan china dalam hal jumlah produk ekspor

4959592 when an artist signs on to the store they allocate a certain portion of the revenue generated by their songs to go back to their fans this money is then distributed according to how early each user purchased a song the earlier you buy the more you make for example the band my first earthquake has decided to pay out 30 of its revenues to its fans the earliest adopters say the first dozen people to buy the song will break even after the song has been purchased by around 25 other people fans buying the song later on will still earn credit but it will be earned at a much slower rate the site will tell you how quickly youll be earning credit before you buy a song

4959600 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4959601 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4959602 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4959603 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4959604 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4959605 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4959606 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4959607 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4959608 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4959609 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4959610 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4959611 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4959612 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4959613 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4959614 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4959615 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4959616 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4959617 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4959618 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4959619 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4959620 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4959621 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4959622 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4959623 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4959624 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4959625 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4959626 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4959627 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4959628 to have received a house for 30 to 50 a week i think compromises you and mr thomas should have known better
4959629 i think he mr barnett should get rid of steve
4959630 where in that do i say they should get any special treatment
4959631 the labor party has said lets try and drag this down into the gutter and thats where theyre at their best i refuse to descend to their level
4959632 ill be on the side of the children who are offended against and their families
4959633 i can think of no more heinous crime than pedophilia and the abuse of children

4959693 wir aus der energiewirtschaft erleben stellvertretend f r viele andere branchen ein klima der handlungsangst alles was wir vorhaben was wir planen was wir versuchen wollen wird mit deutschem perfektionsdrang blockiert nicht von gesetzen sondern von den herzen der menschen es herrscht ein emotionaler konsens in dieser gesellschaft dass jegliches handeln meiner branche teufelswerk ist der protest ist eine boomende gesellschaftliche ausdrucksform ein happening das ber alle schichten und klassen hinweg gemeinsamkeit stiftet das ist sch n aber es erleichtert das f hren von unternehmen nicht schon gar nicht im energie sektor morgen kann es eine andere branche betreffen am ende bleibt unternehmerisches handeln ist praktisch unm glich
4959694 es gab zeiten in meinem leben da habe ich tats chlich an ideale wie die freiheit des unternehmers geglaubt seitdem es zu meinen aufgaben geh rt langfristig energie zu erzeugen bin ich recht ern chtert denn freiheit gilt wenig oder nichts vielmehr halten wir fest am ist zustand am standard das ist der zentrale begriff unserer tage standard der standard scheint alle risiken auszuschlie en er gibt sicherheit standards m ssen sie als unternehmer als politiker als professor unbedingt halten aber er darf praktisch nichts kosten

4959745 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do

4959760 my point isnt that either group is right or wrong and i find both types of blogs to be entertaining and i read all of them daily or as often as they post
4959761 then there are the blogs that focus on the cuteness and rear ends of the minnesota nine
4959762 they tend to use statistics and other some times conventional wisdom to discuss the current issues the ball club is facing
4959763 it seems that daymonsters post was an overreaction to something that seemed to be rather innocuous at the time and then this all snowballed

4959831 to hold any team to six points in the nfl seems to be pretty darn good
4959832 i dont know much but i know that its the san diego chargers and thats a great accomplishment for us
4959833 tennessees a good football team but we just didnt play well
4959834 to come out and play successful d like that against a very good team its a great feeling especially at home
4959835 keeping the points down as a unit throughout the game
4959836 thats one of our goals to hold teams to field goals once they get in the red zone
4959837 that would just be a disaster a complete and total disaster
4959838 i dont think well get another franchise if they move

4959842 quite a big improvement if they can stay healthy 8 8 something like that

4959855 as india celebrated its 62nd independence day the government has realised that it does not have promises to make but rather promises to keep and this is the long term guarantee made by prime minister manmohan singh to the citizens
4959856 it is an apt solution indias strength lies not in making short term gains but in its resilience to survive the long and tough road ahead
4959857 the government has its work cut out and the prime minister true to character has not flinched against the odds of bringing the economy which is still registering a growth rate but combating climbing inflation back on track
4959858 but the indian people are nothing if not strong willed
4959859 it is this resolve coupled with ambition that has seen the country rise to become a major international force in diverse fields india is both robust and diverse and this is the key ingredient for its success
