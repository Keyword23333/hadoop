4850012 esta cumbre nos permite la posibilidad de ayudar a los partidos de zimbabue a finalizar sus negociaciones para que juntos puedan trabajar para lograr sanar heridas y la reconciliaci n
4850013 estoy seguro de que los millones de zimbabuenses tanto fuera como dentro del pa s esperan con grandes expectativas y altas esperanzas un resultado positivo de nuestras deliberaciones
4850014 i think there is a bit of a shock here at how strong we are
4850015 everybody kept asking can they move up another gear have not they peaked too soon now we showed that we could move on and that is a bit of a shock to the other teams i think

4850017 our understanding is that the agreement has been signed and russian troops are starting to withdraw but there are a lot of units scattered around this area

4850019 he can be called the best olympian of all time

4850030 hey john this would be a great addition to data services and silverlight 2 book when i discuss rest services problem is that i already talk about other rest services like amazon so i need to make sure i do not get carried away with the services and instead i focus on how to interact with them
4850031 were living in a time when politicians are at their most apathetic you just have to look at the last leadership battles in two of the biggest partys both have been uncontested brian cowen took the reigns at fianna fail unchallenged as did eamon gilmore with the labour party
4850032 look at the pds theyre the best example nobody wanted the bloody job irish politicians dont care anymore nobody turns up to the d il if they can help it
4850033 most give terrible excuses for instance last week aengus snodaigh told his party leader that he couldnt attend the d il because he had to get his back amputated however he was the very next day with his back intact running around his front garden with a small dog its getting ridiculous

4850040 se trata verdaderamente de un milagro divino la madre no hab a tomado alg n tratamiento de fertilidad
4850041 but especially in the second half i thought our tactical kicking really stepped up and we just kept making them come out of their own 22 which is tough
4850042 theres a big improvement there and its become a big part of our game and one of the reasons that got us home in the end
4850043 weve been working on guys looking for space and communicating it the champion that dan is you cant rely on him to make all the calls and i think hes now got some good help around him
4850044 they showed tremendous courage and i think thats what won the game
4850045 their courage and their fitness in the last 20 minutes as a coach you feel very proud they had that togetherness
4850046 defence really set the attitude for us and when you make gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get turnovers at the breakdown
4850047 with 15 to go you could feel we were getting on top of them
4850048 we were playing the right part of the field and putting them under pressure in their own half so you could feel the momentum swing our way
4850049 porque mandamos y vamos a seguir mandando y nosotros somos los que mandamos
4850050 they who has once been very foolish will at no other time be very wise 57
4850051 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4850052 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4850053 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
4850054 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
4850055 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
4850056 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
4850057 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4850058 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4850059 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4850060 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4850061 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4850062 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4850063 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4850064 astonished tourists of the piece of the world that is closest to them so they never again take for granted the head that looks at them from the mirror
4850065 man is the only animal that blushes or needs to
4850066 we blush with embarrassment with shyness with uncertainty with a sense of exposure
4850067 blushing is a kind of glass bottomed boat enabling us to look at the depths upon which our ordinary moments float
4850068 there can be few experiences so all consuming as vomiting
4850069 a shouted reminder that we are embodied in an organism that has its own agenda
4850070 50 of people will yawn within five minutes of seeing someone else yawn
4850071 harrumphs are particularly associated with the idea of a member of the establishment whose overweight body provides the perfect instrument for manufacturing it
4850072 one small bite transforms the humble environment of the school into a blissfull world of ruby red juice gushing from every corner like sweet goodness
4850073 we believe its the wrong message to send to elementary students
4850074 our station is one that promotes traditional family values it concerns us when a school district strikes at the heart and core of the biblical values to promote this to elementary school students is a great error
4850075 our purpose was to have a wacky week mixing in a bit of silliness with our reading writing and arithmetic
4850076 its different every year they basically present the ideas and they vote on what they would like from monday through friday
4850077 they did not mean anything by this day they were trying to have fun and come up with a fun dress up day
4850078 i can assure you we will not be having this day again
4850079 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4850080 when life hands you a lemon dont make lemonade spit it out
4850081 the raid for the moment is over if renewed it will not be renewed immediately if the fenians were man activated by ordinary reason it would never be renewed but they are not
4850082 two days before the south ossetians had started using russian positions to shoot at our troops but we decided to make the trip anyway because a direct meeting would have been a breakthrough
4850083 i called and spoke to popov and he said he could not get to the office because his car had a flat tyre
4850084 this was preposterous i said the delegation must have more cars he said there is another car but its tyre is flat too at this point i knew it was a trap and i was very angry
4850085 he said he could not control the south ossetians while there was georgian military on the boundary he said we must declare a unilateral ceasefire before the russians could push them back
4850086 this was a heavy armoured russian column moving slowly on very rugged terrain
4850087 think about how many hours of preparation assembly then marching it would take for that column moving at that speed on rugged terrain to be at the kurta bridge at six in the morning if that isnt a premeditated invasion i dont know what is
4850088 the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
4850089 they had to stay in the hospital because they were so small
4850090 by accepting the missile defence battery poland is exposing itself to a strike such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4850091 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4850092 thats why hes the he never lost his soul in chicago
4850093 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4850094 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4850095 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4850096 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4850097 absolute madness the people who decide these matters should stand up and be counted
4850098 has a responsibility to support those who fight for their country
4850099 the key difference between these two is that the first is a fault case and the second is a no fault case
4850100 the standard of proof to secure a claim is pretty high
4850101 there are far fewer silly cases than people think because bringing one is time consuming and its not worth the risk if lawyers know they wont get paid if they lose where awards seem high there is usually a good reason like the person was a high earner
4850102 unlike personal injury cases where payouts are covered by insurance the cica and the mod are of course funded by the taxpayer taxpayers might complain about the odd iffy award but something tells me they will probably be less keen to dip into their pockets to pay more tax so that more people can get more compensation
4850103 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
4850104 im pushing others in the industry to adopt these technologies because when they do it becomes easier for our company to do business
4850105 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4850106 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
4850107 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
4850108 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
4850109 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
4850110 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4850111 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
4850112 robert scheidt is the sailor i respect most in the world and i look back on those five or six years when we pushed each other to such a high level as the making of my olympic career
4850113 robert is about four years older than me and when i first came into lasers in 1994 he was winning everything
4850114 i modelled myself on him looked at the way he sailed and put his campaign together how he held himself on and off the water the way he sailed the boat was so active and aggressive maximising the equipment surfing the waves he brought a whole new technique to it people used to just go downwind and point at the next mark he started sailing different angles acute angles using the waves he was so fast nobody could touch him i set myself the task of learning his techniques and getting to his level
4850115 it sounds stupid now but i was wondering whether i would ever get another chance to win a gold medal
4850116 there were a few recalls before that final race then they put up the black flag which means anybody over the line in the next start will be disqualified robert was pretty cunning because he was sitting near the committee boat and must have heard them call out his sail number that he was over the line so he just sheeted in and started over the line with 10 seconds to go knowing he was over it when one goes others go because they dont want to be given the jump so about 20 boats went i was among them and we all got disqualified and the net result was that robert won the gold and i got the silver yes in its way it was brilliant
4850117 there were a couple of abandoned starts which gave the game away to robert what i was going to do
4850118 he was prepared for it and it was difficult to get hold of him i just managed to do so in the last five seconds before the start which was perfect because he had a penalty and the rest of the fleet went off while he had to do his penalty turn and i waited for him
4850119 it was very aggressive with plenty being said between the boats
4850120 on the last leg to the finish i was just behind him
4850121 that was the most intense thing ive ever done its in those moments when i feel most alive thats why you do it why we compete for the heat of battle when everything else goes out of your mind
4850122 sou uma pessoa boa de lidar mas problem tica no meu mundo desde que me conhe o sou honesto mas o meu sintoma e a vida s o desonestos comigo
4850123 it really is a desperate situation when we have got parts of the country where the average five year old has lost three teeth we cannot afford to let this get worse
4850124 under this government there has been no effort to promote oral hygiene beyond what the toothpaste companies have done
4850125 the worst thing is these figures dont even show the damage caused by the new contract my fear is that we are looking at a catastrophe within a decade
4850126 in a room full of victims murderers look like gods
4850127 you dont mind if your top player is in control its when your mediocre player is in control
4850128 im not talking about any player in particular im just talking about the state of the game in general a contracts a contract therefore it should be worth something
4850129 in my day the players had no power whatsoever and you always felt you were hard done by and that no one was there to support you in our day we yearned for a halfway house but now it has gone miles in the other direction
4850130 maybe im not being realistic but i dont believe it should be an impossibility players are driven into this idea that the champions league is the be all and end all of everything
4850131 it isnt really you know its a great competition but it isnt everything
4850132 there wasnt one person at villa myself the chairman especially the fans who would have wanted to see gareth leave and go to liverpool or anywhere else
4850133 but the minute he made it known he wanted to go to liverpool i really couldnt do very much about it and thats where you talk about the powerlessness you feel
4850134 at forest we won the european cup twice and those days were fantastic but it was the league competition the 42 matches we played in that that was everything thats what you lived for every single saturday
4850135 it will be difficult but as a football club were going to have to find some way to be able to do it
4850136 villa have won the european cup and that is what i want to aspire to
4850137 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4850138 spocks beard and frost live at the arches 6th july 2008
4850139 in the 1990s american paleontologist emily buchholtz examined the hips of living relatives of stegosaurus birds and crocodilians and found that they also have an enlarged space in their vertebrae but these animals dont have an extra large ganglion there instead that space is filled with fatty tissue
4850140 ultimately there needs to be recognition in our immigration program that there are people already in the pacific being displaced because of climate change people having to leave small atolls and islands because of sea level rises
4850141 we think there needs to be a special category in our humanitarian program that recognises the displacement caused by climate change
4850142 australia and new zealand need to be putting resources and planning into how the displacement can be coped with and how that resettlement can take place
4850143 of course were concerned about the impact on the economy but we think its worth it
4850144 itll make us more creative we need to learn from the united states and other developed countries about how to build cleaner more creative more high tech industries
4850145 at the central government level there is very clear awareness that china is facing an environmental crisis
4850146 theres an awareness that environmental problems lead to social conflict and thats always a concern for the government here
4850147 walking down the street before you couldnt even see until the end of the block it was so dark and hazy
4850148 of course this is much better whats the point of living here with all that pollution
4850149 i like to think its just about the boy and the man on the road but obviously you can draw conclusions about all sorts of things from reading the book depending on your taste
4850150 its kind of ingrained in all fathers to protect their children
4850151 i wasnt afraid of the bleakness of the book the darkness of the book
4850152 i think the success of the book took a lot of people by surprise
4850153 his work examines our core the two faces of violence that co exist in every savage act brutal strength of purpose holding hands with a desperate and cowering weakness
4850154 at its core is a primal struggle against the utmost extremes of the natural world and a thrilling evocation of human endurance
4850155 it is an unflinching examination of human beings at their worst and at their best by the end of the film it is the childs innate goodness and grace under fire that changes the man showing us that amidst barbarity our humanity can be inextinguishable
4850156 cant it be a really bad tsunami rather than the apocalypse
4850157 thats not only to heighten the threat but also to get variety
4850158 it just builds on the story that we are creating of the revenge of nature
4850159 we will create a post apocalyptic world that is boldly original and present a vision that will captivate and haunt precisely because of its strange echoes of familiarity
4850160 usain bolt was absolutely phenomenal this is a man who was absolutely confident in himself he was at peace with himself he knew what he wanted to do he knew what he was going to do and if you look at how he ran the race he was picture perfect right through
4850161 fue un partido duro ten amos confianza en que bamos a ganar y dar la vuelta pero tenemos que esperar el resultado de ingenieros

4850167 when the only tool you have is a hammer you tend to treat everything as if it were a nail
4850168 if i was going to sleep today to wake up in ten years time id be much happier with google stock under my mattress than apple
4850169 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4850170 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4850171 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4850172 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4850173 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4850174 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4850175 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
4850176 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
4850177 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4850178 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4850179 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4850180 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4850181 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4850182 i dont know of any manufacturer that makes a hdv cam with 3 image sensors

4850185 ich habe unter der woche schon muskul re probleme gehabt durch die belastung des spiels sind die beschwerden wieder aufgetreten und in absprache mit joachim l w haben wir uns daf r entschieden dass ich kein risiko eingehe und das regenerationsprogramm in bremen absolvieren soll
4850186 the starbucks brand is part of the society of the spectacle something beyond which we must begin to see viewpoints by president tom manley
4850187 what the obama campaign has lost sight of i think and what it needs to regain control of is the essential message of his candidacy
4850188 if our bees were to come in touch with the genetically modified maize and the honey was contaminated with it we would not be allowed to sell it
4850189 it is well known that bees live 90 percent of their lives in a perimeter of three kilometres
4850190 but bees can fly up to 10 kilometres without any problem now we are really happy that the city of munich has granted our bees asylum
4850191 until the end of the summer by mid august the maize bloom period is over and the bees can go back home
4850192 but in some regions as in brandenburg around berlin it is almost impossible to flee from gmcs genetically modified crops
4850193 the gmcs are everywhere and bees come in touch with them one place or other
4850194 after some good weeks in spring bees are threatened by famine because later in the year there are almost no more blooming flowers
4850195 you can see that in vast regions especially in the eastern part of the country there is nothing for bees to feed on
4850196 we found abundant traces of clothianidin in the bees bodies
4850197 today it is easier for bees to live in the cities because the recreational green areas and courtyards have exuberant varied vegetation which blossoms over several months from early in the spring to the end of the summer
4850198 in the cities bees have only a couple of hundred metres to fly from a public garden to a balcony to a courtyard to find luscious flowers and mostly free of insecticides
4850199 if the bee disappears from the surface of the earth man would have no more than four years to live
4850200 i was really quite shocked and saddened by what the prince had to say it was really rather ill informed and very negative
4850201 and im saddened that the prince of wales who is in a leadership role and able to solve some of the problems he identifies by bringing scientists technicians and agricultural and climate change experts together instead tried to blame the problems of the planet on a technology he clearly does not understand
4850202 he has a lot of understandable concerns about the way the planet is going but it would be good to see him looking broadly and objectively at how those concerns can be addressed and leading a constructive debate rather than dismiss something out of hand that we need to keep the door open on
4850203 gm is not a silver bullet but it is one of many things we need to look at to produce sustainable crops in the future obviously we have to take cautious rational decisions in developing that technology
4850204 crops at the moment are not going to sustain themselves in this time of unprecedented change we need to have crops which can survive and will have less impact on the environment
4850205 really astute businessmen who would not have anything foisted upon them
4850206 i think it is extremely short sighted to blame gm crops for everything that is going on in the world as far as the environment is concerned
4850207 that whosoever believeth in me shall have forever lasting life
4850208 what a book new and experienced managers at every level will fly with this programmed learning
4850209 i love this book and wish i had read it before stepping into my current leadership role it provides a practical and indispensable road map to success that will help new leaders stack the odds in their favor read it and dont be among the forty percent of leaders who fail in the first eighteen months
4850210 the new leaders 100 day action plan offers a comprehensive architecture with practical tools and techniques for new leaders to follow i believe that leaders who utilize the advice from this book will have demonstrative business and culture building results
4850211 one of the most basic yet comprehensive books ive read regarding the dos and donts of a successful on boarding process a must read for all aspiring business leaders from first time ceos to executives at every level of the organization also a great tool for human resources and talent manage ment executives
4850212 but especially in the second half i thought our tactical kicking really stepped up and we just kept making them come out of their own 22 which is tough
4850213 theres a big improvement there and its become a big part of our game and one of the reasons that got us home in the end
4850214 weve been working on guys looking for space and communicating it the champion that dan is you cant rely on him to make all the calls and i think hes now got some good help around him
4850215 they showed tremendous courage and i think thats what won the game
4850216 their courage and their fitness in the last 20 minutes as a coach you feel very proud they had that togetherness
4850217 defence really set the attitude for us and when you make gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get turnovers at the breakdown
4850218 with 15 to go you could feel we were getting on top of them
4850219 we were playing the right part of the field and putting them under pressure in their own half so you could feel the momentum swing our way
4850220 im really pleased ive had coaches pulling me aside and telling me ive made history
4850221 now at least ive got the silver ive had some issues over the last few weeks the last few weeks havent gone the way i had hoped but now its all about the final
4850222 its really got nothing to do with who it is against

4850225 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us it was pretty risky
4850226 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down so we got prepared to stick through another tough night out there
4850227 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm everything was soaking wet
4850228 it was pretty scary i was trying to lead the way the other day and a big slab fell down beside me i was really shitting myself then because its a long way to the bottom
4850229 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking ohhh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break its been like this for days and days
4850230 every time the chopper goes away and looks somewhere else youre thinking come on come on just see us
4850231 we were fine we could have lasted a few more days without too much trouble except for the boredom
4850232 we heard it fly over the back of the ridge as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility it was such a relief to see it waving back to us
4850233 there were times it was kind of scary i have to say but somehow i knew we were going to be all right
4850234 they did the right thing they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4850235 ive been taking a bunch of pills every night trying to kill myself but its not working i took 45 the last time and i still woke up
4850236 it didnt escalate to the point where we saw bruises and bangs
4850237 thats a scary thing to happen in a small town like this

4850249 sothebys is not in a position to evaluate the merits of new jerseys assertions if we were to make an erroneous determination we could be held liable for damages
4850250 sothebys will not release the property until it receives concurring written instructions from all interested parties or a final non appealable order from a court of competent jurisdiction

4850262 creo que hay diferentes ifes uno el de 1990 otro el de 1994 uno nuevo de ah a 1996 luego a 2003 y otro hasta este fecha
4850263 hay varias etapas en esta instituci n que le han dado un per l diferente con acentos distintos fortalezas y debilidades autonom a capacidad de regular interlocuci n con medios y partidos y capacidad de darle legitimidad a los comicios de acuerdo con principios de certeza legalidad e imparcialidad
4850264 desde el punto de vista del blindaje jur dico hab a quien clamaba en el pasado por dientes que no ten a ahora est n ah eventualmente lo que hay que cuidar es que no se abuse de ellos porque tampoco nos conviene eso
4850265 todos los puntos han sido atendidos por la reforma con soluciones particulares y que en todo caso marcan un cambio radical en el esquema de organizar elecciones ahora lo que viene es la actuaci n de las autoridades sin estridencias y sin excesos
4850266 ha habido una sobrecarga de expectativas y atribuciones pero eso es producto de que se trata de una de las instituciones mejor logradas de la transici n
4850267 no vamos a ver blancos y negros creo que en la perspectiva de 2009 la situaci n del ife va a enfrentar un nuevo reto
4850268 y de c mo se puede recuperar cierta autonom a que est amenazada como se ve con esta gura de contralor a general
4850269 los partidos que van a estar metidos en todo el proceso lo cual esta bien pero hay que tener ciertos espacios de autonom a y decisi n porque el paso siguiente es que quieran tener voto eso ser a ya la reversi n completa
4850270 se lograron equilibrios entre el contralor y el consejo general el primero puede indagar pero no sancionar a los consejeros y estos pueden llegado el momento demandar su destituci n al nal del d a quien resuelve es el rgano que los nombra a los dos el congreso en ese sentido no hay un gran peligro
4850271 creo que la autoridad fue fortalecida pero no el acompa amiento de los partidos en las responsabilidades del instituto ser a la peor lesi n para ste aunque ello no signi ca intervenci n pero no descart que haya tentaciones de que esto ocurra contra la autoridad electoral
4850272 im impressed by him hes going to have time to take it up another notch or two and if he does hes a big league regular he still has a lot to prove but hes got a really good swing a good attack and is athletic enough to get better at third base right now hes not a good third baseman but hes come a long way
4850273 he doesnt have a fast twitch in his arsenal so you have to believe in the bat
4850274 hes looked good here and he does have a chance to be that everyday guy
4850275 he should be in the big leagues right now so they the ms can see if hes a backup or not
4850276 i dont think hes anything more than an average bat but thats enough when you are a defensive catcher
4850277 this is my first look at him this season but in the past i was concerned about two things his range at second base he catches everything he gets to but does he get to enough balls
4850278 forget what i said about range hes more than adequate and his hands are better than half the starting second basemen in the majors i see him as an average bat gap power good contact little above average speed and he laid down two good bunts here in this series he can hit in the 8 or 9 hole for me
4850279 i dont think hes going to have a problem keeping the velocity in the 93 94 range once hes built the proper arm strength and i noticed in tucson that he may not be all that comfortable pitching from the wind up but that will come in time
4850280 he should have been down here all year then he could have gone up in august to test himself against major league hitters hes a no 3 starter i think or somewhere in there if his control gets a full step better maybe a no 2 guy but i would worry that hes not a 210 inning guy maybe not even 200 hes never been that kind of pitcher so well have to wait and see on that
4850281 he swings and misses a load but he has great power to right center field and thats encouraging
4850282 he stays inside the ball really well and is still able to punch balls out of the park to the opposite field and to center he can do that with his bat speed his strikeout totals are about his lack of zone judgment and general discipline hes not going to get overpowered
4850283 he should be here right now showing if he can hit the next best thing to major league level pitching
4850284 its a big step to take bigger than any step in the game except the one that leads to the big paycheck moore can hit hit for power and hes not bad behind the plate hes really strong too and is adequate in most areas already
4850285 given the right time to complete his development here next year hes an above average bat with average glove and an above average throwing arm he has some adjustments to make in his technique and needs to get better laterally on balls in the dirt but hes not bad at all
4850286 he could hit 15 20 home runs 30 doubles something like that he makes enough contact to hit for a decent average too maybe 260 to 270 and he draws enough walks to expect acceptable on base numbers
4850287 the entire route of the btc the only major oil pipeline from the caspian region outside of russias control should now be treated as high risk and turkeys viability as an energy bridge to europe has been thrown into question
4850288 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries there is no definite attempt by russia to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
4850289 could render further foreign investment in any oil and gas transport links that bypass russia too risky
4850290 i didnt sit down thinking oh im looking for some creative thing that no ones ever done before i didnt even realize i was considered a humanitarian

4850299 it is a direct transfer from the original declaration handwritten by timothy matlack and signed by the members of the continental congress
4850300 you can hardly read the original that is on exhibition in the rotunda of the national archives building in washington d c mine is the only transfer made from that original and it nearly destroyed it the william stone printings with signatures of all the signers are from an engraving and the john dunlap printed broadsides of the declaration have the printed names of only john hancock and charles thomson scholars and librarians were not aware of the anastatic process until i brought it to their attention
4850301 until i showed the curators at independence national historical park my copy and told them what i had learned about anastatic printing they thought their anastatic facsimile was a centennial souvenir
4850302 they had it conserved in the 1980s but put it storage where it has remained
4850303 tom has done a tremendous service to the field bringing anastatic printing to our attention
4850304 those who go to see the engrossed copy at the national archives are shocked that it is barely visible its pale brown text on off white parchment is impossible to read
4850305 i certify that this is a correct copy of the original declaration of independence
4850306 a perfect facsimile of the original and an exceedingly appropriate ornament
4850307 this is an original anastatic facsimile of the parchment made in 1823 by order of president monroe when john quincy adams was secretary of state adams in compliance with a resolution of congress of may 26 1824 authorized the distribution of 200 copies to the signers who were then living and their heirs this is one of the copies
4850308 we are not aware of any contemporary account that the declaration of independence left washington between 1814 during the war of 1812 and its travel in 1876 to philadelphia for the centennial exhibition
4850309 process of obtaining transfers or reversed fac similes on metallic surfaces from designs or writing in lithographic ink and from prints and printing in general
4850310 plans of roads bridges elevations termini amp c with magic rapidity which saves months of the time of copiers
4850311 it is only necessary that any plan should be drawn in lithographic ink brought to the anastatic office and in a few moments facsimiles are handed to the artist
4850312 robert p smith agent for the patentees of the new process of anastatic printing has his presses at the sunday school union buildings no 144 chestnut st third story where he is prepared to execute orders with which he may be favored to architects artists draughtsman and conveyances this art recommends itself by the perfection facility and cheapness with which designs and drawings of buildings plans maps sketches and writings are copied and multiplied from a single original on common paper when drawn in ink supplied at the office persons interested are invited to call at the anastatic printing office and inspect specimens of transfers of sketches and writing type plans and pictures
4850313 that it is probable the work in large octavo will be issued in a few weeks after the summers jaunt reaches the hands of the public
4850314 the only article in the present collection not taken from an original is the letter from dr franklin to strahan which is from a former copy all the others have been carefully taken by competent artists from the originals of which they purport to be the fac similes
4850315 revolutionary documents letters and relics of george washington and scarce american maps and other rarities
4850316 the declaration of independence an anastatic copy on parchment from the original
4850317 this we may say letter press copy of the declaration of independence is for all historical purposes more important than the original as to make this they allowed the original document to be placed under a certain process which enabled the projectors of the scheme to take a letter press facsimile on stone from the original that this outrage was perpetrated the original declaration only too plainly shows as it is so faded as to be hardly discernable to the naked eye which was afterwards touched up with the burin and from which they were enabled to take a few impressions on vellum this therefore really portrays more truthfully what the document was than the original itself it measures 2 feet 6 inches by 2 feet 1 inches and is framed with wood from the original timbers of independence hall secured during the alteration of the stairway
4850318 it is the province of anastatic printing to revolutionize the world
4850319 let us take for example a page of this journal we dampen the leaf with a certain acid diluted and then place it between two leaves of blotting paper to absorb superfluous moisture we then place the printed side in contact with a zinc plate that lies on the table the acid in the interspaces between the letters immediately corrodes the zinc but the acid on the letters themselves has no such effect having been neutralized by the ink removing the leaf at the end of five minutes we find a reversed copy in slight relief of the printing on the page in other words we have a stereotype plate from which we can print a vast number of absolute facsimiles of the original printed page which latter has not been at all injured in the process that is to say we can still produce from it or from any impression of the stereotype plate new stereotype plates ad libitum any engraving or any pen and ink drawing any ms can be stereotyped in precisely the same manner
4850320 he must have looked on it as a perfect advertisement a marketing tool for his business venture at a time when the declaration was just beginning to be revered as a holy relic
4850321 smith thought the declaration would bring the anastatic process to the attention of the public it would brand his product it was neither commissioned nor endorsed by the government it was a business endeavor and has a place in printing history and in any collection of printings of the declaration along with the dunlap tyler binns stone and the dozens of other declarations printed in the nineteenth century

4850435 sometimes truth isnt good enough sometimes people deserve more sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded
4850436 you thought we could be decent men at an indecent time but you were wrong the world is cruel and the only morality in a cruel world is chance
4850437 i never really understood why we had to struggle so hard to survive from day to day while our neighbours had all the luxuries
4850438 if i want to be minister i can easily achieve that
4850439 in a revolution we had to weaken the repressive state and any institution or structure that represented the government was a legitimate target

4850447 la melancol a de la tarde me ha ganado el coraz n y se nubla de dudas son esos momentos en que uno se pone a reflexionar y alumbra una tormenta todo es tan tranquillo que el silencio anuncia el ruido de la calma que antecede al hurac n
4850448 de repente no puedo respirar necesito un poco de libertad que te alejes por un tiempo de mi lado que me dejes en paz siempre fue mi manera de ser no me trates de comprender no hay nada que se pueda hacer soy un poco paranoico lo siento

4850498 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles
4850499 ask the russians they are not following the agreement what do they want here
4850500 i want to go to gori ive left my family there i am bringing food for them but they wont let me pass
4850501 im from tbilisi i was here working when the war broke out i was taken in
4850502 im horrified i dont know if its russians or mercenaries doing it
4850503 we are constantly encountering various problems with the georgian side and it will depend how quickly and effectively this problem will be solved
4850504 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces

4850508 during dreaming the primary visual cortex is inactive while secondary areas are active this is similar to when subjects are asked to imagine or recall a visual scene and different from what happens when they are actually seeing the scene
4850509 let the general election be the only mechanism to decide on the individual who is eligible to be the pri
4850510 dont ever park a cadillac in front of a ford house
4850511 i was just wondering what the poor folks are doing
4850512 did you catch the second head fake this lecture wasnt for you its for my kids
4850513 anak sulung saya luar biasa aktif dia juga pintar dan suka sekali bertanya kadang pertanyaannya bikin kami kewalahan teman teman saya bilang si sulung termasuk anak berbakat
4850514 bakat berarti punya potensi sedangkan pintar bisa didapat dari tekun mempelajari sesuatu
4850515 kalau anak tak berbakat musikal misalnya biar dikursuskan musik sehebat apa pun ya kemampuannya sebegitu begitu saja tak akan berkembang
4850516 sebaliknya jika anak berbakat tapi lingkungannya tak menunjang ia pun tak akan berkembang
4850517 jika ia lari ke sana sini pasti ada tujuannya jika ia tertarik pada sesuatu ia akan duduk diam dalam waktu yang lama asyik sendiri mengerjakan sesuatu
4850518 namun tak berarti anak dengan iq rata rata yaitu 90 110 tak akan berbakat
4850519 ada kok anak yang sebelumnya ber iq di bawah rata rata tapi dengan stimulasi dan pendekatan yang baik bisa berubah jadi di atas rata rata
4850520 ia juga harus memiliki task commitment yakni kemampuan pengikatan diri terhadap tugas atau motivasi jadi ada keinginan dan ketekunan untuk menyelesaikan sesuatu
4850521 jadi kalau ia mempreteli barang barang bukan karena dia nakal tapi karena rasa ingin tahunya
4850522 mentang mentang perkembangan motorik anaknya lambat lantas dikira tak berbakat belum tentu lo
4850523 bisa saja terjadi anak yang dulu perkembangan bicaranya lambat ternyata ketika besar menjadi sarjana sastra yang terkenal
4850524 semuanya tergantung dari lingkungan bagaimana stimulasi lingkungan akan sangat mempengaruhi perkembangan bakat anak
4850525 banyak orang tua menganggap bayi belum mengerti apa apa sehingga belum perlu diajak bicara
4850526 itu akan merangsang perkembang bahasanya dan berarti membuatnya terangsang untuk berbicara
4850527 sesekali dekatkan benda benda yang terang ke dekat matanya agar ia bisa melihat jelas atau menyentuhnya ini sama dengan melatih koordinasi antara tangan dan matanya
4850528 orangtua tak melulu membaca tapi juga mengajukan pertanyaan agar si anak terbiasa berpikir kreatif
4850529 dari situ juga akan terlihat derajat besarnya bakat tiap anak
4850530 cukup dengan radio atau teve dari cepatnya si kecil menghapal nyanyian bahkan untuk melodi yang sulit sulit itu sudah menunjukkan bakatnya
4850531 sebaiknya dalam melakukan permainan orang tua juga ikut terjun bermain sehingga anak dapat menikmati kegiatan itu dan mempunyai kepercayaan diri untuk mengembangkannya
4850532 memang anak berbakat akan belajar lebih cepat dan melakukan segala sesuatu lebih baik ketimbang anak biasa sehingga tampaknya tak perlu mendapatkan perhatian khusus padahal tidak demikian
4850533 dampak buruknya ego si anak semakin menghebat dan bisa juga ia rasakan sebagai beban sebab seperti anak anak lainnya ia pun punya masalah emosional
4850534 mencoba menemukan bakat pada setiap anaknya karena masing masing anak punya kekuatan tersendiri sehingga anak tak perlu merasa iri satu sama lain
4850535 let the general election be the only mechanism to decide on the individual who is eligible to be the pri
4850536 weil es sich hier in vielen punkten nicht nur um eine u erst originelle methodologie handelt sondern um eine methode welche die weltweite psychologie und epidemiologie zur weiterentwicklung anregen kann
4850537 aufgrund der oben genannten aspekte finde ich das neue konzept hervorragend
4850538 das konzept ist vern nftig und schl ssig auch die aufteilung der themen ist meiner meinung nach gelungen die sprache finde ich sehr gut getroffen das lesen f llt leicht was das arbeiten mit dem text angenehm gestaltet auch das layout der einzelnen seiten wirkt bersichtlich nicht voll gepackt und ist durch abs tze tabellen und die farbliche gestaltung ansprechend und bersichtlich

4850545 ive always been a fan of racing games and working on need for speed undercover was an amazing experience i was so impressed by the scope and quality of the overall production that goes into a videogame these days it was like any other day on a hollywood set i felt right at home the black box team is doing tremendous work here and i cant wait to see the final game

4850551 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4850552 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4850553 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is not 1968
4850554 the priority now is to ensure that the commitments made in the agreement are speedily and fully implemented
4850555 russian aggression against georgia and threats to other neighbouring countries such as yesterdays to poland are unacceptable and run contrary to the principles of national sovereignty and respect for the territorial integrity of independent countries
4850556 a complete and immediate withdrawal of russian troops to the line they occupied before military action started
4850557 discussions with partners will continue about the right next steps
4850558 there is a long list of charges against him we will file them by the latest by tuesday

4850604 mauritius will be the first sub saharan african nation to do so connecting the island more closely to tourist and business markets in europe
4850605 the use of daylight saving time dst is mostly confined to countries located at high latitudes including all europe except iceland and most of north america
4850606 in africa the use of dst is seldom and in most cases counterproductive as the continents location close to the equator produces only very small differences in daylight in winter and summer
4850607 aligned with that in europe and the united states of america
4850608 pervez musharraf himself is a part of this political instability by staying on he clearly ignored the result of the february 2008 election and therefore creating frustration in the population so his departure is likely to lessen the tension not increase it
4850609 i dont think delaying the merging sorting step and pushing it to the client side is going to get you very far
4850610 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
4850611 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
4850612 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
4850613 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
4850614 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states
4850615 opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu

4850626 she had gone over alban bergs opera wozzeck with aaron when it was new

4850681 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4850682 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system

4850705 gt documented a family of tailorbirds in july 2008 at the admiralty park around woodlands he spent about three weeks stalking the birds almost every morning making use of a cameo hide and photographing with a long lens and not using flash so as not to unnecessarily stress the birds
4850706 when i returned on 28th july the chick had fledged above right and was not present in the nest however i did see the male returning to the nest vicinity at 0945 hours the female and fledgling were not seen in the area and i can conclude that they had left the area

4850738 finally theres a troubling bit of history involving a political campaign trick the gilmore campaign is directed by long time gilmore confidante dick leggitt who testified in a colorado court in 2006 that he fabricated polling data for a gubernatorial campaign he was managing there and gave it to a denver post reporter a violation of state law leggitt resigned from that campaign one week after he admitted under oath that he sent false polling numbers to a reporter according to a may 6 2006 article in the rocky mountain news leggitt said he sent bogus numbers to the denver post but called it spin the newspaper reported and implied that its a common practice among political operatives no mr leggitt not spin fudge websters dictionary defines the non sweet term as put together dishonestly or carelessly fake we agree fudge completely baloney

4850748 rather than put words in her mouth as the opposition does i would like to share a letter lee anne sent me regarding our efforts
4850749 greatly appreciate all the support you and the republican party of virginia gave me during the extremely short campaign period
4850750 i especially appreciate the personal telephone calls you made to prominent republicans in the area who had not yet made up their minds about the election
4850751 let me be clear no matter what my opponent wants to say he just does not get his facts straight
4850752 this is a critical year for republicans in virginia john mccain needs to be able to count on virginia our senate nominee must beat mark warner and we must defend our eight congressional seats this will only happen with all of us working together to grow our party deliver our message energize and get our people to the polls rewriting history and tearing down republicans is not the way for us to succeed
4850753 over the past several months i have been encouraged to run for attorney general of virginia
4850754 after great consideration and deliberation i have decided that i will not be a candidate for that office in 2009

4850765 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4850766 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4850767 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4850768 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4850791 using this new technology this past may and have since been communicating with the public in real time through text messaging and live video streamed directly to the internet i have been able to answer questions take suggestions from the public and become more accountable in my day to day undertakings in washington i am the first to personally send a text message through twitter com on the house floor soliciting your input on current legislation
4850792 i have suddenly found myself on the front lines of a worthwhile campaign to open up congress to every kind of communication on these new media outlets
4850793 this has happened spontaneously and naturally which makes it even more interesting and meaningful because this story demonstrates the speed and power of these new media outlets
4850794 these new tools truly have the power to put we the people in every room in washington d c
4850795 the house rules must be changed to give members of congress full unfettered access to new media in the same way we are given full unfettered access to old media
4850796 everyone deserves a private life but when someone puts himself in the public eye to attain the highest possible position of power and authority that person must be open to public scrutiny
4850797 the isoo annual report presents a unique snapshot of declassification and declassification activity throughout the executive branch though the data provided are often of uncertain significance and are cited with exaggerated precision
4850798 isoo reported uneven compliance with basic classification system rules and regulations at several agencies
4850799 it is perplexing to try to understand why a candidate hasnt pounced on this immensely important issue and made it the platform of his her campaign
4850800 it is certainly a possibility that none of the candidates truly have the intention to push this issue once in the white house these candidates speak of change but it would be this kind of change that would be truly monumental in a democracy do we deserve anything less than truth and openness
4850801 we are moving from what al has done for thousands and the movie for millions we will put together 2 billion sets of eyeballs on a global basis

4850804 i wonder if he is running for president of the united states or for something in arizona when he makes those statements

4850843 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4850844 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4850845 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4850846 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4850847 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4850848 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4850849 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4850850 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4850851 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4850852 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4850853 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4850854 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4850855 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4850856 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4850857 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4850858 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4850859 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4850860 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4850861 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4850862 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4850863 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4850864 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4850865 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4850866 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4850867 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4850868 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4850869 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4850870 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4850871 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4850872 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4850873 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4850874 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4850898 in fact until you mentioned it i didnt think about it its good to have them both back
4850899 even when we were in spartanburg he was still there and i was telling him to watch my technique and let me know when my footwork is bad and when im doing something wrong
4850900 hes been helping out the corners letting us know if youre playing a little too far off or youre playing this way thats why i did this route
4850901 watching film the end man on the line always blocked down on me he never let me come free
4850902 so once he let me come free it put up some flags something wasnt right i didnt know he was going to pitch it i actually thought it was going to be a run fake
4850903 ultimately there needs to be recognition in our immigration program that there are people already in the pacific being displaced because of climate change people having to leave small atolls and islands because of sea level rises
4850904 we think there needs to be a special category in our humanitarian program that recognises the displacement caused by climate change
4850905 australia and new zealand need to be putting resources and planning into how the displacement can be coped with and how that resettlement can take place
4850906 i like to think its just about the boy and the man on the road but obviously you can draw conclusions about all sorts of things from reading the book depending on your taste
4850907 its kind of ingrained in all fathers to protect their children
4850908 i wasnt afraid of the bleakness of the book the darkness of the book
4850909 i think the success of the book took a lot of people by surprise
4850910 his work examines our core the two faces of violence that co exist in every savage act brutal strength of purpose holding hands with a desperate and cowering weakness
4850911 at its core is a primal struggle against the utmost extremes of the natural world and a thrilling evocation of human endurance
4850912 it is an unflinching examination of human beings at their worst and at their best by the end of the film it is the childs innate goodness and grace under fire that changes the man showing us that amidst barbarity our humanity can be inextinguishable
4850913 cant it be a really bad tsunami rather than the apocalypse
4850914 thats not only to heighten the threat but also to get variety
4850915 it just builds on the story that we are creating of the revenge of nature
4850916 we will create a post apocalyptic world that is boldly original and present a vision that will captivate and haunt precisely because of its strange echoes of familiarity

4850946 while some progress has been made on this project it obviously cannot be completed soon enough
4850947 we have completed an initial fact finding and it looks like a combination of confusion over a particular form used by the court to notify us
4850948 i am not in any way blaming the courts this was a department of correction mistake

4850955 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4850956 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4850957 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4850958 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4850959 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4850960 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4850961 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4850962 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4850963 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4850964 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4850965 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4850966 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4850967 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4850968 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4850969 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4850970 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4850971 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4850972 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4850973 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4850974 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4850975 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4850976 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4850977 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4850978 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4850979 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4850980 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4850981 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4850982 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4850983 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4850984 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4850985 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4850986 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4850987 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4850988 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4850989 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4850990 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4850991 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4850992 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4850993 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4850994 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4850995 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4850996 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4850997 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4850998 who are open to doing something on the production side
4850999 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4851000 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4851001 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4851002 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4851003 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4851004 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4851005 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

4851008 the defense flew around today and everyone was going full speed
4851009 there were a couple times though that the offense converted on third and long and we need to do a better job of finishing the stop and getting offenses off the field
4851010 our defense rose up played well and really limited the offense
4851011 there are two ways to look at it one is that our defense really played well and the other is our offense needs to play better we need to run the ball better and do a better job of executing
4851012 we had some success today but we could have run the ball better
4851013 the offense can do a better job and we know we have a lot to work to do
4851014 i think we have four running backs who can really play
4851015 the competition is really close for the two three four spots on the depth chart it is a great problem to have
4851016 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4851017 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4851018 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4851019 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4851020 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4851021 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4851022 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4851023 the chinese did excellent research into how the body energy is affected by food stress muscular problems and the like their research was absolutely secular much like the knowledge behind western medicine we apply that research with a jewish angle and if you look deeply into the theories behind chinese medicine you see kabbalah all around many of us at the school have come to chinese medicine through kabbalah not from applied kabbalah to chinese medicine its amazing everything fits into the kabballistic system
4851024 officials tell us that they are really quite worried about people who would not cooperate who are not aware of what was about to happen
4851025 and just thinking of the mobile homes if people stay and they really are blown all over public officials ambulance services red cross units have to go find these people and provide them with support and services
4851026 seeing so many kids lost in their own creative world on a street i really feel democracy is alive there are two famous mumbai festivals where people come out on the streets and celebrate roads and pavements are meant for people and they should enjoy and take care of them seeing energy levels of the kids reminds me of my own childhood
4851027 we are hoping to build an amusement park with international quality rides
4851028 the rides have not changed much over the last decade and there is need to bring something fresh and exciting for children
4851029 klfd is likely to be completed by this december the ring road will be open to public very shortly and be dotted with more than 3 000 trees
4851030 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4851031 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4851032 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4851033 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4851034 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4851035 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4851036 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4851037 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4851038 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4851039 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4851040 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4851041 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4851042 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4851043 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4851044 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4851045 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4851046 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4851047 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4851048 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4851049 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4851050 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4851051 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4851052 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4851053 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4851054 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4851055 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4851056 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4851057 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4851058 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4851059 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4851060 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4851061 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4851062 the next season is everyone just growing up you get to see miley getting her drivers licence all that good stuff and it could also help parents to see how their kids grow up
4851063 so the next season everybody is awesome everybody is amazing and seeing them growing up is just really cool
4851064 i think its just really surprising i never expected it its just a show for families and im really impressed that everybody loves it all the kids all the parents it has billy ray cyrus which is for the parents for all those people who love his music hes amazing it has everything miley is super talented beautiful amazing and everything and i think we all bring something to the show
4851065 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4851066 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4851067 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4851068 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4851069 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4851070 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4851071 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4851072 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4851073 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4851074 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4851075 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4851076 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4851077 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4851078 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4851079 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4851080 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4851081 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4851082 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4851083 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4851084 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4851085 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4851086 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4851087 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4851088 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4851089 we wanted to celebrate independence day by doing something meaningful our endeavour is to make people understand the true meaning of patriotism around 250 flags have been picked up so far all of them will be deposited at the collectors office where they will be destroyed as per rules
4851090 in shahpur and nehru bridge some commuters stopped their vehicles and helped us pick up the flags we plan to undertake this campaign every year to sensitize people
4851091 the common practice is to wave the flag while singing the national anthem and then dump it nearby most flags were found from crossroads and near dustbins
4851092 across the country police are using gps devices to snare thieves drug dealers sexual predators and killers often without a warrant or court order privacy advocates said tracking suspects electronically constitutes illegal search and seizure violating fourth amendment rights of protection against unreasonable searches and seizures and is another step toward george orwells big brother society law enforcement officials when they discuss the issue at all said gps is essentially the same as having an officer trail someone just cheaper and more accurate most of the time as was done in the foltz case judges have sided with police
4851093 i was a fannishfan and he was tom whitmore a master of fandom but i pitted my wits against him and i won
4851094 o rbitro n o precisava ter tirado dois jogadores nossos n o precisa disso hoje nosso time j tinha problemas
4851095 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4851096 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4851097 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4851098 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4851099 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4851100 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4851101 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4851102 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4851103 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4851104 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4851105 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4851106 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4851107 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4851108 s morgensterns classic tale of true love and high adventure
4851109 fencing fighting torture poison true love hate revenge giants hunters bad men good men beautifulest ladies snakes spiders beasts of all natures and descriptions pain death brave men coward men strongest men chases escapes lies truths passion miracles
4851110 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4851111 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4851112 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4851113 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4851114 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4851115 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4851116 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4851117 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4851118 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4851119 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4851120 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4851121 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4851122 a equipe entrou muito concentrada no jogo e no primeiro tempo encontramos mais espa os para os arremessos da linha de seis metros e na segunda etapa o maik fez boas defesas o que nos proporcionou contra ataques perigosos
4851123 no geral fizemos um bom jogo mas pod amos ter acertado mais arremessos
4851124 fizemos um bom jogo conseguimos impor um ritmo bom sa mos bastante em contra ataques e a defesa foi muito bem o maik pegou muita bola agora d pra acreditar mais
4851125 of course were concerned about the impact on the economy but we think its worth it
4851126 itll make us more creative we need to learn from the united states and other developed countries about how to build cleaner more creative more high tech industries
4851127 at the central government level there is very clear awareness that china is facing an environmental crisis
4851128 theres an awareness that environmental problems lead to social conflict and thats always a concern for the government here
4851129 walking down the street before you couldnt even see until the end of the block it was so dark and hazy
4851130 of course this is much better whats the point of living here with all that pollution
4851131 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4851132 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4851133 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4851134 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4851135 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4851136 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4851137 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
4851138 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
4851139 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4851140 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4851141 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4851142 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others

4851145 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4851146 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4851147 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4851148 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4851149 eventually eroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial brilliance and fundamentals are definitely eroding in the newspaper industry a trend that has caused the profits of our buffalo news to decline the skid will almost certainly continue almost all newspaper owners realize that they are constantly losing ground in the battle for eyeballs simply put if cable and satellite broadcasting as well as the internet had come along first newspapers as we know them probably would never have existed however the economic potential of a newspaper internet site given the many alternative sources of information and entertainment that are free and only a click away is at best a small fraction of that existing in the past for a print newspaper facing no competition the days of lush profits from our newspaper are over

4851152 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4851153 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4851154 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4851155 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4851156 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4851157 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4851158 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4851159 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4851160 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4851209 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4851210 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

4851230 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4851231 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics

4851244 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4851245 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4851246 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4851247 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4851248 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4851249 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4851250 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere

4851256 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body

4851259 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4851260 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4851261 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4851262 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4851263 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4851264 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4851265 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4851266 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4851267 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4851268 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4851269 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4851270 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be

4851274 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4851275 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4851276 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4851277 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4851278 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush

4851282 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4851283 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4851284 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges

4851289 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4851290 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4851291 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4851292 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
4851293 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4851294 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4851295 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4851296 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4851297 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4851298 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4851299 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4851300 what do you want your look to say to people
4851301 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4851302 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4851303 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4851304 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4851305 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4851306 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4851307 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4851308 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4851309 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4851310 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4851311 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4851312 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4851313 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4851314 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4851315 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4851316 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4851317 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4851318 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4851319 at home our students are playing soul caliber iv on the wii and in the classroom were giving them multiple choice quizzes with radio buttons flashcards that could easily have been made on hypercard and static cartoons apparently created with the free clipart that came with your word processing program a decade ago
4851320 i dont know why any more southern guys didnt come up i think theyre kind of crazy not to come up and try a race like this
4851321 weve been struggling with the rear end fighting that finally got it somewhat squared away and now were just still testing a few things because i think we were a little bit stronger last year with where we were at id like to get back there
4851322 its hard to get a handle because its pretty rough
4851323 well get it well work hard and well get it squared away
4851324 ive been saying all year that teammate trevor sanborns car was better than ours but we just struggled with it last week at halifax during a practice day we just sat around we were sick of banging our heads against the wall
4851325 i just tried to explain what was going on and we started to try some other stuff the only things we hadnt tried i think were starting to narrow it down
4851326 here were decent im a little free off but that was the first time out for everybody this week well let it get rubbered up let it cool off later and then try it
4851327 uh oh i was supposed to deliver the sunday paper for david duvall
4851328 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4851329 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4851330 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4851331 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4851332 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4851333 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4851334 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4851335 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4851336 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4851337 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4851338 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4851339 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4851340 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4851341 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4851342 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4851343 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4851344 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4851345 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4851346 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4851347 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4851348 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4851349 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4851350 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4851351 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4851352 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4851353 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4851354 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4851355 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4851356 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4851357 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4851358 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4851359 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4851360 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4851361 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4851362 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4851363 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4851364 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4851365 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4851366 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4851367 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4851368 you dont mind if your top player is in control its when your mediocre player is in control
4851369 im not talking about any player in particular im just talking about the state of the game in general a contracts a contract therefore it should be worth something
4851370 in my day the players had no power whatsoever and you always felt you were hard done by and that no one was there to support you in our day we yearned for a halfway house but now it has gone miles in the other direction
4851371 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4851372 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4851373 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4851374 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4851375 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4851376 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4851377 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4851378 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4851379 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4851380 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4851381 just so you all know we did set a record
4851382 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4851383 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4851384 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4851385 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4851386 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4851387 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4851388 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4851389 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4851390 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4851391 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4851392 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4851393 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4851394 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4851395 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4851396 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4851397 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4851398 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4851399 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4851400 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4851401 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4851402 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4851403 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4851404 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4851405 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4851406 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4851407 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4851408 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4851409 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4851410 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4851411 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4851412 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4851413 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4851414 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4851415 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4851416 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4851417 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4851418 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4851419 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4851420 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4851421 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4851422 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4851423 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4851424 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4851425 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4851426 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4851427 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party
4851428 oh dontcha know our neighbor carl is showin off quite a pair of antlers on the canadian pr0n channel eh

4851430 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4851431 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4851432 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4851433 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4851434 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4851435 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4851436 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4851437 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4851438 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4851439 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4851440 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4851441 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4851442 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4851443 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4851444 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4851445 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4851446 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4851447 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4851448 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4851449 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4851450 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4851451 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4851452 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4851453 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4851454 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4851455 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4851456 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4851457 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4851458 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4851459 mujer grande es tu fe que te suceda como deseas
4851460 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4851461 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4851462 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4851463 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4851464 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4851465 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4851466 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4851467 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4851468 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4851469 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4851470 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4851471 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4851472 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4851473 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4851474 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4851475 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4851476 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4851477 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4851478 qu significa la paz en un mundo en el que la riqueza de 587 billonarios supera el producto interno bruto conjunto de los 135 pa ses m s pobres del mundo
4851479 i am a railing beside the stream he who can grasp me let him grasp me i am not however your crutch
4851480 there is always a certain madness in love but this is always a certain method in madness
4851481 now i am nimble now i fly now i see myself under myself now a god dances within me
4851482 i desired my destruction when i wanted to ascend into the heights and you are the lightning for which i have been waiting
4851483 to me you are still a prisoner who imagines freedom ah such prisoners of the soul become clever but also deceptive and base
4851484 yes i know your peril but by my love and hope i entreat you do not reject your love and hope
4851485 but by my love and hope i entreat you do not reject the hero in your soul keep holy your highest hope
4851486 if you believed more in life you would devote less to the moment
4851487 i know the hatred and envy of your hearts you are not great enough not to know hatred and envy so be great enough not to be ashamed of them and if you cannot be saints of knowledge at least be its warriors
4851488 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4851489 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4851490 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4851491 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4851492 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4851493 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4851494 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4851495 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4851496 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4851497 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

4851502 the mighty leaders of israel protectors of the land even after they return their souls to the bosom of their father in heaven not only do they not depart from the sheep of their flock but furthermore they ascend to the base of the supernal throne to appear before the splendor of the exalted g d to protect the jewish nation to demand the mercy and kindness of the father for his children his nation his heritage

4851504 the candle of g d is the soul of man
4851505 will destroy death for ever and the l rd g d will wipe away tears from off all faces
4851506 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4851507 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4851508 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4851509 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

4851530 the city of brotherly love has a tight housing market just 1 9 vacancy reflecting the lure of a charming and historic american city steeped in tradition this city is priced well with a median home price of 234 900 up from 215 000 in 2005 with abundant cultural outlets including universities museums and theaters philly is a great place to call home

4851536 the question i posed in the column was not do works of literature philosophy and history have instrumental value but does the academic analysis of works of literature philosophy and history have instrumental value
4851537 but it would be disappointing if in the course of this campaign the attention of the voting public shifts to gender and race instead of dealing with the substantive issues
4851538 the cesspool of misogyny in contemporary rap has no effect on the wider culture
4851539 the graveyard is full of tombstones that say he had the right of way
4851540 there are people in this world that dont love their fellow human beings and i hate people like that
4851541 several of their associates described the action as a protest over what the three deputies regarded as ms pauloses ideologically driven and dictatorial managerial style
4851542 ms pauloses defenders at justice department headquarters said the criticism of her was unwarranted they said older lawyers had difficultly dealing with a young aggressive woman who had tried to put into place policies important to mr gonzales like programs to combat child exploitation
4851543 but i would also say that theres nobody on my staff who would still be working for me if they made a comment like that about anybody of any ethnic group and i would hope that nbc ends up having that same attitude
4851544 if the prosecutor is obliged to choose his cases it follows that he can choose his defendants therein is the most dangerous power of the prosecutor that he will pick people that he thinks he should get rather than pick cases that need to be prosecuted with the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone in such a case it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books or putting investigators to work to pin some offense on him it is in this realm in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies it is here that law enforcement becomes personal and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group being attached to the wrong political views or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself
4851545 t he prosecutor has more control over life liberty and reputation than any other person in america his discretion is tremendous he can have citizens investigated and if he is that kind of person he can have this done to the tune of public statements and veiled or unveiled intimations
4851546 the citizens safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human kindness who seeks truth and not victims who serves the law and not factional purposes
4851547 the message of the ongoing imus scandal is simple verbal offenses against anyone other than conservatives or christians or jews will be treated as crimes and jesse jackson and al sharpton are the judge and jury
4851548 what the left is doing is not a fluke its a concerted strategy and it works so if you cant beat em join em thats why i am calling on conservatives to use the available media radio talk shows blogs letters to the editor to protest and demand that rosie odonnell be kicked off the view
4851549 they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

4851555 i feel pretty good about where we are right now
4851556 for as much banging and work as weve done were pretty healthy
4851557 youre going to have your bumps and bruises we dont have anything career ending or season ending so were ok there
4851558 offensively we had a real good day yesterday defensively we didnt have as good a day we had a hard go on thursday and we took a step back in some areas yesterday there were just some specific guys who didnt come out and approach the practice like we needed to today we challenged them and they responded theres good competition on both sides of the ball both sides are learning and i think were about where we want to be right now
4851559 i feel pretty good about our first group on both sides of the ball
4851560 theres a lot to be fixed but were trying to build depth and see more guys who are going to step to the forefront and see how much the young guys have learned to see who can contribute i ts a constant evaluation process going on on top of that were working special teams to see who the guys are there i think as a football team weve gotten better but we also know that theres a lot more out there for us to achieve
4851561 its good that its all past but one thing i know about khiry from when i recruited him is that hes a young man of character and his word
4851562 when he came here he told me he was done with signing with the angels once he came here his mind was full into football he wasnt trying to play one against the other he and his mom made a decision that the best thing for him was to be here at at that point they were shut down so i felt fine about it

4851580 fue una muerte sorprendente por la imagen de dureza de la represi n que transmiti
4851581 no ha habido una estructura detr s que mantuviese a verdejo como un h roe
4851582 el entierro s fue impresionante y durante unos a os hubo homenajes pero nada m s aqu la gente es muy dada a olvidar
4851583 no m s que los dem s muertos en similares circunstancias creo que la democracia debe un reconocimiento a todos ellos no s lo a verdejo aqu en almer a los que fuimos antifranquistas s lo recordamos pero era muy dif cil que el recuerdo llegase a toda andaluc a
4851584 ellos tomaron una actitud muy particular que todos respetamos pero con la que evidentemente se puede no estar de acuerdo

4851590 and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy them
4851591 now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling
4851592 pay no attention to those biblical glorifications of merciless slaughter and destruction behind the curtain the great and powerful
4851593 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
4851594 found out the bible has soooooooooooo many holes and wasnt even translated correctly into english so what really are we reading
4851595 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4851596 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4851597 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4851598 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4851599 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4851600 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4851601 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4851602 the model looks like shes going to cut a bitch
4851603 modified turned up slightly at the ends gives a bit of a face lift
4851604 these are okay but for 30 more i could have bought something i loved
4851605 we have come here with the approval of the georgian people
4851606 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
4851607 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
4851608 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4851609 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
4851610 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
4851611 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
4851612 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
4851613 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
4851614 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
4851615 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
4851616 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
4851617 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
4851618 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
4851619 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
4851620 the fact russian forces have moved so far into georgian territory will be seen as an act of provocation
4851621 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
4851622 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
4851623 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
4851624 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
4851625 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
4851626 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
4851627 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
4851628 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
4851629 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
4851630 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
4851631 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
4851632 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
4851633 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these re russia invades province of georgia after georgia attacks russians videos
4851634 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4851635 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4851636 information is no longer a staff function but an operational one it is deadly as well as useful
4851637 russia is an aggressor we are a small democratic country please help us
4851638 if the russians stop hostilities now they will have redrawn the whole strategic situation in the caucasus to the detriment of the americans
4851639 no one will invest in georgia in oil pipelines in new ventures there now the game is over in the new version of the great game the russians can cash in
4851640 at the moment it appears that russia will have gotten positive benefits from the use of force across its border
4851641 for medvedev the outcome is a war thats been won its his personal victory
4851642 the image of medvedev is the biggest casualty we and the west were hoping that russia at last had a young liberal reforming leader now after these events he comes off looking like a tough guy and there is an impression that hes totally dependent on putin
4851643 this moment could well mark the end of an era in europe during which realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by new cooperative norms and a countrys right to choose its own path
4851644 while no one wants a return to cold war style confrontation moscows behavior poses a direct challenge to european and international order
4851645 a russia that has the means of force and is ready to use it spells a whole new situation
4851646 all neighboring countries will have to take this into account much depends on how russia behaves if it tries to dictate terms that will have a very negative effect but my impression is that russia was quite restrained and carefully calculated each move it seems likely that nato will be paralyzed
4851647 meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4851648 we saw them arriving in the capital south ossetia has become a symbol of a powerful russia a russia that seems to be expanding its territory
4851649 theres no gas no electricity no water in the city
4851650 its all because of our leadership its not our fault but were the ones who suffer
4851651 were expecting humanitarian help from tbilisi like bread and sugar
4851652 the people who sit in their armchairs maybe they want it but we dont want it
4851653 we expect the united states to adopt a responsible approach it is especially important to refrain from any steps that could directly or indirectly be taken by the georgian leadership as encouragement of its revanchist ambitions and prompt a repeated tragic scenario

4851655 i think we all have a collective sigh of relief because with these knee injuries a lot can happen and you are talking about the career of a young man who has put his face on this organization and a player who we care deeply about
4851656 i can tell you this i didnt sleep a whole lot last night and i feel very very good about where we are today we are in great position to have him ready by the regular season
4851657 the oil and gas pipelines passing through georgia with supplies for the west that dont pass through russia and are therefore not potential instruments of russian blackmail are an important western interest justifying the west in supporting georgia against the threat of russian interference
4851658 if georgia had been admitted to nato membership at the nato meeting in bucharest last april as some of us proposed its unlikely that russia would have dared to send its tanks and troops into georgia itself on the flimsy pretext of protecting its own citizens in south ossetia
4851659 russias policies and actions are a throw back to by gone soviet days and have no place in the europe of 2008 its military invasion of georgia has no legal basis and constitutes clear aggression its important that the international community should not allow aggression to succeed a military response is ruled out as disproportionate and too dangerous but russia must be subjected to other penalties as a deterrent to any repetition of this unacceptable behaviour these could include postponement of russian membership of the world trade organisation suspension from the g8 a western boycott of the 2014 winter olympics in sochi and other kinds of boycott and isolation until moscow realises that aggression and other bullying do not pay

4851663 there is only a fine line between being relevant to its surrounding culture and being absorbed by that culture american evangelicalism has stepped over this line 2
4851664 properly understood thats akin to asking whether you can be too christlike
4851665 in other words the community goes deep into the word in order to answer the questions of their culture they practice those answers in the world and then reflect biblically again
4851666 i dropped it into a good lie where i didnt have too many options
4851667 i had a good lie to flop it honestly i was thinking to try and get it about 10 feet past the hole and make that putt for par
4851668 im to a point now where ive gotten myself in this position or around this position and im getting more comfortable
4851669 i put a new putter in play a few weeks ago and since then i have made just about everything ive looked at
4851670 its happened every so often im the type of putter that when they start going in i tend to make a whole lot im really streaky ive always made a lot of putts from inside eight feet and i seem to have it close from outside 15 to 20 feet once that first one goes in they all seem to start going in
4851671 ive had a lot of good things going on the last few weeks it just keeps building and building
4851672 all the hard work is finally coming into its own
4851673 im in a good position but obviously i need to get off to a good start and put some pressure on the leaders
4851674 its hard work on this tour there are so many good players out here i know that every shot could make a big difference for the rest of my life
4851675 what does your tradition do so well that you could lead the rest of us in
4851676 passion is what other christian traditions can learn from us
4851677 they have passion they really think they can change the world
4851678 in gree the word signifies literally that which happens to a person or thing an experience undergone passively hence an appetite or impulse such as anger desire or jealousy that violently dominates the soul many greek fathers regard the passionas as something intrisically evil a disease of the soul thus st john klimakos affirms that god is not the creator of the passions and that they are unnatural alien to mans true self other greek fathers however look upon the passions as impulses originally placed in man by god and so fundamentally good although at present distorted by sin cf isaiah the solitary section 1 on this second view then the passions are to be educated not eradicated to be transfigured not suppressed to be used positively not negatively
4851679 please understand my reasons for not speaking today i am participating in the day of silence a national youth movement protesting the silence faced by lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people and their allies in schools my deliberate silence echoes that silence which is caused by harassment prejudice and discrimination i believe that ending the silence is the first step toward fighting these injustices think about the voices you are not hearing today what are you going to do to end the silence

4851682 in 2000 royal as the then minister of the family and children spoke out against anti gay bullying in schools saying
4851683 it is necessary in my opinion to step up against homophobia to recognise and respect each other with our differences
4851684 a law passed in february 2002 introduced by royal on behalf of the jospin government gave legal recognition for the first time to families with same sex parents part of the laws object

4851688 well were movin on up to the east side weve finally got a piece of the pie
4851689 con esa misma convicci n mi gobierno y a trav s de l todas las instituciones y la sociedad concurriremos a la convocatoria para celebrar el consejo de seguridad p blica el pr ximo jueves en palacio nacional
4851690 como usted lo ha convocado participando en el consejo nacional de seguridad
4851691 una hora en que con usted m xico y veracruz lo acompa an y dicen ya basta a los que violan la ley y cometen cr menes contra todos los mexicanos
4851692 todos unidos contra la violencia y la inseguridad contra los delincuentes y los enemigos de la ley y de m xico
4851693 s que es una medida entre muchas que hay que tomar pero un viaje de mil millas comienza con un paso y me parece que si alguien que secuestra a un menor de edad o a una persona y la mutila o la asesina no merece salir nunca de la c rcel esa es mi opini n y la sostengo en cualquier terreno
4851694 si bien es cierto esta medida no resuelve todo el problema s pone las bases de una parte medular del problema el haber aprobado ayer la cadena perpetua para los secuestradores particularmente en aquellos casos agraviados por tortura u homicidios de las v ctimas
4851695 lo felicitamos encarecidamente porque queremos dejarles a nuestros hijos y nietos un m xico limpio un m xico como el que usted est forjando no sabe c mo distingue su administraci n la decisi n que tiene de luchar contra el narcotr fico y el crimen organizado que es un reclamo usted tom la bandera con mucho nimo e inteligencia
4851696 lo hemos estado constatando con la lucha incansable que hace usted en contra del crimen organizado esto quiere decir que asegura el futuro de los j venes y el bienestar de todos los mexicanos
4851697 hay que hacer que las instituciones le sirvan a la comunidad no somos siervos del siglo xii no estamos al servicio del poder el poder nos debe servir a nosotros
4851698 la capacitaci n no es la f rmula para erradicar la corrupci n sino los l deres mexicanos egresados de harvard no hubieran dado los espect culos que hemos visto no hay una correlaci n directa entre capacitaci n educaci n y corrupci n son dos aspectos distintos
4851699 se hicieron esfuerzos acad micos de capacitaci n en todo el pa s se les dieron cursos de capacitaci n en todos los niveles y adem s se dio un equipamiento que los polic as de este pa s nunca hab an so ado se gast en equipo de transmisi n armamento uniforme transporte algo que nunca se hab a hecho empero la pregunta sigue siendo por qu estamos as
4851700 el gobierno entr en una crisis econ mica y de seguridad y esa crisis no la pudieran afrontar bajo las nuevas normas porque quer an ser al mismo tiempo transparentes pero no serlo tener derechos humanos pero no cumplirlos lo que se llama el gatopardismo
4851701 lo que digo no tiene m s que l gica advierte el entrevistado porque hay un hecho qu hace el ej rcito cuando llega a cada poblaci n detiene de entrada a los polic as
4851702 y estos se ores polic as ya no le sirven s lo al poder p blico sino al f ctico
4851703 el criterio de tener una polic a federal nica se ha venido dando desde ya hace bastantes a os se ha venido incrementando ese criterio pero volvemos a lo mismo la polic a federal nica no le va a dar m s de 20 mil gentes todos los servicios de polic a nacional son m s de 400 mil y los otros 380 qu van a quedar al aire
4851704 tenemos 380 mil polic as locales y lo primero que hace el ej rcito cuando va a poner orden es detener a los polic as para poder contener el delito m s claro no puede estar
4851705 bueno entonces porqu no se une todo en su conjunto
4851706 lo que es bueno es lo que funciona el problema est en la funcionalidad del sistema un sistema que da resultados uno ya ni cuestiona si son de un grupo u otro si vienen de otra lo importante es que funcione
4851707 ah es donde est el problema porque esto se plante para servir al poder nosotros debemos tener polic as como los carabineros de chile que no est n al servicio de la presidenta sino de los chilenos y la poblaci n as lo siente y los apoyan porque les funciona
4851708 carecen de transparencia en sus operaciones no rinden cuentas conforme a lo establecido en la ley federal de entidades paraestatales y sus resultados no son revelados en la cuenta p blica federal
4851709 se han advertido debilidades y deficiencias que afectan las finanzas y la productividad del sector petrolero como son una carga fiscal excesiva diferimiento de proyectos de inversi n planta y equipo obsoleto asignaci n de contratos sin transparencia estructura org nica obesas marco normativo complejo sistemas de control interno deficientes inadecuada operaci n de pidiregas y una pol tica laboral y pensionaria con altos costos
4851710 ante los graves problemas que vive el pa s no podemos tornarnos sordos y ciegos y actuar como el avestruz pensando que con esconder la cabeza la realidad desaparece
4851711 an lisis sobre la reforma energ tica gonz lez de arag n resalt que el fondo de estabilizaci n de ingresos petroleros feip durante el periodo 2003 2007 recibi recursos fiscales excedentes por 61 mil millones de pesos los cuales han sido manejados de forma discrecional al amparo de las reglas de operaci n que lo rigen
4851712 por lo hace al r gimen fiscal de pemex la ley federal de derechos es confusa y poco clara respecto del m todo y criterios para determinar la base sobre la cual se pagan los derechos sobre hidrocarburos por lo cual en 2006 el sistema de administraci n tributaria sat autoriz a pemex un procedimiento de c lculo sustitutivo cuya aplicaci n origin un pago menor de derechos por 7 mil 600 millones de pesos
4851713 somos responsables de cerrar los espacios al uso inadecuado de los recursos a la opacidad con la que se manejan y la discrecionalidad con la que se aplican
4851714 no podemos aceptar que al amparo de las acciones de modernizaci n prevalezcan los factores de riesgo que invitan a la opacidad y a la corrupci n
4851715 you see it is not about church its about the church that is the people who actively participate in the intentional advancement of gods kingdom in partnership with the holy spirit and other believers
4851716 more than anywhere else he loses me when he says so if you are a revolutionary it is becasue you have sensed and responded to gods calling to be such an imitator of christ
4851717 i like our church because im never made to feel guilty
4851718 monday its all about being one of the 12 guys moving on to thursday i believe having been there before in 2004 is a definite advantage for me i know the routine and i am one of the more experienced guys in the field
4851719 its just about going to work and doing what im capable of doing to get to the finals i am as consistent a jumper as there is in the world over the last six years so i just want to maintain that and get to the finals then see if i can hit another big jump and medal
4851720 hey its the olympic games if youre human its exciting but the key is to use that energy in a positive manner control it and channel it relax focus on your task at hand not what surrounds you control what you can and thats your performance keep everything around you as peaceful as possible
4851721 it allowed me to realize that its just another stadium and just another track once you get your mind wrapped around it all it definitely prevents the shock of seeing the facilities for the first time on game day
4851722 things are going really well i had a really great training camp down in dalian
4851723 being in the training camp and not having anything to do but train created and stirred my five ring olympic fever watching video of his training sessions i was hitting positions that you can only picture and imagine if im able to duplicate and hit thee same positions from a full run in competition i could easily walk away from here as the gold medalist
4851724 its funny how my career has come full circle and here i am in beijing again
4851725 i definitely have great memories of 2001 that was a time when i was struggling to stay in the sport because of the finances and i needed to have something big happen and i was blessed that it did that does give me some additional confidence knowing the success i experienced here before
4851726 its a wide open competition we have three great jumpers on our team coming out of the olympic trials and our chances are as good as anyones
4851727 i never met up with him but im real glad dr dre offered us some headphones i like headphones i had a lot of different headsets they are nice they are good
4851728 we saw some good things that will help us get ready for our opener against baylor
4851729 on nine took a rescue club looked to my friend dennis said here goes nothing par
4851730 you got to love them for that but at the same time its a competitive sport
4851731 we were an awesome race team last year had one of the best years that ive ever had and steve was the guy that was guiding that ship so i believe one hundred percent in him your confidence gets down and a lot of things happen performances arent always there and its the toughest thing to rebound from that and thats kind of the situation were in right now were working really hard we tested this week in kentucky and we just continue to work hard at it
4851732 all those things contributed to the type of day we had not to mention robby gordon spinning me out on the last lap my favorite part about it was mark martin sending me a text he said hey man we had a tough day but its tough days that make you appreciate the good ones a lot more you know hes so right and i appreciated that very much thats the way we think and focus
4851733 again even though weve been hit or miss this year i feel like those last ten races are all good tracks for us other than texas texas is a track that has been our achilles heel and were going to work hard to try to fix that when youre looking at a deficit of eighty or ninety points going into it from the way kyle busch has been running this year thats a lot to overcome we know we need some bonus points before we start that chase and all our focus is on is racing hard and trying to get those wins and get the best finishes that we can
4851734 no were not in a position to take a gamble right now were in a tricky position right now because we have one or two bad finishes where we could find ourselves very easily slipping back and not be secure going into richmond we want to be secure going into richmond and so these next couple of weeks if we put good finishes together then we might be in a position to take some more risks i say risks its experimenting with things that youre testing its taking gambles on pit strategy calls those types of things
4851735 i pay attention to it i try not to get too caught up in it because it doesnt change how we approach things every weekend unless you have a big points lead or if youre on the outside of the top twelve if youre on the outside of the top twelve youre going for broke right now youre taking gambles when youre up front you got nothing to lose we were in that position last year right now were pretty much just kind of doing what we normally do which is go out there race hard clean and put the best average finish we can together
4851736 i think that its being able to get to the front
4851737 if you have a car thats working good you could take a few more gambles to maintain the track position if your car is not good enough then youve got to work on it and put four tires on it thats what we need this week is a good enough car to be able to stay out or take two tires and do some of those things that are paying off for those other guys
4851738 when have we ever complained about horsepower horsepower is not an issue with us not at all power is good
4851739 yeah as i get older it gets a little bit more difficult every race every year is crucial and important and you want to do well and you feel like youve got the team capable of doing well and its always frustrating its just how you show it i feel like if i go stomping my feet and throwing things around here it doesnt make me run good it doesnt make it any better so going back to the fans talking and calling in and stuff the reason why i dont really respond to that is because we respond to it internally we deal with it internally like any good business should when you start getting into trying to explain to outsiders it doesnt make it any better i only hope that our fans support me and steve and the whole team and i know that they are they just want us to do good the funniest thing happened to me in 2000 i had a fan come up to me and said you need to tell robbie loomis he needs to get that thing going and i said hey trust me weve got as much on the line as anybody and he goes im losing a lot of money on all my bets every weekend because i pick you every weekend and thats when it hit me how far the fans take it and why they take it so avidly for many different reasons it could be that type of situation or it could be just that theyve been a longtime fan and their pride is on the line but i still promise you we all have a lot more on the line than anybody else
4851740 no i meant i dont stomp around and throw things out here laughter i do plenty of that dont worry we handle things the way that i feel like is productive and you dont just turn the other cheek you dont deny whats going on you face it head on everybody handles it professionally and you can only have the type of relationship like steve and i have where we dont take things personally he can criticize me and i can criticize him and we only want to get better and know that hes the leader of this team and im the best tool that he can possibly have to help make the car better and i have a responsibility he has a responsibility and thats where our focus is
4851741 no were very fortunate in that sense were not having a terrible year you know its frustrating because i know were capable of running better and we should be but we still are sixth in the points weve been outside of the chase before so weve had worse years so its nothing that we need to start quitting our jobs and moving to other teams and all of that type of things its nothing like that and were fortunate that when we do have tough seasons that our guys dont leave were still able to continue to get quality people at our organization and thats what gets us through the tough times

4851750 its a matter of logic that there was a creator to you
4851751 so how do you know that creator only existed for a period of time to create and then died
4851752 the laws of logic cannot exist without the god of christianity
4851753 if reasonable historical proof as you see it changed in favor of another religious belief would you decide not to accept your current beliefs on faiths and actually feel another religion was more

4851787 there were guidelines that existed about how there could be discussions with the child and those guidelines were there to prevent further trauma to the child
4851788 when those guidelines were not followed there was a concern of possible further trauma to the child
4851789 they had the smoking gun in front of their face and they just choose not to follow the trail
4851790 in spite of these strict orders there were at least three other children in the cannon household
4851791 raped molested sexually and physically assaulted intimidated and otherwise abused dakota
4851792 terrible he had a lot of emotional issues before this because his mom was in prison for drug and alcohol related offenses and apparently there was sexual abuse early in his life he wasnt exactly in the best of shape emotionally before this and the events surrounding what happened have exacerbated it he has a hard time communicating verbally
4851793 prone to lashing out exposing himself and otherwise instigating instances in which he may create an environment that would invite sexual abuse and assault by other male children this was a primary reason why dakota was to be placed in a foster care environment without other children
4851794 that was the key element that was supposed to be met in addition to the treatment he needed in a temporary foster situation
4851795 unfortunately for whatever reason catholic community services or dhs or somebody dropped the ball and he was placed in a home with another foster child and the background he had was not suitable for that
4851796 i dont believe based on what i can tell that the cannons had a clue that that single child in the home was supposed to be the situation i think they still needed to maintain supervision and make sure the kid didnt get hurt and so forth those are different issues and responsibilities but in regards to the communication that was between the state and the agent they contracted with catholic community services
4851797 were unaware of such a case and in any event we are bound by customer confidentiality so we would be completely unavailable to comment

4851816 i wasnt as focused as i was if i was at a smaller show
4851817 so when i went out there it wasnt that i was nervous i kind of had cold feet i didnt get that mental game together before i came out there
4851818 so it took me a while to get comfortable the more i landed punches and the more i avoided his attacks my creative juices got flowing my comfort got flowing and thats when i started opening up a bit
4851819 the first knee to the groin was legit i definitely kneed him to the groin it was a total accident
4851820 im a lot taller than most of my opponents when i throw a knee it usually lands to my opponents face or chest him being a tall guy i kind of caught him a little low it was a total accident
4851821 he took enough time and got to catch his breath all the rest of the knees i think was just acting a little bit trying to get the crowd and the judges on his side i had no respect for that
4851822 i definitely felt the knee but youre in a fight i felt the knee it was a legit knee but it wasnt enough to drop me so you fight through it some guys just dont have that mental edge
4851823 i fought a guy whos 5 0 in the ifl and it showed me a lot
4851824 it shows me that i can do this and i do belong in the ufc
4851825 quinton rampage jackson his manager contacted me right after the fight and we exchanged information
4851826 i know that quinton and cheick kongo want to fly me out to their gym to give them a different look as far as workout partners
4851827 so im excited about that i get to work out with one of the best 205 pounders in the game im sure thats going to help me out a lot
4851828 im sure there will be lots more cases of me being the underdog
4851829 but i definitely think i earned the respect of the ufc with the performance i put on
4851830 anyone who watches that fight knows that when it comes to stand up they dont know what to expect i think its going to be hard to train for a fighter like me especially when i get my jiu jitsu a little bit stronger
4851831 i definitely think i have a lot more underdog fights to come especially with me being so young being so new to the game but i definitely know that even though im going to be the underdog ill be the respected underdog
4851832 im ready to get in there right away i love staying in my groove i dont really like to take too much time off
4851833 im hungry to fight more hopefully they throw me back in there as soon as possible
4851834 i think that choice and gay rights are fundamental issues left to individuals particularly i think if you are a conservative you should say government should get out of the bedroom
4851835 i attended the workshop yesterday what a brilliant day i went from not sure i was going to do a season and it wasnt going to be this year to booking a cookery course and definitely going out this year it was really helpful to see the presentations and have people to talk to very sad i didnt get a greeneye top had my eye on the white one anyway a big thank you and looking forward to skiing
4851836 a lot of these guys just need to calm down
4851837 if you go out there trying to impress the coaches you just look bad it messes with your head you just have to play your game and trust that you have what it takes you know theyll never make this team playing like that
4851838 im still hungry but i have the benefit of experience you know these kids need to learn to relax
4851839 its very exciting and its great to be here in phoenix
4851840 its a hotbed of talent there is a fantastic amount of talent out here as well as support for sports teams we believe the community will be very supportive of us now that were here this is their local team
4851841 not all major cities or territories have as many sports options as the phoenix area does
4851842 what that says to me is that this is a fantastic sports community and that they take care of their teams if we do our job then i dont see why we cant be successful
4851843 the people here at greenway have been nothing short of phenomenal
4851844 theyve been a big help to us and the way they have opened their arms to us has been great
4851845 i came out here from kansas where i played with their united states basketball league team
4851846 ive been out here for a while now and im still trying to pursue my basketball dreams you know i live just down the road so i thought why not give it a shot
4851847 were not the phoenix suns and were not trying to be
4851848 were a pick up team but were going to try to be the best pick up team in the league
4851849 i still love her im not really over her yet

4851856 it will eventually run its course and then we can get back to the business of consumption and dominating the planet as we have been told to do by god oops i mean science
4851857 i came here just to win and i did just that i didn t even know i d broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4851858 now i m just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and i m going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
4851859 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest

4851896 sono ufficialmente la sig amy hartzler ha scritto josh e io ci siamo sposati ed stata la cosa pi incredibile che mi sia capitata nella vita
4851897 adesso ho bisogno di un avvocato ha dichiarato gray che si legga tutto il casino di documenti e mi dica cosa quando e come potr raccontare ai veri fan quello che successo ammesso che me lo lascino dire
4851898 quando ho detto che john e rocky erano pronti per andarsene era quello che intendevo spiega ancora amy ai fan non si sono fatti molti problemi a far capire che degli evanescence se ne fregavano e che rimanevano soltanto per i soldi ho lasciato che questa negativit permanesse nella mia band per molto tempo perch ero spaventata da una separazione ho trattato john e rocky con gentilezza e rispetto e non ho ricevuto altro che gelosia e risentimento
4851899 una piccola falsit riportata dalla stampa rocky non se n andato insiste amy non ha mai parlato a me o al nostro management al riguardo disse allo staff che aveva deciso di lasciare il gruppo nelle due settimane dopo la prima parte del tour in sud africa nel periodo in cui mi sarei sposata e non avrei avuto il tempo di sostituirlo fortunatamente siamo stati capaci di sostituirlo in tempo e continuare il tour come previsto

4851909 long term residents committed to making a contribution to britain who cannot engage with other people in their neighbourhoods let alone play an active role in their communities simply because their lack of english prevents it
4851910 small organisations often feel helpless when they are informed from on high that their funding is being withdrawn or services are being cut this project will give them the information and support they need to challenge unjust decisions taken by public bodies it will help them develop the confidence to engage in a robust dialogue making litigation an option of last resort to tackle those public bodies that continue to shirk their responsibilities
4851911 the guide will make statutory bodies realise that many mrcos are properly equipped to deliver services and will help mrcos to understand how to better sell their hard work
4851912 this guide should be read by every central and local government official so that when they commission services they are able to draw on and include the energy and ideas of the migrant and refugee communities
4851913 its an invaluable and timely guide for both mrcos looking to develop services and bodies seeking to commission them
4851914 we have developed the basis project with support from the big lottery fund because we are committed to improving the capacity of rcos to deliver services to members of their communities
4851915 we also recognise the importance of their role in supporting their communities and influencing the services of statutory and voluntary sector organisations to improve services for refugees and asylum seekers
4851916 and they play a vital role in helping the integration of refugees into our society
4851917 its incredibly important that we help rcos develop skills and capacity
4851918 the only place to start is with the grassroots and i hope the basis project will be able to do that

4851922 its a dense hypnotic world part experimental part dub all encompassing
4851923 koshowko take things down into treacherous broken rhythms on the expansive promise slightly eerie vocoders tracing a path through echoing scattershot dub drums and brooding spy movie synths providing one of this compilations most storming and sinister digitally assisted beat breakdowns

4851926 the bush administration has consistently opposed providing funding for international birth control programs but until now has not tried to limit the use of contraceptives inside the united states that could change in the presidents final months in office health and human services officials are considering a draft regulation that would classify most birth control pills the plan b emergency contraceptive and intrauterine devices as forms of abortion because they prevent the development of fertilized eggs into fetuses the rule which does not require congressional approval would allow health care workers who object to abortion on moral or religious grounds to refuse to counsel women on their birth control options or supply contraceptives it would forbid more than half a million health agencies nationwide that receive federal funds from requiring employees to provide such services pharmacists could use the rule as a justification for refusing to fill birth control prescriptions and insurance companies could cite it as a basis for declining to cover the costs

4851930 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4851931 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali

4851953 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4851954 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4851955 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4851956 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4851957 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4851958 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well

4852103 once upon a time along dark time ago there was a tribe of writers in the american south terribly misnamed the new critics they paid inordinate attention to the forms of literary works and to special devices like irony and paradox for an unconscionable time they dominated the reading scene but when the sixties finally arrived thank god the new critics were exposed for their literary exclusiveness and political conservatism the air was cleared and adventurous young critics began to turn to continental europe for inspiration to existentialism and phenomenology to the philosophy of consciousness and reception theory to critical philosophy to structuralism these critics gestured in the right direction but they had to wait for the advent of poststructuralism to discover the full possibilities of their deconstructive art deconstruction alas soon became tedious hollow disengaged feminist et hnic posteolonial and cultural studies came to the rescue saving deconstruction from its innate sterility and enriching their own socio political agenda yes thats the word with all kinds of subtle demystifications and demythifications it may be safely said that with the current prevalence of cultural studies in their varied forms criticism has reached its apogee it only remains for us to stand our ground against sundry humanists reactionaries counter revolutionaries and proto fascists still skulking in the corridors of academe

4852176 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4852177 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4852178 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4852179 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4852180 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4852181 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4852182 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4852183 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4852186 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4852187 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4852188 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4852189 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4852190 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4852191 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4852192 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4852193 the whole point of calculating the portfolio twr is to remove the effect of cash flows on performance thereby making a comparison to a benchmark relevent the benchmark returns do not have any cash flows associated with them and neither does the portfolios twr so its an apples to apples comparison

4852231 the israeli prime minister has a lot more influence over the foreign policy of the united states in the middle east than he has in his own country
4852232 the israelis control the policy in the congress and the senate somewhere around 80 percent of the senate of the united states is completely in support of israel of anything israel wants
4852233 we have exhausted our requests president clinton has answered all our needs there has been no american president in history like president clinton in his support of israel and the jewish people
4852234 president clinton behaves like an obedient child of israel and does
4852235 i am aware how almost impossible it is in this country to carry out a foreign policy in the middle east not approved by the jews former secretary of state george marshall and former defense secretary james forrestral learned that
4852236 terrific control the jews have over the news media and the barrage the jews have built up on congressmen i am very much concerned over the fact that the jewish influence here is completely dominating the scene and making it almost impossible to get congress to do anything they dont approve of the israeli embassy is practically dictating to the congress through influential jewish people in the country

4852440 the best thing about the practice is i thought eric richards kicked the ball extremely well and jamayel smith handled the ball
4852441 thats a young one we really thought was going to have a chance to help us unfortunately he had a serious injury so hes done for the season

4852443 tonight scandal hits the department of justice turns out ashcroft was lip synching let the eagle soar while it was sung by a less attractive attorney general
4852444 then will offshore drilling solve the energy crisis or should we wait for global warming to make everything offshore
4852445 and my guest tonight is dick meyer author of the book why we hate us if by us he means him and by we he means me ive got the answer

4852447 im an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all the assistance that i can get
4852448 pesimismo malhumor sensaci n de infelicidad y preocupaci n constante y cierta dificultad para el contacto social a la que los estudiosos dieron en llamar personalidad tipo d
4852449 la personalidad tipo d representa un importante factor de riesgo que los cardi logos deber n tener en cuenta en sus pacientes sobre todo para las enfermedades cr nicas a diferencia de la depresi n que supone otro tipo de riesgo
4852450 es m s propenso a contraer afecciones cr nicas del aparato circulatorio
4852451 la prevalencia de esta caracter stica de la personalidad en la poblaci n general va del 13 al 24 seg n cada uno de los estudios por eso es significativo que entre las personas con cardiopat as isqu micas haya habido de un 25 a un 36 de pacientes tipo d
4852452 adem s de ser una relativa falencia para implementar estrategias m s adecuadas para regular las emociones el incremento de la vulnerabilidad por este estr s interpersonal es por s mismo una caracter stica promotora de enfermedades
4852453 im living the dream said fricke who is tied for second with
4852454 i was extremely frustrated early in the season he said
4852455 but i started doing so many things well over the last few weeks hitting it good chipping it good and putting it good that i couldnt get frustrated if you do you can lose it all so i decided to stay patient
4852456 ive taught a lot of pros including some who have won tournaments on the pga tour paton said saturday afternoon
4852457 it seems like each one of them invariably will fall into a black hole with their game at some time or another so far jonathan has yet to slip through that kind of crack
4852458 hes the most positive person i know everybody around this club loves him i just walked through the mens grill and all seven of our plasma tvs were on golf channel when the members saw me they started chanting fricke fricke fricke his attitude always has been i know i can do it
4852459 i figured jonathan was making some bad decisions out there so i wanted to walk the course with him and see if i could get him going the right way paton said
4852460 theres no need to come up here for you to tell me good swing
4852461 i made just about everything i looked at he said
4852462 at first i found that a little unnerving he said
4852463 it takes time to realize you have to have trust said fricke who remembers having a golf club in his hand a cut down 3 iron ever since he could walk
4852464 if i hadnt made that one id still be on the tar heel tour he said
4852465 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4852466 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4852467 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4852468 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4852469 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4852470 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4852471 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4852472 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4852473 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4852474 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4852475 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4852476 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4852477 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4852478 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4852479 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4852480 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4852481 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4852482 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4852483 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4852484 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4852485 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4852486 zo we rijden nu al een flinke tijd en je hebt mij niet meer nodig we gaan deze les nog n keer bekijken hoe alles gaat en als je daar zonder kleerscheuren uitkomt heb je wat mij betreft je rijbewijs
4852487 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4852488 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4852489 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4852490 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4852491 this is a planning took where all things are going
4852492 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4852493 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4852494 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4852495 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4852496 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4852497 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4852498 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4852499 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4852500 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4852501 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4852502 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4852503 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4852504 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4852505 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4852506 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4852507 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4852508 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4852509 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4852510 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4852511 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4852512 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4852513 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4852514 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4852515 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4852516 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4852517 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4852518 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4852519 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4852520 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4852521 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4852522 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4852523 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4852524 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4852525 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4852526 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4852527 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4852528 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4852529 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4852530 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4852531 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4852532 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4852533 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4852534 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4852535 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4852536 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4852537 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4852538 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4852539 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4852540 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4852541 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4852542 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4852543 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4852544 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4852545 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4852546 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4852547 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4852548 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4852549 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4852550 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4852551 der trainer redet sehr viel mit mir und schenkt mir das vertrauen das ich brauche
4852552 ich habe vor der saison gesagt ich schei e auf die tore und auf einmal treffe ich
4852553 der druck ist nicht mehr da ich kann nun locker spielen
4852554 wenn ich jetzt nicht den durchbruch schaffe werde ich den verein verlassen
4852555 wir haben einfach im abwehrbereich fehler gemacht die wir nicht machen d rfen
4852556 die mannschaft hat sehr sehr viel investiert und fu ballerisch absolut berzeugt ich habe viele positive dinge gesehen
4852557 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4852558 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4852559 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4852560 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4852561 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4852562 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4852563 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4852564 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4852565 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4852566 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4852567 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4852568 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4852569 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4852570 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4852571 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4852572 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4852573 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4852574 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4852575 says things i dont agree with in a non fawning tone of voice
4852576 i am still getting the same rhetoric that i was getting two years ago
4852577 it doesnt take sherlock holmes to figure it out this whole thing stinks
4852578 a few have now been put off buying in cyprus when they heard what happened to me
4852579 im not going to stay quiet any more and watch other people lose their savings im sleeping in a tent thats what i got for my 75 000 ive lost my home but im not moving from here until i let everyone know what a corrupt society cyprus is
4852580 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
4852581 i am still getting the same rhetoric that i was getting two years ago
4852582 it doesnt take sherlock holmes to figure it out this whole thing stinks
4852583 a few have now been put off buying in cyprus when they heard what happened to me
4852584 im not going to stay quiet any more and watch other people lose their savings im sleeping in a tent thats what i got for my 75 000 ive lost my home but im not moving from here until i let everyone know what a corrupt society cyprus is
4852585 if you want to complain im not the complaint department
4852586 i like it salt i like it wet like my makeup in a mess
4852587 why would the city care about a company from seattle thats going to leave when they lose a few quarters and leave an empty building just sitting there
4852588 the national chains have a lot of money behind them
4852589 whether its a large corporation or not a closed door is a closed door
4852590 one hundred percent of profits go to the corporate where as local shop owners live in madison and spend money here another incentive to support your local guy
4852591 chief justice beverley mclachlin defended her role saturday in the controversial appointment of henry morgentaler to the order of canada shedding light on the secret process that awarded the abortion rights doctor the prestigious distinction
4852592 ms mclachlin also disputed news reports that it was unusual for the advisory council to vote on a candidate and the group usually reaches a decision unanimously
4852593 they use me only for switching trains in the yard i have never been over the mountain
4852594 we think that the competitive threat to paypal may be much more serious this time around given amazons e commerce expertise for more than a decade
4852595 amazons customer base is roughly 80 million consumers the bulk of which enjoy a highly trusted relationship with the company around payments
4852596 we visited each floor each floor has something different for each of the kids

4852600 my men or more then just a group their a family
4852601 extortion racketeering blackmail these are the tools of the mobster without them my reputation on the streets is worth nothing
4852602 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4852603 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4852604 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4852605 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4852606 i think derrick is looking down hed be very proud of his mcrh family doing something very good for the community
4852607 i came to administration last year with this idea and they took a chance on me last year we raised 10 000 this year were a bigger and better event and were looking to improve on that every year also
4852608 possibly in the future as these children are 18 and older going on wed like to turn it into a scholarship whether someone wants to go to nursing school or maybe into police work since eric was with the police officers so this is something were committed to
4852609 he and i used to ride in fact he taught me how to ride and weve taken several trips from virginia to alabama and florida and back and yeah we loved it we loved riding together

4852616 medyo alam ko nang lalaki kasi nung gabi palang na yun may sumalubong na agad sa aking tv crew ng startalk paglabas ko tinanong ako tungkol dun sabi ko nga ah mayroon isyu ba sabi ko sa pagkakaalam ko wala akong ginawang kasalanan unless na may ginawa ako talaga yun at kailangan kong mag sorry sa kanya
4852617 pumasok ako at pagpasok ko pa lang nilapitan ko agad si jenny tapos sabi ko may issue ka raw sa akin ang lakas ng loob ko nun kasi alam ko wala akong ginawang masama sa kanya
4852618 tinanong ko siya kung bakit sabi niya kasi raw i said ganito ganun ang reaction daw niya kay elise dra vicki belos secretary elise angel is coming daw kaya i cant sit there sabi ko what i cant remember that i said that na ginawa ko yun wala talaga akong matandaan but anyway kung na offend ka even if i didnt mean anything im really really sorry sabi niya okay but be careful next time after that umalis na ako
4852619 siguro nabigyan niya ng ibang meaning at malamang nga kasi paglabas ko nilapitan agad ako ng startalk in interview agad ako na kesyo tinarayan ko raw si jenny gulat na gulat talaga ako ah ginawa ko ba yun ang sinabi ko lang kasama ko sina angel and piolo but i didnt mean anything hindi para di siya paupuin i just said the truth
4852620 after nung ma interview ako ng startalk nilapitan ko naman agad siya para mag sorry kung may problema pa siya at least alam ko unang una kahit alam ko na wala akong kasalanan dahil wala namang akong ginawang masama sa kanya nag sorry pa rin ako dahil na offend pala siya sa akin tapos na yun at least i did my part alam ko malinis ang konsensiya ko lalabas at lalabas ang truth
4852621 its a great night to be in washington with you one last time
4852622 as successful as the heartbreakers have been part of me thinks we have also been taken for granted to a degree maybe thats because we have always been consistent we dont really make bad records though some people might like some more than others and we have never really done a bad show so i think in a way maybe weve been taken for granted
4852623 did you see me do it do you have it on camera
4852624 well god was watching and he saw the whole thing
4852625 nightmare on elm street and while this is prolly a bad idea in the first place

4852629 non la prima volta n lultima che soffrirai per amore
4852630 but especially in the second half i thought our tactical kicking really stepped up and we just kept making them come out of their own 22 which is tough
4852631 theres a big improvement there and its become a big part of our game and one of the reasons that got us home in the end
4852632 weve been working on guys looking for space and communicating it the champion that dan is you cant rely on him to make all the calls and i think hes now got some good help around him
4852633 they showed tremendous courage and i think thats what won the game
4852634 their courage and their fitness in the last 20 minutes as a coach you feel very proud they had that togetherness
4852635 defence really set the attitude for us and when you make gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get turnovers at the breakdown
4852636 with 15 to go you could feel we were getting on top of them
4852637 we were playing the right part of the field and putting them under pressure in their own half so you could feel the momentum swing our way
4852638 qu rayos significaba eso ahora que no hay nada colateral y el centro est destrozado
4852639 estoy cansado o no estoy de humor o invent uno de esos maravillosos cuentos que invento cuando no puedo ser honesto y decir no sin que me duela o sin que suene desatento y entonces hoy me fui directo a casa a prepararme algo de comer y a descansar y a escribir estos pensamientos en mi vieja libreta de apuntes que siempre me ayuda a sacar aquello que no puedo sacar de manera ordinaria puntos suspensivos inhala humo exhala humo

4852652 a large contingent of georgia army national guard soldiers flew to the republic of georgia on sunday for joint military exercises at a time when tension is brewing in the region
4852653 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
4852654 it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
4852655 how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
4852656 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
4852657 what you think is reality is no more than scary shadows thrown against the only wall you let yourself see
4852658 you just died aand youre thinking about some other guy who died whenever
4852659 i died i killed myself so i wouldnt have to hear you harassing me anymore

4852696 she sang loudly and stuck her tongue out at him crazily
4852697 ive no use for the things youre currently imagining within those heads of yours
4852698 getting it all out of them down there in the trenches so they can do no more harm below
4852699 she continued spreading both hands over her head towards the crows
4852700 we are here with you you you are not the anannke
4852701 whatever the hell this is why are you asking her

4852730 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4852731 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4852732 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4852733 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4852734 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4852740 the benefits of using rias are not however automatic and depend on designing for key interaction and data handling points and changing the development process to include continuous code integration build and testing
4852741 when we ran the analysis we were pleased with by the significant reduction in our own carbon footprint
4852742 the question then became how we could broaden the green impact by expanding the solution from an internal resource into a customizable team space to be used by our entire client base

4852751 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers

4852761 on day 4 of the republican national convention john mccain will be declared the official republican candidate for the presidency he has said that the war is the key issue in his campaign stand with people from around the country to say no to his policies of war we will rally at the state capitol and then march to the xcel center
4852762 in the past the university administration has let students go for caucusing and voting
4852763 were making the case that students are acting out a different form of commitment to civic studies
4852764 even the humphrey institute which is usually progressive is hosting condoleezza rice and colin powell
4852765 theyre opening their doors to the republicans this is a campus that weve put way too much tuition into and that the state has put way too much money into to justify that
4852766 the economy is in the shitter were still pouring money into this war and we have a really direct target that we can voice that opposition to
4852767 people will hopefully be able to see what it means to stand up for what you believe in again
4852768 walkouts are an incredibly important protest when a large number of students choose to leave
4852769 i think its powerful to see people most of whom cant even vote yet using their voice and sacrificing something so that they can go and make their voices heard
4852770 all day those two days were going to be handing out flyers about the walkout to every person we see
4852771 weve done massive neighborhood outreach in last week and half
4852772 our numbers are on track its been really energizing to see how much community and student support weve gotten
4852773 were excited by the opportunity to right off the bat make mac a political space

4852776 there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps said cornel marculescu of switzerland the executive director of swimmings international federation
4852777 its almost too close to see one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool

4852779 thus mr graham has no information setting forth what alleged expenses were reimbursed whether those alleged expenses were legitimate or the dates that payments were made to the informants
4852780 the dates are likely to correspond with payments made to the informant and the release of information from chapman to the fbi
4852781 the government and fbi should not be able to hide the name of a witness who says he or she saw aquash alive months after she was allegedly killed

4852784 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
4852785 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4852786 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4852787 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4852788 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4852789 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4852790 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4852791 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
4852792 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
4852793 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4852794 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4852795 we dont know what their association was or what their dispute might have been but it is clear based on witness accounts that the suspect did intend to harm the victim and did not intend to harm other people there

4852814 were going to explore the background of the fallen the main villain of the movie as well as expand on the reign of starscream story that were doing and tie everything in to what this next movie is going to be
4852815 the next movie starts out with just tons of action and theres obviously going to be a lot of questions so were hoping to answer some of those beforehand
4852816 were definitely taking every character that we can from the sequel
4852817 so youll see some sector 7 involvement and how they developed into a new group that will be introduced
4852818 ive never really had the chance to lay down the definitive story around the 13 and what role they played in what came after them over the years for various publishers in various publications ive laid seeds of this group called the 13 and hinted about who some of them might be and how they play into the bigger mythos i think this is where were finding answers to all the big questions were working very closely with hasbro in this series so that whatever we do in the 13 is very much tied in to the whole transformers universe they want to get all of their irons in the fire ready and in the right order for 2009 which is the 25th anniversary were all working hopefully to get a definitive cohesive transformers universe in terms of the back story
4852819 the 13 will eventually payoff in current series and plots and possibly elsewhere within the transformers family of media
4852820 its interesting that the second movie is using this character called the fallen which is a character that we created back in the dreamwave days for this big series called the dark ages which tapped into what had gone before so these names and institutions like the 13 are rolling on into different incarnations
4852821 see what i would have to become to stop men like him
4852822 youve changed everything there is no going back in that the mafia would have to be different than they were before which would be perfect for the black mask
4852823 he is an exceptionally smart perceptive guy who has purposefully risen to and overcome so many challenges
4852824 the noise and hurly burly of the trading floor make the physicality of trading more difficult for someone in kierans position but the challenge actually appeals to him
4852825 our time together at goldman was the essential inspiration and catalyst for my decision to go into medicine
4852826 in my small attempts at helping you you helped me more than i could imagine i wouldnt be doing this without you
4852827 helping kieran really reminded me of what i was missing and of the values my parents had instilled in me
4852828 if anyone asked me why i wanted to become a doctor i just explained about my relationship with kieran
4852829 i didnt even know how i just felt really grateful because getting that letter was amazing
4852830 i dont have very many memorable trading stories yet because i am still not senior enough to be put on big positions but the letter made me realise that i had actually touched an individuals soul
4852831 i set off up the road to fetch kieran and there he was sitting in the middle of the field in his chair
4852832 it was getting dark but he wasnt crying i asked him why he hadnt called out to anyone and he said he knew someone would come for him eventually
4852833 the ability to move about the house on my own was unbelievable it was like climbing everest and going down to the garden gate being able to look out amazing
4852834 he could finally join in instead of being left behind
4852835 i could have stayed in manchester because it was easier to live at home but i thought basically lets go for it i knew i could pretty much do anything i wanted intellectually and i thought to use a football metaphor why not go out and try to play for real madrid
4852836 i expected kieran to be very quantitative reserved and geeky given the supercomputer between his ears but he was just the opposite
4852837 i think the macho part of that the idea of working on a mental battlefield appealed to kieran as much as the need for pure brainpower
4852838 he also has a great memory and can think laterally he recognises patterns and makes connections that other people fail to see
4852839 first of all kierans sheer raw talent is impressive and when you add to that the determination he shows getting through the day in a place like goldman sachs which is so demanding it is just breath taking
4852840 but these markets are the most difficult ive ever seen so im just using this period of volatility to learn as much as i can
4852841 i think john was somewhat horrified because he insisted on giving me the money for a new chair
4852842 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen
4852843 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4852844 i am not allowed to make a change that breaks the system
4852845 however long you think something will take it will take longer than that by a factor of pi

4852850 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4852851 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain

4852853 the basic agreements do not determine the ceiling for the peacekeeping contingents
4852854 how long it will take i have already emphasized that it depends not only on us we are constantly facing problems created by the georgian side

4852856 why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore we are hard at work
4852857 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4852858 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4852859 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4852860 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4852861 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4852862 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4852863 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4852864 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4852865 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4852866 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4852867 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4852868 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4852869 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4852870 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable

4852915 ketentuan bebas bayar fiskal bagi yang punya npwp mulai 1 januari 2009 dan diharapkan mulai 1 januari 2011 tidak ada lagi fiskal kita pakai waktu 2 tahun untuk membuat orang mempunyai npwp
4852916 karena banyak pengecualian maka dalam praktik menjadi sulit untuk dilaksanakan sehingga melalui ruu pph diubah konsepsinya di mana kalau sudah punya npwp tidak perlu lagi membayar fiskal
4852917 jadi istri boleh menggunakan npwp milik suami anak di bawah umur 21 tahun boleh memakai npwp bapaknya kalau sudah lebih 21 tahun harus punya npwp kalau tidak dia harus bayar fiskal kecuali dia bisa membuktikan bahwa dia masih menjadi tanggungan orang tua misalnya dengan kartu keluarga

4852960 the deserted women will be given financial assistance of 1 000 for seeking legal help and will also be offered counselling
4852961 if we get a large number of such cases where women are abandoned after the two year deadline we will review the time limit
4852962 in many cases men claim they hold fantastic jobs abroad but when the wife goes she realises that he is either out of work or does some odd jobs
4852963 in these cases nris come to india for a holiday get married pocket the dowry and then disappear without leaving a trace
4852964 because in their greed to send their daughters abroad most parents dont do enough verification there is very little awareness about these problems
4852965 because there are extra territorial boundaries involved most women are left in the lurch when their nri husbands run away there is no legal way to get them back
4852966 the police are often reluctant to file a case and even if they do and the court issues a summons how do you deliver the summons on foreign territory the court can order confiscation of property but what about those nris who do not own property in india
4852967 domestic violence or matrimonial offences at present are not extraditable offences we need to address that
4852968 did the maoists promise to protect u in the future
4852969 nepali people will not die without information provided by kantipur newspapers we do not need its information we do not need its journalists either
4852970 the partys public statement that the peoples right to information wont be affected even if kantipur publications is closed down is extremely regrettable
4852971 we are stunned by the remarks of maoist lawmaker and chairman of all nepal trade union federation salik ram jamkattel who on monday afternoon gathered his party cadres in ycl attire in front of kantipur complex and openly threatened to abduct and physically assault the publications management officials and journalists categorically mentioning their names
4852972 while there is debate on a precise definition of civil society most
4852973 the most visible and most vocal of the lot from nepali civil society
4852974 their collective thinking is characterized by a venal disdain or
4852975 so jail time during jana andolan became a revolving door to wear as a
4852976 they parrot what their masters believe and have never come across as principled fighters for stable government for stable government requires force that causes pain on a certain segment of the population democratic societies have always been tested in maintaining order while also having to follow the rule of law

4852980 i warned you to watch out now well have to go up there and apologize and see how much that lousy drive is going to cost us
4852981 oh no apology is necessary actually i want to thank you you see im a genie and ive been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years now that youve released me im allowed to grant three wishes ill give you each one wish and ill keep the last one for myself

4852993 if you want to become a volunteer visit our exhibition at basantapur on 5th december at 11 30
4852994 we have the fifty year long history of organizing and managing multiparty elections in nepal and here some rookie foreigners who have hardly participated in the election process in their country come as election experts and lecture us how to conduct an election
4852995 they dont know how things work in nepal and this has become a learning experience for them rather than us benefiting from their presence
4852996 when you volunteer that gives an idea about the person whether s he is committed towards to job or not
4852997 yes most of these volunteers would volunteer even if the un didnt even pay a cent
4852998 guys at this site are so sceptical of the un and its affiliates
4852999 and yes for any young person whether he she is planning to join the corporate world or the planning to join an ngo a stint at the un is a huge learning experience and they would grab the opportunity with both hands
4853000 expect these voluntary jobs to solve even a part of the unemployment problem in nepal
4853001 look i have served in nepal the country of mount everest
4853002 what the un wants to pay for its staffs and how many staff they want to hire is something that they decide using their own criteria
4853003 look at the un as a source of employment its job is not this
4853004 the main reason i have reacted so strongly is that people who write this post seems to be so ignorent about what the un actually does its limited authority and the condition in which it works
4853005 what if the un suddenly decides that it dosent care what happens to nepal what then
4853006 there are about 249 unvs working in nepal out of which 44 are nationals and 205 are international
4853007 un volunteer system provides excellent on the job experience to people without prior experience
4853008 a stipend to cover for their living and food expenses
4853009 nepal may not be a high risk environment like darfur or afghanistan but unv are also expected to post at very high risk situations risking their security
4853010 if an interpreter is paid 40 000rs a month in nepal by the un system believe me its much lesser than what an official interpreter should be paid in many other countries
4853011 also un salaries are adjusted according to duty stations a person serving un in new york will definitely earn more than one in katmandu
4853012 also how many people in nepal do you know who are advanced degree holders in any of the official languages of the un
4853013 also i think it is ridiculous to compare the salary of a highly skilled interpreter to average salary in nepal
4853014 interpreter is not paid by nepalese govt he she is paid by the un system
4853015 and finally to you and the author of this blog if you are doubtful that the volunteers will not work if they are not paid any salaries
4853016 instead of appreciating that the un system provides reasonable salary to volunteers you are actually criticizing them
4853017 un internship programme doesnt pay a cent to its interns who work hard to gain useful experience
4853018 without party being in the power and without having enough money we can not win the election
4853019 who are we to comment on other countries offer when we cant figure out our own mess
4853020 the maoists shot sah dead the day after he was abducted
4853021 they the maoist cadres asked the journalist duo to follow them to cover news of timber smugglers whom they claimed they had caught red handed

4853031 everybody is equal but somebody is more equal than another
4853032 people in madhes want their separate administration legislature and a separate judiciary to settle their disputes but their demands have been rejected so far
4853033 in essence the madhesi people want to end the present colonial relationship between kathmandu and the tarai
4853034 the government would announce a new date for the elections within a day or two
4853035 they keep on adding demands that they think the nc cannot fulfill
4853036 possibly it will be 55 45 as the communist partners are ready for a 60 40 ratio
4853037 in 1999 there were 40 armed conflicts being fought within the territories of 36 countries up from 36 armed conflicts in 31 countries in 1998 and 37 in 32 countries in 1997 4
4853038 dont you think the future president of this country who might be elected from anyone of us has more exposure to reality and experience of poverty hunger hours of time waste in traffic jam getting pushed in bus and so on while crown price has not a single moment resembling the ordinary nepali life
4853039 it is the argument on who is better between kings and elected figure
4853040 can we not agree that the maoists have a good reason to believe very little of the past agreements with them will be honored if they dont win a good deal of support in the ca elections
4853041 mero 22 points pura garne bhae gar natra ma roe dinchhu
4853042 i have worked during conflict in maoist influenced area and i know how much people support them its totally different than wot comes in media actually people love maoist but still people hasitate to tell it coz country gone through long war of decade
4853043 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life

4853049 ibu diminta ke sana sekarang ia terus menayakan ibu barangkali ia sakit rindu
4853050 rindu sejak kapan ia merindukanku sayang sekali sepagi ini aku menanak nasi dan belum juga matang dan air yang aku jerang belum juga mendidih kukira ia akan segera sembuh
4853051 saya ke sini hanya disuruh saja saya hanya bisa berharap ibu bisa datang ke sana kalau ibu tak mau tugas saya telah sudah kutunaikan saya telah memberitahu ibu bahwa abdurahman sakit saya tak disuruh untuk memaksa ibu
4853052 kalau kau mau pergi pergilah bawa apa yang kamu bisa bawa sedikitpun aku tak mencegahmu sudah biasa saya hidup sendiri toh ibu sudah tua dan mungkin sudah tak lama lagi
4853053 kalau ingin aku pergi ya diam ini rumah rumahku kalau aku jual dan aku pindah itu urusanku
4853054 baik pergilah tapi ingat bahwa aku pun ikut berjuang atas rumah ini saya bertahun di jakarta jadi babu untuk membeli pekarangan rumah ini
4853055 bukan seperti itu mestinya kau tahu aku punya hak atas rumah ini mestinya kau dengarkan aku rumah ini jangan kau jual itu juga hakku untuk melarangmu menjual rumah ini
4853056 seenaknya mengatur ngatur memangnya aku ini siapa kalau memang kau tak sudi lagi tidak mengapa bilang saja kau tak suka badan hanya satu tidak denganmu pun ku yakin masih bisa hidup semua ini allah melihat
4853057 aku tak mengatakan seperti yang ia katakan ia saja yang manja
4853058 apa sesenaknya apa kalau ia keliru tidak boleh diperingatkan apa aku akan membelanya juga menyesal aku membolehkan kau ambil dia
4853059 itulah dia semakin parah dan sejak saya pulang dari sini pagi tadi ia tidak bisa berbicara lagi lidahnya kelu ia hanya bisa merintih
4853060 maaf apakah dia bersalah padaku aku rasa tidak ada apa apa di antara kita
4853061 kukira sudah cukup tak ada yang diteruskan sayang sekali saya harus menyelesaikan tikar hari ini agar besok pagi bisa saya bawa ke pasar bilang saja saya tak ada waktu
4853062 saat dia masih bisa bicara ia bilang ingin sekali beretemu dengan ibu apa ibu tidak merasa kasihan padanya
4853063 kasihan tahu apa sampeyan sampeyan laki laki tak pernah merasakan apa yang kaua rsakan sudah jelas kan
4853064 saya tidak tahu mengapa dia sakit dokter yang memeriksa tidak pernah tahu dia sakit apa
4853065 untuk apa bukankah dia telah mati dan apakah kalau aku ke sana ia akan bangun lagi tidak di sana saya tidak akan bertemu siapa siapa
4853066 dulu aku punya suami sekarang tidak dulu akau punya anak dan menantu sekarang tidak apakah sampeyan tidak tahu aku sendirian saja di rumah ini tidak ada siap siapa
4853067 bilang saja saya tidak akan ke sana kalau hanya untuk melihat jenazah saja dulu ia anakku sekarang tidak lagi dulu ia rumah tempat aku pulang rindu sekarang aku tinggal di sini sendiri dulu tempat ia menabung sekarang aku bekerja sendiri menganyam tikar andai hati ini seperti tungku maka telah menguaplah semua air mata ini kering untuk apa tangis
4853068 saya tidak marah barangkali saya terlarut emosi aku beristigfar atas dosa dosaku ini
4853069 tidak sebisa mungkin aku telah berdoa sesuai nama pemberianku itu tapi allah bekehendak lain dan aku tak rela kepadanya barangkali ia punya surga yang lain
4853070 bukan tetapi ada yang perlu diluruskan dalam langkah yang telah kita ambil
4853071 apakah kau sudah tidak memetik gitar lagi barangkali satu lagu bisa kita mainkan bersama untuk mengusir jemu ini
4853072 untuk apa kita tak punya banyak waktu kali ini harus dipersingkat saja sebelum ada yang terjebak pada situasi yang tak diinginkan kita harus segera bergegeas
4853073 kita punya tempat masing masing dan kita tak disatukan dalam satu tempat yang sama karena kita belum
4853074 kita belum pernah menyatakan ikrar untuk keabsahan kita hidup bersama
4853075 dalam kependekan waktu ini kita harus menerangjernihkan kabut dalam perjalanan ini
4853076 dua buah rumah yang akan kita singgahi dalam perjalanan ini
4853077 ajaklah aku masuk dalam sebuah rumah yang indah itu bersamamu
4853078 apakah kau hanya ingin mengatakan bahwa aku membosankan bagimu apakah kau telah memiliki seorang pengganti apakah kau hanya ingin bilang hubungan kita berakhir saja
4853079 sebenarnya bukan kemustahilan tapi memang ada syarat yang telah tak dipenuhi kalau kita menikah nanti hubungan kita saat ini tetap tak pernah kita penuhi kosong dan sekarang ini kita telah membiarkannya itu terjadi ini menjadi semacam tanda yang tak pernah bisa kita bela keberadaannya karena lagi lagi kita tak pernah punya hujah
4853080 barangkali kau tak terlalu faham tapi maafkanlah karena aku tak bisa memahamkan hal ini aku berharap suatu saat nanti entah kapan kau akan tahu tentang titik koordinat kita yang sebenarnya saat ini ini cerita pertama tentang rumah yang tak bisa kita bangun
4853081 seperti sebuah rumah dengan aksen tropis dan negeri musim semi sekaligus
4853082 kalau kita tak mengingkari kendali itu mestinya kita tak di sini saat ini saat lalu dan saat depan karena telah tercemar saat ini tak boleh hadir saat saat itu
4853083 kalau akhirnya kau hanya ingin mengatakan kita putus ini sangat menyakitkan
4853084 tidak bahkan tuhan melarang kita memutuskan tali yang telah tuhan sambungkan tapi kita memang harus menyudahi sandiwara ini
4853085 kau hanya menganggap ini hanya sandiwara padahal aku anggap ini serius bukan sandiwara
4853086 adanya anggapan itulah yang menyebabkan kita benar benar sedang bersandiwara jadi ini bukan keseriusan karena baru anggapan

4853108 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4853120 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be an important part of its success
4853121 you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happens is that token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
4853122 ive been raised in a very liberal bohemian family in which religion has not played any part at all for me being a muslim really was about urdu about eating biryani and wearing shararas on id so the cultural aspect of me was muslim otherwise because i am not religious the religion did not matter after the riots following the babri masjid demolition i suddenly had people saying you are a muslim and hurling it as an accusation it was a self consciousness that i have never before experienced what it made me do is say yes i am muslim and what do you want to do about it that i can say is increasingly happening particularly in the western world a lot of young kids today are wearing the burqa are taking on an identity which really they dont feel just because when you push somebody against the wall thats what they come up with
4853123 a leader for muslims and thats the way it should be

4853296 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4853297 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4853298 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one

4853301 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4853302 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4853303 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4853304 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong

4853311 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did

4853317 the parents of these children believe in these men so completely that when they hand over their sons they relinquish all control
4853318 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say that whatever happens to their son is for the childs good
4853319 my grandson can say whatever he wants but i know the truth

4853329 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4853330 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives

4853454 gods plan is dedicated to the unification of all races religions and creeds
4853455 looking back into history we can easily see that the guiding hand of providence has chosen the nordic people to bring in and unfold the new order of the world
4853456 records clearly show that 95 of the colonists were nordics anglo saxons providence has chosen the nordics because the nordics have prepared themselves and have chosen god
4853457 the nordics are gods chosen people always looking for more light on the mission of life just as providence has chosen the jewish race the children of israel to bring into the world righteousness by carrying the ten commandments which emphasize remember the sabbath day and keep it holy so also providence has chosen the nordic race to unfold the new age of the world a novus ordo seclorum
4853458 one of the first of the nordics to reach the new world was the viking leif erikson he sailed from norway to bring to his people in ireland a new message the message of the christian god but providence moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform and so leif the lucky was sent by providence to the new world from the abundance of grapes found there leif erikson called the place vinland it is easy to sense that leif erikson was sent by the guiding hand of providence to bring the norse spirit of the all father to the shores of the new world
4853459 the latins are of the fourth aryan civilization and the american race will be the sixth aryan civilization

4853462 george washington thomas jefferson benjamin franklin john adams thomas paine and many others of the founders of the new nation in the new world were nordics thomas paine the spark plug of the american revolution loved god but hated sectarianism in these are the times he wrote
4853463 we have it in our power to begin the world all over again
4853464 as stated before gods plan in america is a non sectarian plan
4853465 our great american public schools have never taken away from any child the freedom of will freedom of spirit or freedom of mind that is the divine reason that great god our king has chosen the great american public schools to pave the way for the new race the new religion and the new civilization that is taking place in america
4853466 any mother father or guardian who is responsible for the taking away of freedom of mind freedom of will or freedom of spirit is the lowest criminal on earth because they take away from that child the god given right to become a part of gods great plan in america for the dawn of the new age of the world
4853467 well see i didnt know that okay ill scratch the ticket you can go

4853470 this is not an isolated idiosyncratic event the way the losses from the september 11 2001 terrorist attack were this is a structural sector wide downsizing stemming from business errors

4853493 i knew hank too well and i know he wouldnt have done that to you or your mother or your brother
4853494 i know that some believe he was drunk and drove into the river on purpose but thats just not true hank had his rough patches just like everyone else but he was not a quitter especially not when it came to family
4853495 im sorry sweetheart someone maybe should have told you more but you were so young when it happened we all just wanted to make things easier for you and not burden you with all of the details
4853496 it was just too much for a young girl to handle at the time and its been so many years since
4853497 i can tell you the autopsy showed he had had a beer or two that night but not enough to make him drunk ive always thought that he must have met a deer on that stretch of river road and swerved to miss it and his front tire caught the gravel and he just lost control i know thats what must have happened hank might have been going too fast in a hurry i suppose to get home and that could have contributed
4853498 i know your mother has had a hard time talking to you and edgar about the accident but you have to understand hanks death nearly killed her i dont think marjie ever really recovered
4853499 he didnt suffer there was no water in his lungs

4853532 coffee is the common mans gold and like gold it brings to every man the feeling of luxury and nobility take time in your preparation of coffee and god will be with you and bless you and your table where coffee is served there is grace and splendour and friendship and happiness all cares vanish as the coffee cup is raised to the lips coffee flows through your body as freely as your lifes blood refreshing all that it touches look you at the youth and vigour of those who drink it
4853533 coffee is real good when you drink it it gives you time to think
4853534 it is inhumane in my opinion to force people who have a genuine medical need for coffee to wait in line behind people who apparently view it as some kind of recreational activity i bet this kind of thing does not happen to heroin addicts i bet that when serious heroin addicts go to purchase their heroin they do not tolerate waiting in line while some dilettante in front of them orders a hazelnut smack a cino with cinnamon sprinkles
4853535 i believe that the american coffee industry is doing itself irreparable harm by mass marketing mediocre coffee at a low price

4853539 a review of the companys recent performance and unveiling of the companys five transformational initiatives for 2008 and beyond
4853540 when we went to automatic espresso machines we solved a major problem in terms of speed of service and efficiency at the same time we overlooked the fact that we would remove much of the romance and theatre that was in play with the use of the la marzocca machines this specific decision became even more damaging when the height of the machines which are now in thousands of stores blocked the visual sight line the customer previously had to watch the drink being made and for the intimate experience with the barista
4853541 what exactly is this tall machine blocking the sight of a button being pushed
4853542 one of the results has been stores that no longer have the soul of the past and reflect a chain of stores vs the warm feeling of a neighborhood store some people even call our stores sterile cookie cutter no longer reflecting the passion our partners feel about our coffee

4853558 id like to share a revelation that ive had during my time here it came to me when i tried to classify your species and i realized that you arent actually mammals every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with its surrounding environment but you humans do not you move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed the only way you can survive is to spread to another area there is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern do you know what it is a virus human beings are a disease a cancer of this planet you are a plague and we are the cure
4853559 i do wonder if the us has much of a platform to stand upon

4853561 wait for a revolution and then join in posted by usc1 at 08 15 2008 5 51pm
4853562 the u s needs to get off its high horse realize that we are one nation of many nations and that our way even if we think its the best is not necessarily the way for other nations to proceed

4853566 its a reflection of peoples despair and the fact that people are aware the eyes of the world are on china in the run up to the olympic games so people use this opportunity to vent their frustration with the situation in tibet which has been very very strict over the last 10 years in particular
4853567 obviously we are very afraid that there will be a harsh clampdown on the demonstrators

4853578 the meeting of the sadc countries this weekend offers an important opportunity for african nations to review the talks progress and demonstrate their support for this process i urge them to seize it

4853580 a lot of religious voters are trying to make up their mind about how they vote
4853581 a lot say they have some preference for mccain but a lot of that preference is soft and many are still open
4853582 the candidates faith and how they connect to issues is important to those voters
4853583 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead

4853588 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead

4853635 we continue to believe that there are attractive venture capital investments here in wisconsin and the midwest and are very excited about the opportunities ahead
4853636 the local venture capital environment continues to evolve with the quality of startups in wisconsin and the midwest being some of the best in united states
4853637 bairds new fund is a great opportunity to continue supporting wisconsin venture capital funds and to build on an existing relationship
4853638 the local nature of venture capital investments and the particular strategy of this fund make it clear they will focus on opportunities in wisconsin and the midwest
4853639 baird has generated attractive returns by executing on its focused strategy and has formed a strong investment team of experienced venture capital professionals
4853640 the support structure for early start up companies is far better today compared to when we first started investing regionally in 1999
4853641 we feel the future is bright given what has taken place over the past nine years and expect to be able to capitalize on that
4853642 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4853643 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4853644 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4853645 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4853646 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4853647 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4853648 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4853649 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4853650 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4853651 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4853652 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4853653 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4853654 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4853655 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

4853663 nick got a little squeamish when we talked to him about you but in a way that i think was endearing and the story is that the two of you are dating and dont want to talk about it what can you tell us
4853664 well hes an amazing guy ryan anybody would be very lucky to be dating him
4853665 the choice of the name was the first step towards the creation of this concept
4853666 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4853667 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4853668 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4853669 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4853670 the administrations blatant attempt to slide pay raises under the radar by submitting them after the completion of the budget process

4853680 weve seen the press reports youre referring to but these are all matters for the pakistani political system and for the pakistanis to deal with
4853681 the instability is of course causing concerns in pakistan but it is also not in the interest of pakistans western allies
4853682 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4853683 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4853684 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4853685 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4853686 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4853687 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4853688 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4853689 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4853690 you feel sick that somebody has been in your home going through your stuff
4853691 arrests have been made under the charges of waging war against the state and also for murder both unbailable offenses
4853692 yeah you know they say that sometimes meditating is better than sleep
4853693 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4853694 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4853695 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4853696 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4853697 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4853698 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4853699 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4853700 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4853701 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4853702 we can give our children two things one is roots the other is wings
4853703 dame nuala oloan says that all protestants not some but all have been brought up to mistrust catholics
4853704 this was the teaching of some churches to their people
4853705 i was told by protestants that they were and i checked it and checked it and checked it
4853706 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman
4853707 im here with my husband and baby and i just want to take a few pictures
4853708 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us it was pretty risky
4853709 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down so we got prepared to stick through another tough night out there
4853710 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm everything was soaking wet
4853711 it was pretty scary i was trying to lead the way the other day and a big slab fell down beside me i was really shitting myself then because its a long way to the bottom
4853712 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking ohhh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break its been like this for days and days
4853713 every time the chopper goes away and looks somewhere else youre thinking come on come on just see us
4853714 we were fine we could have lasted a few more days without too much trouble except for the boredom
4853715 we heard it fly over the back of the ridge as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility it was such a relief to see it waving back to us
4853716 there were times it was kind of scary i have to say but somehow i knew we were going to be all right
4853717 they did the right thing they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4853718 i was inspired by a movie i watched about pilots flying planes and ever since developed interest in becoming a pilot in order to fly planes
4853719 do you believe they work thats 90 of their usefulness
4853720 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
4853721 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
4853722 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them
4853723 18 states that are battlegrounds decided by 2 to 4 points

4853728 de bedreigingen in de column aan het adres van groenlinks politica femke halsema zijn van dien aard dat de pvda amsterdam verdere samenwerking niet wenselijk acht
4853729 ik zou het buitengewoon toejuichen als iemand eventjes buitengewoon integer het woonadres van femke halsema opsnuffelt en die tent buitengewoon integer in de fik steekt dat wijf verdient niet beter

4853732 needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
4853733 he will not get a more fierce fight from a united states senator than he will have from me
4853734 on this issue he couldnt be more wrong nothing is more crucial for colorado than water and i oppose any suggestion that the federal government should get involved in how we share it with arizona california or any other state
4853735 were not talking about short term here his comments are based on his fundamental understanding of the challenges faced by western states
4853736 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
4853737 at a minimum it would pit these basin states against one another in extended negotiations instead of facilitating cooperative efforts to address the significant water supply challenges facing the arid west thats not the kind of leadership we need
4853738 the only way forward to a secure water future is to recognize our supply limits and live within them
4853739 the reality is that all cities that have water shortages have to look at it
4853740 reusing treated water for drinking purposes is definitely part of australias water future
4853741 we are already the driest continent and climate change is making that worse so its very important that australia is one of the first countries to adopt recycled water and recycled water for drinking
4853742 they should be investigating the possibility of using that water to replenish our reservoirs and eventually have it coming out of our taps
4853743 the water compact that colorado and other upper basin states have with california and arizona should be renegotiated
4853744 in a telephone interview with the pueblo chieftain the presumptive gop candidate for president said the water sharing agreement reached in 1922 between seven western states doesnt take into account increases in population and changing water needs
4853745 the colorado river compact allocates 7 5 million acre feet of water to california nevada and arizona anything left over is split between colorado utah new mexico and wyoming
4853746 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 percent reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change in the southwest instead of threatening a diminishing resource it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration
4853747 i heard a lot of avalanches around us i thought im too young to die
4853748 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4853749 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4853750 strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days and fay could be approaching hurricane strength as it nears western cuba
4853751 most of haiti is under heavy rains especially in the south with winds clocked at about 70 kilometers per hour 43 mph
4853752 the man who tells this story is none other than mr norman dodd who in 1954 was the staff director of the congressional special committee to investigate tax exempt foundations sometimes referred to as the reece committee in recognition of its chairman congressman carol reece
4853753 non c molto e permettendomi di copiare la classica frase recitata ogni semestre dalle maestre e poi dai professori fiat
4853754 this is the first time weve run across this type of case
4853755 if i knew it was something i wasnt supposed to sell wouldnt i hide it
4853756 because this is new we want to do whats in the best interest of the city and the business
4853757 the strongest question is how this got into the country
4853758 people in the pub are genuinely interested in what we are up to
4853759 it was famous because of niagara niagara mohawk owned the original niagara falls power station one of the first hydroelectric power stations in the world now long gone mohawk is the tribe of indians from that region the then management felt that that name should stay above the door
4853760 no one in headquarters had any idea who national grid were that stuck with me
4853761 there was a view that national grid had not brought any benefit actually we had brought an extraordinary level of benefit the business had been almost in bankruptcy we improved the finances and we have been working to improve the performance of that business
4853762 the customer didnt understand who owned the business didnt know that there had been a change and as far as employees were concerned they didnt feel that they belonged to one company
4853763 this is a business that is just at the beginning of a huge transformation the decarbonising of our energy the replacement of systems that were built 50 to 80 years ago how do we make sure we build something that lasts for a long time and is fit flexible and robust enough to cope with all the scenarios of the future all that needs big companies that are well financed and have the talent thats where national grid excels
4853764 energy demand was growing so we were not upset about it
4853765 once you have decoupled you dont have the perversity in the system that you want more people to use more power then you can divert your talent financial and intellectual to working on helping people to save energy
4853766 the difficulty now is that energy prices are high are they going to get lower i dont think you would plan on oil going back to 50 a barrel
4853767 we are in a world where energy is more expensive that doesnt mean we shouldnt make sure we have the right infrastructure
4853768 i spend hardly any of my time thinking about it
4853769 is the us still fragmented yes it is might there be opportunities in the future yes there might
4853770 theres plenty of revenue growth and cost cutting in the us and the stock is seen as cheap but not cheap enough for people to pile in the market gives less hope value these days it wants delivery
4853771 when the spirit of the lord touches me i dance like david danced

4853838 there have been some reports lately that solar minimum is lasting longer than it should thats not true the ongoing lull in sunspot number is well within historic norms for the solar cycle
4853839 the sun is now near the low point of its 11 year activity cycle
4853840 we call this solar minimum it is the period of quiet that separates one solar max from another
4853841 obama arrived in iraq on monday for what is described as a fact finding mission however its hard to believe obama is actually searching for facts in iraq nor will the facts he finds change his position the position he chose for himself as well as all the comments he has made so far about iraq reflect a disregard for facts and there is no reason to expect a change now
4853842 i am glad youre following the road show circus that obama is starring in how phony apparently a man who used to work at the white house for a dem administration do not know which one came to the back of the obama plane to answer questions from the press he declined to answer one saying that when he was at the white house they did not answer questions like the one asked a frustrated reporter spoke up and reminded this man that obama is not the president the obama campaign has just assumed that since obama is playing the role of president on this trip that somehow he has already won the election i do not think this will resonate well with a lot of people here a few of the mainstream press are beginning to put some heat on obama including andrea mitchell and katie couric
4853843 it became obvious in 1994 that the anc used race as a way to get control over the judiciary
4853844 it is this hegemonic impulse and compulsion to control and we are seeing the results of that now

4853848 i spent more time campaigning in black areas than in white areas but the dividends were poor whites were the low hanging fruits easy pickings because they were politically available
4853849 but the party should never give up on the quest for black votes every black led opposition party in this country has gone backwards some of it is historic but a reconfiguration needs to take place
4853850 there should be a breakthrough with black voters soon even if it is a modest one the progressive party the das predecessor took 40 years to get through to afrikaans voters
4853851 the anc would have demonised us just the same it was then very difficult for people to take on the anc but now it is easier
4853852 there were no expectations everyone predicted the end of the party that turned out to be our biggest advantage
4853853 i asked madiba what do i do when i disagree he answered i would be listened to but in the end we will face the world as a united front
4853854 if i took this up there would have been no opposition at all
4853855 it was viable for the party but not for the electorate
4853856 it has always been our view that we should support all leaders of the anc i am not sure if people misunderstood that to be for or against a particular anc leader
4853857 cosatus leaders are determined to get him out so that they can access numsas resources
4853858 the signs for this include the fact that the union is losing membership constantly and is being outflanked by solidarity united peoples union of south africa and other unions especially at sasol
4853859 in addition there is no evidence that the union has ideas about how to turn around the industry and support job creation
4853860 while job losses provide an explanation for the decline in membership we must interrogate the other organisational reasons why ceppwawu is losing its foothold in some of its stronghold regions and companies

4853888 i am optimistic that this agreement will be implemented quickly if so it will mark the completion of a process that began in 2001 that has already seen libya take steps forward as a model among nations to renounce terror and weapons of mass destruction

4854003 the admission that obamas mentor was frank marshall davis an identified cpusa member can only add to growing public concern about obamas relationship with a communist pawn of moscow who was the subject of security investigations by the fbi and various congressional committees which examined soviet activities in the u s

4854026 i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors
4854027 at the time coach reid didnt know there were people saying contract didnt want to play anymore and i admit that i created those rumors out of a lot of frustration and i didnt care what people thought
4854028 coach reid allowed me some time after one of the team meetings to address my teammates i just felt like it was something that i needed to slash had to do because of the way that i just disappeared like i said the things i said that conveyed to them that i didnt want to be here anymore or whatever thoughts were in their minds i just wanted to let them know that it wasnt that i was trying to get out of work im no stranger to hard work i just wanted them to know that i hope they still respect me if they dont im going to do everything possible to gain the respect back
4854029 being that im getting help now and im opening up more its definitely been a big weight lifted off of me
4854030 i can stay prayed up about the situation and just know the difference of when i walk onto the field and try to compose myself because ive always felt alone after opening up to a couple people i definitely feel like i better know how to handle the situation

4854032 weve all talked about it and laughed about it and in some cases cried about it and were all starting to relax now

4854074 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4854075 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4854076 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4854077 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4854078 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4854079 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4854080 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4854081 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4854082 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4854083 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4854084 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4854085 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4854086 people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4854087 if we got to do this again i would win it
4854088 innocents are losing their lives in the wake of explicit communal tension in different parts of the country the centre is unconcerned and sits smugly even after bombs rock country streets
4854089 inflation is touching 13 per cent which has no parallel in the past 30 years and the finance minister says it can go up further widespread poverty illiteracy and unemployment are a perfect breeding ground for naxalites in the country act now or we might reach a situation of no return
4854090 we are faced with certain old laws governing compensation in case of certain shops which are flooded in hoshiarpur i am told the compensation does not work out to more than rs 2 000 which is too paltry
4854091 let us look into the details of the announcement and the possible steps here before any formal announcement
4854092 people from punjab have not been given a fair deal by the centre which did not even appropriately react to a state lad bagging an olympic gold we did not even get a nice job done message for unparalleled wheat harvest this year
4854093 power is the biggest priority sector for my government and i assure all that the government will have a surplus before we quit office this time the state has already launched a programme for 6 000 mw power in the coming couple of years the major thermal projects include 1 980 mw at talwandi sabo 1 320 mw at rajpura 2 000 mw at gidderbaha 1 200 mw at mukerian
4854094 we also want that these people should see one another from near meet and talk but out limitations on the border prevent us from such actions
4854095 if a posh area with sewers have been flooded you can imagine the plight of people living in low lying areas like salim tabri

4854099 besides other actions like cancellation and suspension of licences drugs worth rs 3 crore had been seized and cases filed in the courts against violators of the act in one and half years when the sad bjp came to power
4854100 i am committed to save punjabs youth from drug menace hence the drive
4854101 we are not targeting any one but acting against those drug store owners who are in the habit of selling drugs to youth to make a quick buck
4854102 we are facing the shortage of three phased meters but have sufficient number of single phased meters
4854103 a company had even offered to sell three phased meters at as low price as rs 1 800 a unit but its rates were not approved

4854116 he has done ever so well and is in a real run of goals scoring six in five pre season friendlies after his late burst last season
4854117 hes leaner too hes worked hard and has been on a different diet it would be a real shame if hes got another injury now but i think hell be all right

4854119 heres pearl who has resurrected tennessee basketball by employing a pressing running up tempo style mixed with master marketing and sideline theatrics
4854120 after a win pitino is apt to head out to an upscale eatery such as porcini
4854121 i went looking for pearl after the university of kentucky game in knoxville last season and he already had changed into a cabana shirt and was hanging out with a crowd of boosters heres where they are similar both are willing to adapt their personal styles to give themselves a chance to win both are driven by an other worldly work ethic both are big believers in creating momentum and using it to their advantage and in having their teams apply pressure rather than react to it and both are marvelous motivators

4854130 i dont think were ever going to see another depression
4854131 i think the chances of having a great depression are virtually zero
4854132 i dont think were ever going to see another depression
4854133 i heard a lot of avalanches around us i thought im too young to die
4854134 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4854135 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4854136 we have a tremendous opportunity to use the 2010 olympic and paralympic winter games as a catalyst to solve the public disorder problems that affect our city
4854137 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4854138 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4854139 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan
4854140 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4854141 well show you how to make your shiny new tools work for your audience
4854142 listen im not going to sit here and assert that barack obama definitely is a hippopotamus but im also not going to say that i totally reject the possibility
4854143 certainly if you look at what he has done in his short time in the senate and the fact that the american people have yet to totally gotten to know him where theres smoke there is almost always fire
4854144 heres what we do know he has the most pro hippo record in the senate even more than the self described hippopotamus enthusiast senator mikulski of maryland
4854145 my opponent has consistently voted to protect natural parks and wildlife reserves including a number of swamps we wanted to drain and attempt to drill for oil and he has been at the forefront of any number of campaigns to direct federal money to african relief efforts just from his extremist legislative history alone there is no doubt that at least his sympathies are with the hippo population if not his dna and genetic makeup as well
4854146 and where do hippos come from for the most part
4854147 what we have here is a desperate attempt by a desperate candidate to smear barack obama with inane claims
4854148 barack is proud of his voting record as he has always stood on principle not mud patches on the bottoms of lakes
4854149 maybe john mccain should stop worrying so much about the species of his opponent and start focusing on creating a positive message that resonates to more than just some small den of foxes as we clearly know thats where his entire base is
4854150 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4854151 i was originally thinking st louis first because pittsburgh went to the cup finals and had a really good team
4854152 but st louis has been rebuilding for the last while so they filled up their roster with a lot of young guys which makes less room for me pittsburgh is more open than st louis
4854153 thats what you work hard for since you were a little kid you just want your shot i felt good about my year i worked hard and its definitely something to look forward to and something to train hard for this summer
4854154 they lost some guys like colby armstrong and ryan malone that are along the lines of my type of player
4854155 theyre a really good team so they have their top two lines that are pretty much set in stone
4854156 all theyre trying to do is fill out the bottom two theres a couple of spots there
4854157 i think im going to use this camp more as an experience to try and help me out when i come back to junior
4854158 id love to play there but i dont think im ready for that right yet if i could get to stick to the american hockey league or something like that id take it
4854159 im going to go in there work hard chase the puck hard finish checks and play my game
4854160 im not going to go in there and score goals so i need to impress them with the things i can do
4854161 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
4854162 in my conversation with crows father he said he and his son were tickled pink that the nationals drafted him
4854163 that was his exact words tickled pink yeah so i think this was strictly a negotiation
4854164 the decision to turn down the offer the nationals made was made pragmatically and had to do with the financial terms
4854165 we would not have made an offer to them lower than we wanted to make if aaron had decided he did not want to sign with the nationals

4854167 what the heck its not every weekend a girl like me gets to act like a 14 year old boy
4854168 weve just got to hope its only cramp with craig bellamy and kieron dyer still out its the last thing we need from our point of view to see deano out as well
4854169 he has done ever so well and is in a real run of goals scoring six in five pre season friendlies after his late burst last season
4854170 hes leaner too hes worked hard and has been on a different diet it would be a real shame if hes got another injury now but i think hell be all right
4854171 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4854172 im not the one out on the ice scoring the goals or making the hits
4854173 but i think that with the dedication you put into it making sure their skates are sharpened you just get that feeling when they go out on the ice you make sure theyre worry free they dont have anything to worry about like if their skates are sharp or their gear is wet
4854174 youre making sure that the only thing thats on their mind is playing hockey and winning
4854175 we have 14 clubs with teams from whycocomagh cheticamp sydney and north sydney
4854176 its just an excellent day to get them all together its a chance for them to try their skills against other teams
4854177 i am so glad i have w blue sky lives

4854181 uh huh so howd you sneak up on me like that
4854182 sneak man ive eaten logging crews that didnt make as much noise as you do moving through the woods
4854183 you got any jack or anything on you maybe a flask
4854184 uh youre welcome so why do you sasquatch americans hide from people
4854185 hide man look around were not hiding we just live in the middle of fucking nowhere do you know how hard it is to get broadband out here fucking hard let me tell you
4854186 and every time we try to hang with you guys you scream shit and run away not always in that order
4854187 how much more j d do you have in that flask
4854188 president kennedy was pilloried by the super patriots as a no win chief the far right became a fount of proposals born of frustration and put forward in the name of anti communism active duty commanders played host to anti communist seminars on their bases and attended or addressed right wing meetings elsewhere
4854189 could think of manufacturing something that would be generally acceptable
4854190 should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the cuban government as rash and irresponsible and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the western hemisphere
4854191 by manufacturing various pieces of evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the cubans
4854192 a series of well coordinated incidents to take place in and around
4854193 start riots near the main gate of the base others would pretend to be saboteurs inside the base ammunition would be blown up fires started aircraft sabotaged mortars fired at the base with damage to installations
4854194 we could blow up a u s ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba
4854195 casualty lists in u s newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation
4854196 we could develop a communist cuban terror campaign in the miami area in other florida cities and even in washington
4854197 the terror campaign could be pointed at cuban refugees seeking haven in the united states we could sink a boatload of cubans en route to florida real or simulated we could foster attempts on lives of cuban refugees in the united states even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized
4854198 create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the united states to jamaica guatemala panama or venezuela the destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross cuba the passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non scheduled flight
4854199 make it appear that communist cuban migs have destroyed a usaf aircraft over international waters in an unprovoked attack
4854200 that this responsibility for both oven and covert military operations be assigned to the joint chiefs of staff
4854201 the joint chiefs of staff believe that the cuban problem must be solved in the near future
4854202 further they see no prospect of early success in overthrowing the present communist regime either as a result of internal uprising or external political economic or psychological pressures accordingly they believe that military intervention by the united states will be required to overthrow the present communist regime
4854203 the joint chiefs of staff believe that the united states can undertake military intervention in cuba without risk of general war
4854204 they also believe that the intervention can be accomplished rapidly enough to minimize communist opportunities for solicitation of un action
4854205 t he joint chiefs of staff recommend that a national policy of early military intervention in cuba be adopted by the united states they also recommend that such intervention be undertaken as soon as possible and preferably before the release of national guard and reserve forces presently on active duty
4854206 i am the senior military my job to state what i believe and its his mcnamaras job to approve or disapprove
4854207 he gave general lemnitzer very short shrift and treated him like a schoolboy the general almost stood at attention when he came into the room everything was yes sir and no sir
4854208 we need a shake up of the joint chiefs of staff
4854209 we direly need a new chairman as well as new members
4854210 a contrived cuban attack on an oas organization of americas member could be set up
4854211 and the attacked state could be urged to take measures of self defense and request ice from the u s and oas the u s could almost certainly obtain necessary two thirds support among oas members for collective action against cuba
4854212 any of the contrived situations de above are inherently extremely risky in our democratic system in which security can be maintained after the fact with very great difficulty if the decision should be made to set up a contrived situation it be one in which participation by u s personnel is limited only to the most highly trusted covert personnel this suggests the infeasibility of the use of military units for any aspect of the contrived situation
4854213 the only area remaining for ration then would be to bribe one of castros subordinate commanders to initiate an attack on the u s naval base at guantanamo
4854214 a possible scenario whereby an attack on a united states reconnaissance aircraft could be exploited toward the end of effecting the removal of the castro regime
4854215 t he u s could undertake various measures designed to stimulate the cubans to provoke a new incident
4854216 flaunting our freedom of action hoping to stir the cuban military to action
4854217 depending above all on whether the cubans were or could be made to be trigger happy the development of the initial downing of a reconnaissance plane could lead at best to the elimination of castro perhaps to the removal of soviet troops and the installation of ground inspection in cuba or at the least to our demonstration of firmness on reconnaissance
4854218 we could blow up a u s ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba casualty lists in u s newspapers cause a helpful wave of indignation

4854244 it said that our people die 25 years before people who dont receive our services and the reasons were all smoking related
4854245 it was shocking were a health care agency and we were doing things that are not healthy
4854246 ive done nothing in my career except psychiatry and weve been hesitant to go there with our patients
4854247 one thing that would just break my heart was when people would say to me i didnt smoke until i got here and there was nothing else to do during the time when everyone was out there smoking
4854248 there was concern that going smoke free may discourage people from getting psychiatric treatment and also concern that for people who have very limited rights within the facility this is a thing they choose to do and if theyre there for a long period of time that they are being deprived of something that other people have as a right

4854286 a recent mission to iraq headed by top archaeologists from the u s and u k who specialize in mesopotamia found that contrary to received wisdom southern iraqs most important historic sites eight of them had neither been seriously damaged nor looted after the american invasion
4854287 the international team had been expecting to find considerable evidence of looting after 2003 but to their astonishment and relief there was none not a single recent dig hole was found at the eight sites and the only evidence of illegal digging came from holes which were partially covered with silt and vegetation which means they were several years old

4854311 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4854312 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4854313 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4854314 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had

4854344 independent india is 28 years old today i was 19 a few months ago in school they told me i was the citizen of tomorrow around me i saw the citizens of today and wondered what purpose i was going to serve they seemed worn and jaded and cynical to my fellow citizens of the future independence day merely meant early mornings in starched uniforms on parade grounds relieved only by the comforting thought of no more classes in college they were more sensible they just gave us a holiday and the chowkidar unfurled the flag
4854345 conjures up visions of mammoth patriotic rallies outside red fort a reminder of freedom and self reliance and the hope of unexploited progress but when the drums have been beaten and the cavalcade has passed the cheering invariably seems to subside into a desultory grumble our capacity for unproductive complaint is seemingly limitless but then we appear to have developed the art of destructive criticism to the proportions of a national characteristic perhaps it is because as a former colony we are used to bemoaning our lot without being able to do anything about it
4854346 the strange spectacle of a nation without nationals of indians who are not involved in india
4854347 that one is an all too dispensable part of the indian reality is surely all the more reason why one should take ones role all the more seriously instead of affecting the dislocated detachment that has become the untaxed perquisite of citizenship

4854356 but these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4854382 although he had a more perfect knowledge of the christian doctrine than pauls accusers had yet he deferred the hearing of the cause until lysias had come down
4854383 he deferred them and said after i have been more accurately informed concerning this way when lysias has come down i will hear the cause
4854384 to transgress the laws of her forefathers and to marry felix
4854385 seems to have been lest drusilla who was a jewess and knew that what she had done was against the law of moses might be influenced by pauls discourse and felixs happiness with her disturbed what is said of felix act 24 26 seems to show that he had no remorse of conscience for what he had done

4854387 it is not their custom to condemn men before they are heard

4854389 they had a dispute about one dead jesus whom paul affirmed to be alive
4854390 whether he the messiah by a resurrection of dead people
4854391 since thou believest the prophecies and since i have shown that they are fulfilled in jesus of nazareth that he corresponds in person character and work with the prophets it follows that his religion is true

4854401 social media tools like facebook youtube and twitter have clearly changed the face of american political dialogue and were looking to extend this groundswell thinking into real world events
4854402 if we can start an interactive public conversation among activists and supporters then weve helped lessen the divide between the social and political spheres
4854403 as progressive women and men living in the united states of america we believe that the american dream means extending equality of opportunity to every american and working to narrow the gap between opportunity and outcome we see no reason why the outcome of any americans pursuit of happiness should be economic destitution caused by unemployment inflation high energy costs lack of health care or any of the other myriad problems facing everyday americans today america can do better and as progressives we pledge ourselves to working for greater opportunities and better outcomes for all americans
4854404 this ad is just more of the same old false and discredited attacks that senator mccain knows arent true senator mccain will say or do anything to hide the truth while obama will cut taxes for the middle class mccain will give a billion dollars in new tax breaks to americas eight largest corporations while his plan provides no direct relief for more than 100 million american families and despite his rhetoric hes refusing to support the bipartisan senate proposal to expand production and invest in renewable energy because he wants to protect tax breaks for oil companies weve seen what happens when we put the oil companies and their lobbyists ahead of working families and thats exactly what americans want to change in this election

4854407 what i love about jeremy gilley and the peace one day campaign is that the whole thing was started by just one individual who is trying to make a difference despite the odds we all have so much potential but we dont tend to realize it so we take it for granted the work of peace one day encourages and inspires people to think about what we can all do both at individual and collective levels there are better and alternative means to conflict resolution than killing and maiming the enemy political leaders and power brokers have too much invested in the industry of war rather than implementing peaceful solutions what is life without peace peace is for the highest good and as a global community it is one of the things we need to value above everything
4854408 we now have a remarkable chance to each do our part to commit to peaceful activities on peace day and this day has been proven to save lives
4854409 i am excited to be in new york to celebrate this important day with internationally acclaimed singers like annie lennox bryan adams and natasha bedingfield
4854410 i am thrilled to have an accomplished executive and legislator join our team
4854411 jason is the realization of nbjcs vision of a society where we all live and serve openly as americans
4854412 forward to working with everyone at nbjc and within the civil rights and lgbt communities ever since nbjc counseled me on my coming out i have wanted to give back to the african american lgbt community we will together advance nbjcs membership programming and civil rights agenda as well as continue to brand the organization as the national leader on these issues
4854413 one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport
4854414 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4854415 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4854416 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4854417 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4854418 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4854419 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4854420 its so great to be a chicagoan today i absolutely love it
4854421 its pretty cool looks real cool when you go close to it
4854422 they move real fast and they almost hit each other
4854423 its been a lifelong dream to be a pilot and just to see these guys come out here and do that you can only come out here and see this in chicago
4854424 and when youre out doing your job the view outside your window is always changing thats the best part about it
4854425 victoria beckham will be presenting her collection of dresses during new yorks fashion week by appointment only over a several day period
4854426 the most compelling evidence of all for the effectiveness of safe sex is the simple fact that when safe sex was taken on by men who have sex with men msm the escalation in infection rates was pegged back
4854427 this made it immediately clear that the risk of hiv infection was not associated with male to male sex per se rather it was associated with unsafe male to male sex
4854428 many of the samples in studies cited by the red cross are very small recruited from men at high risk and explicitly exclude men who practise safe sex in monogamous relationships they are not representative of all men who have sex with men
4854429 in those whose behaviour is exclusively heterosexual safe sex practices are less common if there was an outbreak of hiv amongst heterosexuals in australia it would clearly spread more rapidly than it would in the gay community
4854430 there is no evidence anywhere that people become gay by choice
4854431 the deferral of men who have sex with men is based on who they are rather than what they have recently done and can be likened to deferral on the grounds of being jewish or indigenous
4854432 it is a forward looking platform in so many areas including those relating to lgbt people the task force action fund is certainly pleased to see that in the opening paragraph of the section titled a more perfect union for the first time the platform explicitly calls for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity this demonstrates the success and unprecedented partnership between lgbt advocates and courageous public leaders including representative baldwin in educating the public and policymakers on the need for fully inclusive anti discrimination protections
4854433 the 2008 platform reiterates and strengthens past support for legislation that would protect our community including calls for the passage of hate crimes and comprehensive employment discrimination legislation and the repeal of the discriminatory dont ask dont tell policy in our nations military the platform also supports the full inclusion of same sex couples and their families with equal rights benefits and responsibilities for the first time the platform opposes the discriminatory defense of marriage act which bars federal recognition of even those same sex couples legally married under state law the platform also supports other issues of importance for glbt and all americans including a call for a national strategy to combat hiv aids support for fair and impartial judges not driven by ideology and requirements that faith based programs not use federal dollars to discriminate
4854434 this platform stands in stark contrast to a republican party which continues to marginalize millions of americans from full inclusion in public life just because of who they are or the person they love

4854608 never before in our history have we added that number of people to our population base 330 000 people per year is a rate and pace that were not really comfortable with were used to growing at the 220 230 000 per year our systems our infrastructure our culture can cope with that were un used to traveling at this pace
4854609 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4854610 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4854611 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4854612 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4854613 she has always got her grandkids with her the whole family is just real close
4854614 epic said mark spitz whose record of seven golds has held up since the 1972 munich olympics it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4854615 there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps said cornel marculescu of switzerland the executive director of swimmings international federation
4854616 its almost too close to see one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4854617 only an olympic record not a world mark after doing so in his other six victories
4854618 weve just got to hope its only cramp with craig bellamy and kieron dyer still out its the last thing we need from our point of view to see deano out as well
4854619 he has done ever so well and is in a real run of goals scoring six in five pre season friendlies after his late burst last season
4854620 hes leaner too hes worked hard and has been on a different diet it would be a real shame if hes got another injury now but i think hell be all right
4854621 unfortunately this city commission does not understand the consequences of working against tbc texas border coalition valley interfaith nature preserves and everyone eleses efforts to stop the border wall construction all of the border cities throughout are united with tbc and are fighting on brownsvilles behalf but our commissioners unwillingness to stand united against the federal government undermines all who oppose the wall

4854639 our teachers were absolute tyrants they had no sympathy with youth their one object was to stuff our brains and turn us into erudite apes like themselves if any pupil showed the slightest trace of originality they persecuted him relentlessly and the only model pupils whom i have ever got to know have all been failures in after life

4854644 i hit two pieces off the target that were very small that i saw a lot of people in the stands saw them
4854645 they didnt see it hit but again i missed seven targets out of 125 at the end of the day any one of those targets i could have hit and it would have put me higher in the standings otherwise its just incredible
4854646 hell definitely be one of the favorites for the gold in 2012 im proud of him he really did shock the shooting world he came out of nowhere and was right there with a chance to go to the medal podium

4854649 i am totally sickened after reading what passes for journalism at the st pete times these days i guess were all lucky that your boss didnt send you to eat kittens tamara since its obvious you would have you should be ashamed but probably arent
4854650 im an ex vegetarian who is now an omnivore who eats a little meat now and then but the notion of eating lions such grand animals barely surviving humanitys onslaught truly sickens and angers and repulses me
4854651 perhaps they havent seen the un or pew reports that say the eating meat is unsustainable eating lions so sad that anyone would pay to do something so irresponsible
4854652 all captive lion breeders in south africa sell their progeny for hunting because it is not only the only market for them but a very lucrative one and they are always looking for add ons whereby they can commercially exploit another aspect of canned lion breeding the current one is cub petting whereby the cute and cuddly stage is exploited before the animal is old enough to be hunted in this way they can externalize the cost of rearing the victim and now lion meat is being marketed to make canned lion breeding ever more profitable
4854653 las palomas wma is a great opportunity for the hunter who doesnt currently have a lease or an uncle with 10 acres
4854654 the annual public hunting permit allows you to hunt all of these units in the valley for white wing mourning dove whitetip quail and at three of our units you can even hunt chachalacas
4854655 these are very accessible for the public not crowded and there are food plots
4854656 the anacua unit is historically one of the densest white wing nesting areas in the valley
4854657 a great mourning dove area and it offers chachalaca hunting too
4854658 actually a pretty good place to hunt its not very big but there are a lot of birds flying over it
4854659 it was on the river a very good place near penitas and homeland security and the u s fish amp wildlife service said nope you cant hunt it it still may be listed on the tpwd web site but its incorrect if it is
4854660 but the real deal is to buy the public hunting permit
4854661 a person in mcallen or harlingen or brownsville can be hunting 15 minutes after getting off work

4854671 the application landscape is undergoing significant change as developers and architects demand a combination of powerful capabilities and simplicity in the next generation of enterprise applications
4854672 the commercial release of springsource enterprise coupled with the recent introduction of the springsource application platform delivers the flexible and modular alternatives that the market is looking for in their application infrastructure
4854673 we chose springsource enterprise because it offers hands on responsive commercial support for our large enterprise projects

4854678 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
4854679 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point

4854681 weve been dealing with all these rumors about darrin and how hes lazy in class but he has a 3 0 gpa and is on schedule to graduate on time

4854687 i want notre dame to win because i want those coaches to be there when darrin comes back
4854688 i wouldnt let darrin transfer to pitt even if he wanted to
4854689 i want him to graduate from notre dame hes not going anywhere and hell be back in january
4854690 the entire route of the btc the only major oil pipeline from the caspian region outside of russias control should now be treated as high risk and turkeys viability as an energy bridge to europe has been thrown into question
4854691 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries there is no definite attempt by russia to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
4854692 could render further foreign investment in any oil and gas transport links that bypass russia too risky

4854746 reconciliation is not in the works and not even being discussed now
4854747 i didnt because the name bynum represents a legacy of people that have gone before me and had i done that i would have given too much power to an individual to not just wipe me out but to wipe out the integrity of the legacy i was born in

4854790 players are driven into thinking that the champions league is the be all and end all it really isnt i tell you
4854791 you dont mind if your top player is in control its when your mediocre player is in control
4854792 im not talking about any player in particular im just talking about the state of the game in general
4854793 in my day the players had no power whatsoever and you always felt you were hard done by and that no one was there to support you in our day we yearned for a halfway house but now it has gone miles in the other direction
4854794 at forest we won the european cup twice and those days were fantastic but it was the league competition the 42 matches we played in that that was everything thats what you lived for every single saturday
4854795 there wasnt one person at villa myself the chairman especially the fans who would have wanted to see gareth leave and go to liverpool or anywhere else
4854796 the shortages become more and more critical over the next few years
4854797 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4854798 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4854799 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4854800 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4854801 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4854802 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4854803 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4854804 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4854805 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4854806 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4854807 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4854808 i just called back to the people in the tape room and everybody said it was expletive
4854809 were talking about a lot of punches that didnt get counted
4854810 i cant definitively say the judges are favoring the chinese
4854811 but it would take three out of the five judges working each match to favor china and i havent seen anything to support that
4854812 did you see the gift that guy from china just got
4854813 you never see anyone come back in this olympics and this guy was down three or four points
4854814 li was hitting him with his elbows all the time but he was still scoring
4854815 the only one receiving cautions was robson this is really wrong
4854816 i knew what it was going to be like ive been watching the scoring the past few days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it
4854817 you will have to give me a bout number and i will look at it
4854818 i thought i was moving great and getting my punches off but i guess they thought otherwise thats what the judges saw so i guess i have to go with what they say
4854819 i just called back to the people in the tape room and everybody said it was expletive
4854820 were talking about a lot of punches that didnt get counted

4854830 its an ongoing and never ending process basically educating staff and keeping policy current with changing technology because we have to make sure things are secure but also accessible so we can do our business
4854831 the bottom line is that theres a lot more outreach so folks are aware
4854832 i think maybe we felt we were doing things in the right order but i think after last fall we looked at it we talked to the privacy officer and so forth we decided that we should have our own written policy
4854833 were doing what we can to prevent it theres little bitty things like when a grad student thats been teaching for us leaves us in may before we move somebody else into that office we go in and check to see if theres any papers and so forth around i think thats part of what we were not doing before we make sure thats all disposed of
4854834 ku is approaching it on a multitiered front youve got to approach it not from a network security standpoint but also from the workstation the data how do people use computers
4854835 to me the physical security is an important piece of it but the electronic data is 100 times more important
4854836 if a school is not concerned about maintaining the security of their network then i think theyre missing the boat
4854837 its a big issue and its a tremendous challenge that these universities have
4854838 its good to go out and get points early then youre not battling so much from behind
4854839 weve got one of the youngest teams here and theyre going up against guys who are 32 34 28 and know how the system works

4854850 but i feel like i was able to breathe easier without this being in the forefront all of the time

4854853 i was told she could walk off with the house and leave me in the cold

4854875 prescott looks dangerous but hes just the kind of opponent i need at this stage of my career
4854876 he may have been knocking them out left right and centre but im going to make him wake up and smell the coffee
4854877 ive been working on my defensive skills with new coach jorge rubio and it looks like prescott will be testing out what ive been learning in the gym
4854878 along with my strength and conditioning coach im also punching harder than ever before and i think my offensive skills are going to win me this fight
4854879 khan is just a boy i will knock him out
4854880 what will be wonderful about the new chairs is that people will find something else to talk about
4854881 its most appropriate for it to have a larger profile
4854882 lincoln is one of the largest figures in american history and to have a real interactive and immersive way to understand his importance then and his relevance today will be a great experience for visitors
4854883 in the last 48 hours i have received hundreds of text messages phone calls and e mails from people asking me when joey gilbert and jesse brinkley are finally going to fight
4854884 everywhere i go in reno people stop me and ask the same question when are you fighting jesse northern nevada wants to see this fight and i dont think anyone wants it more than i do i know jesse feels the same way with that said i cordially invite mr jesse brinkley to meet me in reno before the end of 2008 and fight to the finish
4854885 what is he waiting for you have to go up there and embarrass him
4854886 i pay no attention i hear the same stuff all the time and its a bit of a joke
4854887 we tried to get pavlik to fight me after the jeff lacy fight and he declined it because he wanted to fight for the middleweight title
4854888 and i think we asked him again after he won the title but he declined again
4854889 i think he is possibly just trying to get publicity off the back of me
4854890 obviously everyone wants a pay day but he will have to go and find it somewhere else
4854891 this guy has just started and you cant talk about him as a great fighter because to be that you have to fight great names and reign for a long time which he has not done
4854892 roy jones is a legend and that is the difference
4854893 ive achieved everything i wanted to achieve the one thing that is missing is to fight at madison square garden
4854894 im fighting one of the best fighters of the last 20 years at the mecca of boxing
4854895 there is no way i am going to get beaten in my last fight to go down in history as an undefeated world champion means so much to me
4854896 this last fight is more important than his first fight group dp vip
4854897 ill never forgive myself if i lose my last fight
4854898 its a massive fight and it will be my last
4854899 ive known for a while when i want to go out and as long as i put on a great performance this is my time
4854900 if i can do that then ive achieved everything ive wanted to achieve in my career
4854901 i would never forgive myself if i came to my last fight and threw it all away complacency is not in my mindset
4854902 but i know in my heart this is the right time to stop and my aim is to remain undefeated i want to win and win in style
4854903 fighting at madison square garden will be incredible and its amazing how things have turned around for me
4854904 it took eight years for me to get the chance to fight the best but there was a lot of politics going on
4854905 its been very difficult to prove myself to the americans they never rated the europeans mainly because they wouldnt go out there but ive always beaten the best americans group dp vip

4854916 i felt like i was moving great getting my punches off but i guess some of the judges thought otherwise
4854917 i felt like i was throwing a lot but i guess they didnt count for a lot

4854919 the comeback is an amazing thing but he can do anything
4854920 hes a young boxer and he had surprised me in chicago at the world championships because i didnt know him
4854921 that left a bitter taste i even still remember the score this time the plan was to make him doubt straightaway because hes not the kind of boxer who can come back if hes trailing on the scoreboard
4854922 besides the aiba governs only amateur boxers it doesnt have a hold on professionals who are under the wings of different organizations in pro boxing
4854923 the international federations are the ones who accredit athletes in the olympics and the ioc respects that authority
4854924 the ioc cannot impose its rule on the international federations
4854925 pros and amateurs are governed by different set of rules
4854926 amateur fights are four rounders and safety is the premium consideration its about winning bouts on points by making clear hits and not knockouts remember also that amateurs wear protective helmets to absorb the power of head blows

4854942 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4854943 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4854944 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4854945 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4854946 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4854947 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4854948 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4854949 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4854950 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4854951 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

4854963 im looking forward to having a lot of fun and making a lot of new friends and hoping that it will be better here and that i wont miss my family much

4855086 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4855087 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4855088 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4855089 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4855090 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming

4855128 sixty years of memorizing the quran and its recitations has made me unable to forget any of it i can recall every ayah its surah and its juz i know the ayaat that are similar mutashabih and how to recite the same ayah in different qiraaat i feel like i know the quran like my name i cannot imagine forgetting a letter of it or making a mistake in it i dont know anything other than the quran and its recitations i never learned a science listened to a lecture or memorized anything other than the quran and the mutoon that were related to the quran and tajweed i dont know anything other than that
4855129 i remember every one of them there were some who received ijaaza in one of the recitations and there were some and they were very few who received ijaaza in all ten recitations they are the ones who receive an ijaaza with a special seal that i have that i always keep with me i never give it to anyone no matter how much i have trust in them
4855130 and some of the men hesitated to recite to me considering that im a woman and some refused but shaykh muhammad ismaeel the most well known shaykh of quran and sunnah in gave a fatwa that they could when he learned of my age and he sent his entire family to me to recite to me
4855131 i was not able to keep my promise to my shaykha nufaysa he used to recite to me the quran in all ten recitations i became comfortable with him and he was like me in that he was blind and memorized the quran at an early age i taught him for five years and when he finished he asked me for my hand in marriage and i accepted
4855132 alhamdullilah i feel like allah chooses for me the good always maybe if i had children i would have become busy with them and neglected the quran or forgot it

4855153 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4855154 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4855155 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4855156 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4855157 gosh and all this time i thought it was because producers want you to buy both the box set and the obvious title they left out no they would never do that would they
4855158 you can make these up to one week in advance
4855159 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4855160 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson

4855170 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4855171 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4855172 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4855173 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4855174 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4855175 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4855176 should in no way limit or put in danger freedom of movement and travel along the road and rail axes of georgia
4855177 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4855178 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4855179 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4855180 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence

4855186 weve had a number of discussions over a couple of months
4855187 i was flattered but aca like today tonight is a style of program ive done
4855188 thats not to rule out doing something else in tv one day
4855189 but i did that kind of thing for 12 years and its now time to move on to something different a different challenge
4855190 its not something that suits where i am at the moment
4855191 but nothing is guaranteed and there is nothing more vulnerable than when youre in the lead
4855192 it appears that some passages of the agreement are vague enough to allow unending talks
4855193 russian tanks continue to drive back and forth close to tbilisi there are also important military manoeuvres in central georgia
4855194 yes ideally we would like a vote formalizing the ceasefire this weekend
4855195 we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4855196 i dropped it into a good lie where i did
4855197 i didnt have too many options honestly i was thinking to try to get it about 10 feet past the hole and make that putt for par

4855250 the reality is that all cities that have water shortages have to look at it
4855251 reusing treated water for drinking purposes is definitely part of australias water future
4855252 we are already the driest continent and climate change is making that worse so its very important that australia is one of the first countries to adopt recycled water and recycled water for drinking
4855253 they should be investigating the possibility of using that water to replenish our reservoirs and eventually have it coming out of our taps
4855254 the water compact that colorado and other upper basin states have with california and arizona should be renegotiated
4855255 in a telephone interview with the pueblo chieftain the presumptive gop candidate for president said the water sharing agreement reached in 1922 between seven western states doesnt take into account increases in population and changing water needs
4855256 the colorado river compact allocates 7 5 million acre feet of water to california nevada and arizona anything left over is split between colorado utah new mexico and wyoming
4855257 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 percent reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change in the southwest instead of threatening a diminishing resource it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration
4855258 needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
4855259 he will not get a more fierce fight from a united states senator than he will have from me
4855260 on this issue he couldnt be more wrong nothing is more crucial for colorado than water and i oppose any suggestion that the federal government should get involved in how we share it with arizona california or any other state
4855261 were not talking about short term here his comments are based on his fundamental understanding of the challenges faced by western states
4855262 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
4855263 at a minimum it would pit these basin states against one another in extended negotiations instead of facilitating cooperative efforts to address the significant water supply challenges facing the arid west thats not the kind of leadership we need
4855264 the only way forward to a secure water future is to recognize our supply limits and live within them
4855265 for ryan to come back 20 minutes later and almost have us finish 1 2 its a pretty incredible swim

4855267 when me and michael talk its strictly anything but swimming
4855268 thats good for both of us were not always getting wound up about the olympic thing
4855269 there is no way im going to bad mouth the united states
4855270 everything ive ever had in my life i owe to the united states i didnt have to live through that war i didnt have to sleep in a bunker so im very fortunate
4855271 it would be kind of nice to one day when people speak of michael phelps winning seven gold medals and have lost the opportunity to win eight theyll talk about that guy that took it away from him

4855274 it could be something like walking in front of each other at the mall to competing at the olympics
4855275 everything he does has to have some competitive piece to it
4855276 im not going in my back room taking down my splits im not thinking about swimming at home thats just who i am i dont really define myself as a swimmer i bet it ticks off a lot of other swimmers because i really dont care i care if i lose but i wont go into a shelter and close a door for days i lost oh well ill try to make it better the next time win or lose it doesnt really matter
4855277 michael is michael and he doesnt like to lose in anything
4855278 i think we all wanted to be the best that we can be and theres a streak of perfectionism in all of us which we probably got from my mom well do whatever we can to be the best we can

4855282 we definitely expect a slowdown in the growth of the tv market
4855283 if you compete in the low end you end up damaging your brand and your profitability

4855287 as everyone knows tennis is an elegant sport and it brings with it many requirements for spectators in terms of manners
4855288 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
4855289 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
4855290 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
4855291 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
4855292 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
4855293 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
4855294 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
4855295 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
4855296 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
4855297 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4855298 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4855299 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4855300 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4855301 dont go out with me then am i that bad a girlfriend

4855311 which as any musician knows doesnt mean playing out of tune or out of time but rather discerning what is appropriate in terms of the story so far and the storys intended conclusion

4855319 today was a good opportunity for us to see what we have to work on before next friday
4855320 we have to find the same mentality that we had last year that is playing as hard as we can until the whistle blows
4855321 there were some outstanding contributions today from both of our goalkeepers tara isbell and katrina goscha
4855322 melisa curry sophie hargreaves nicole evans and jenna fioranelli had outstanding contributions too
4855323 i was in contact with tom hicks and i was told we have the money because we were selling players for more than 20 million so we had enough and we have enough
4855324 and if we sell or one or two players well have enough to sign another good player i will not say which player but i have the support of at least one of the owners
4855325 the question is that we have to be quicker and i told them these things four years ago and i continue thinking the same
4855326 my commitment to the club is 100 per cent to the fans with the players with the club in general ive said it 100 times my family is really happy here and i want to win trophies with liverpool
4855327 but thats what the premier league is all about one or two maybe got tired in the last 10 or 15 minutes but i cant really fault my players
4855328 that whosoever believeth in me shall have forever lasting life

4855336 muchas cosas me parecen que no pueden ser cumplidas como la segunda l nea del metro porque la primera l nea ni siquiera funciona todav a
4855337 tampoco creo lo de la carreteras y t neles porque todav a hay carreteras inconclusas como la de ban y la del coral
4855338 el discurso de fern ndez fue un discurso de grandes expectativas y promesas creo que el presidente tiene aspiraciones muy amplias para este pr ximo cuatrienio esperemos en dios que eso pueda ser llamado a cabo
4855339 saludo el llamado a di logo pol tico por parte de fern ndez a los partidos de dejar a un lado las diferencias para que todos nos concentremos en los debates de las reformas que tenemos
4855340 si vemos los n meros que present el presidente al principio del discurso son n meros que no van de acuerdo con la realidad porque el presidente habla de 500 mil nuevos empleos y esos empleos no se sienten en rep blica dominicana

4855353 i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me though he may die he shall live
4855354 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
4855355 i am the vine you are the branches he who abides in me and i in him bears much fruit for without me you can do nothing if anyone does not abide in me he is cast out as a branch and is withered and they gather them and throw them into the fire and they are burned
4855356 do not think that i came to destroy the law or the prophets i did not come to destroy but to fulfill
4855357 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into various trials knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience but let patience have its perfect work that you may be perfect and complete lacking nothing
4855358 the problem with man is that we try to rationalize everything our own pride gets in the way
4855359 so the bottom line question is this should be be trying to comfortably manuever and fit god into our world or should we be trying to submit to his pefect will for our lives
4855360 enter by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and there are many who go in by it
4855361 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man
4855362 for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith
4855363 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god
4855364 how is that materially different from mohammad atta and his confederates purporting to hear and accept gods words in the quran what yardstick could a nonbeliever who doesnt already accept your conclusion use to distinguish between the two

4855385 the final age has begun history will close upon jesus imminent return jesus seen more as messiah than divine being
4855386 the concept of messiah means nothing jesus the son of god came to earth died was resurrected and restored is now lord and present to his worshippers
4855387 life in christ produces what the law cannot but with few hard and fast ethical rules love not law little interest in jesus life emphasis on him as second adam
4855388 jesus life was secondary to his relation to the father and the divine nature of christ
4855389 a continuation of judaism jesus is messiah in succession to the prophets not divine not virgin born will be messiah son of man at return an ethnic religion they loathed paul

4855397 when gordon brown called on the british library to stage an exhibition about britishness he perhaps envisaged a patriotic celebration of the national identity
4855398 it is an astonishingly good idea but is clearly a snub to the prime minister and must be accurately embarrassing for him gordon brown likes to talk about britishness a lot without understanding that liberty is at the core of britishness it is our institutional dna our history and tradition of freedom run longer and deeper than any other country

4855409 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4855410 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question

4855433 you dont want to just say that no one wants to hear that these are human lives you cant just announce that today
4855434 by working at it it requires a lot of hard work
4855435 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4855436 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4855437 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4855438 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4855439 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4855440 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4855441 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4855442 i havent played in a while now and its definitely going to be a nerve racking thing for me when i get out there
4855443 im just going to enjoy it and go out there and try to do the best job i can and obviously the speed of the game will be totally different than college was im just going to do the best job i can of not forcing the ball into coverages take what they give you and just run the offense like the coaches ask you to
4855444 right now i dont have the best understanding of it the offense
4855445 this system is very detailed its difficult to pick up and theyve thrown a lot at me
4855446 a lot is being thrown at you but have to learn it and just keep studying as much as possible and get a feel for it and sooner or later hopefully you will have a great understanding of the system
4855447 the best way for me is to get repetition but you really have to pay attention in practice at all points and listen to whatever eli or whoever else is in and just pay attention as much as possible when you watch film you really have to zone in and try to pick up as much information as you can because its tough when youre not getting any reps and youre sitting there on the sideline but thats no excuse and you have to get yourself ready because when they call your number thats your opportunity and you have to go in there and make plays
4855448 he is like a lot of young quarterback he has it all upstairs as far as what the plays are but he is still working on being able to pull it out
4855449 im very happy with his delivery he came into camp with a little hitch in his delivery which has improved he is throwing the ball well but its hard for a guy thats not getting as many reps as the top three quarterbacks to show what he can or cant do weve been happy with what he has done so far
4855450 not in high school not in college not at all
4855451 i didnt really hear about it until the combine and the draft was coming up and thats when it became a big deal
4855452 andre hes a rookie quarterback first time into the nfl and weve all been there and he asks some good questions which is good
4855453 if he doesnt understand something hes stepping up and asking questions which is important for a young quarterback you try to explain things so he understands it
4855454 i know we are all competing but they have all helped me out tremendously and i really listen to all of them because they all have the experience theyve all been in the league for at least five years so all i can do is listen to them and it will benefit me later down the road and really try to get as much information out of all of them as i can about different coverages schemes and what i should be looking for here and there they have really helped me out with a better understanding of every thing
4855455 obviously hes just a young quarterback and he needs to do it more and more to get comfortable with it well give him a limited menu and if gets into that situation fine hes going to go in probably in the third quarter
4855456 i obviously get nervous but i like and enjoy football games and during games i calm down a lot more relax and just play the game and have fun i try and do the best job i can at just directing the offense and controlling the offense to the point where we are having good drives and getting down the field obviously right now the offense is very complicated and ive had to know a lot but hopefully i can just do a great job on directing where the offensive line has to be on pass schemes and run schemes get the receivers on the right track picking up blitzes and if i can do a good job at that i think well be able to move the ball
4855457 im here to service these guys and give lawrence an opportunity to rest up and its a good opportunity for me to get out there get some game film and hope that someone sees me
4855458 you have to do it 100 and really be committed to it so you just stay ready and wait for that call
4855459 weve done a really good job and i told the coaches and the players this yesterday of taking mid stream adjust to a whole new level i flipped a practice around and then i went back to the original way weve flipped some things around quite a bit and we made adjustments to accommodate our team like every team in the league is doing everybody is doing the same thing in order to get their practice
4855460 chances are theyll be out but im not going to say for sure
4855461 technology is changing and will continue to change faster than any government can issue regulations to control it
4855462 even though bernanke has made clear the feds top priority for now is trying to get the economy back on track he also says he remains mindful of inflation risks especially from high energy prices
4855463 what will be the next step how can i stay on track what will happen if we cant control it
4855464 what about turning choosing from being chosen to do something
4855465 you have to serve your soul what is your mission if you think about your childrens future are you helping to build a better place for them
4855466 most investment firms and venture capital funds simply wait for the right kind of businesses to come along they believe strongly in ethical business practices
4855467 it takes only one thing to ruin your reputation but a lifetime building it
4855468 i would prefer that business leaders actually provide leadership so working people who rely on the wage to live dont get screwed by the poor decisions of corporations
4855469 now after meeting and brainstorming with the team at virginunite id strongly recommend them as a candidate because of the way they are creating entrepreneurial solutions to significant problems and a force for good as entrepreneurs we know we can foster innovative solutions to business problems this is the same force being tapped for the greater good im really excited about some of their projects and what us as entrepreneurs can do together youll be hearing more about this soon

4855517 tivemos sorte em alguns momentos n o nos custa reconhecer refiro me especialmente grande penalidade falhada pelo fc porto em que a equipa poderia pressionar ainda mais e tentar chegar igualdade foi uma vit ria justo mas penso que a vantagem m nima seria mais adequada

4855609 if you ask someone to name all the phone numbers you can off the top of your head its going to be pretty interesting
4855610 when i asked the singer to name all of the phone numbers she knew it was fascinating it was her dads office from 20 years ago or a friends number in florence you can tease narrative out of anything on wikipedia there are these lists of things like list of horrible ethnic slurs or list of famous canadian homosexuals thats such a poignant way to organize the world
4855611 weve got sampling keyboards and a lot of screaming ill be brushing my friends hair onstage it all works out
4855612 weve all known each other since the dawn of time and we all have a very flexible musical intelligence its like cooking at your moms house you know where everything is
4855613 the focus on sports for us is a cause for concern because it only promotes sports among the filipino youth while it neglects academics
4855614 if the government wants to push sports development it should also give the same importance to academics to ensure that you produce a nation of healthy productive and well educated citizens
4855615 we should remove this because it will limit the prospects of our young people such as in the course they will take up in college and the career they will pursue
4855616 if theres a purpose for us all it remains a secret to me dont ask me to justify my life
4855617 if you dont have good self awareness being in a successful band will really screw you up
4855618 i dont have any control what people think about me and i understand that they dont really know me what you saw out there were thousands of totally different experiences but my goal has always been to elevate the art form if a fan tells me they did a term paper on evolution because of one of my songs its very touching
4855619 i had big questions about where we come from the things that religion usually satisfies i was learning from science the band had started two years before that and it was really a good synergy because we were talking about bad religion and its implicit in evolution that there are no gods
4855620 early man walked away as modern man took control their minds werent all the same to conquer was his big goal so he built his great empire and slaughtered his own kind then he died a confused man killed himself with his own mind
4855621 i actually think its made us a far more interesting band
4855622 and i think its possible that if i hadnt maintained my academic pursuits the band would have burned out earlier but in terms of satisfaction theres no difference to me between lecturing and performing its all entertainment youre just trying to inspire people
4855623 i saw stuff there that just completely blew me away
4855624 there was one particular card trick that i just couldnt get over i had to learn how to do it
4855625 we came from the rock world which was really different than most magicians its sort of like if two old magicians suddenly formed a rock band just this total fish out of water thing
4855626 it took us four years of steady performing to get that
4855627 i think it shows that were finally accepted up here
4855628 when im playing drums in the band im up there with three other people
4855629 its not all me i love playing music and im not saying anything bad about it in the slightest but im so much more involved in the magic creatively its more fulfilling for me so i think i would choose magic
4855630 the stewardship of this church is taken from matthew 25 to feed the hungry shelter the homeless visit the sick the spirit of st francis of assisi is to reach out to serve others this church is very big in serving the less fortunate
4855631 i was born and raised here and my parents didnt teach me to talk in tagalog before i went on this gk trip i considered myself more american than filipino i got some filipino culture but not a strong identity
4855632 ive always known about the poverty but never firsthand i went into the slums and i saw the stark contrast between the gk villages and the slums we had exposure to what gk is all about just hearing the story and the whole vision i really was attracted to that and seeing my pastors who were sick but still proceeded to do the build for the poor was really inspiring to me
4855633 thats my goal to present opportunities like that to people who have never been exposed to that type of poverty
4855634 i want filipino americans to experience what ive experienced in the gk build because i want them to see how great filipinos are in serving their own countrymen in creating positive and vibrant environment im very proud to be a filipino
4855635 if we want it to be a big parish we could have turned it into a mega church with ten thousand parishioners but thats not our religion our religion is relationship and to just help one another and feed off each other
4855636 fr john would always tell us that the idea of going to the philippines was to help people raise their dignity but in the process the parishioners are the ones being transformed they experience the joys of a simple life
4855637 follows the same patterns of much of the critiques of bookchin of the 1990s it offers an analysis of bookchin and his work without paying sufficient attention to his theoretical and practical programme instead morse relies on the insinuation of personal failings and insidious motives in bookchin that render his revolutionary project a failure
4855638 falls back into the patterns of caricature that surrounded bookchin in the 1990s

4855652 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4855653 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance

4855675 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4855676 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4855677 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4855678 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4855679 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas

4855681 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4855682 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
4855683 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
4855684 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
4855685 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
4855686 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
4855687 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
4855688 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
4855689 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
4855690 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating

4855697 i totally support the anti racist movement that doesnt mean i have to write about that or racism all of the time or read anti racist texts all of the time
4855698 chucks argument was that some like murray who attempted to develop a comprehensive vision of the world and how to change it needed to address the particularities and complexities of race relations and white supremacy at least sometimes

4855894 the i 35w bridges failure raises a serious question namely what should we do about our aging bridges the obvious answer is to replace them but perhaps a better solution is to replace the system that has allowed much of our bridge infrastructure to deteriorate to the place where so much needs replacing
4855895 bridge historians and preservationists are practical people realizing that it is not always necessary to build new if we can maintain the old moreover we can continue to bask in the cultural heritage of the old and that means something

4855897 he will not get a more fierce fight from a united states senator than he will have from me
4855898 on this issue he couldnt be more wrong nothing is more crucial for colorado than water and i oppose any suggestion that the federal government should get involved in how we share it with arizona california or any other state
4855899 were not talking about short term here his comments are based on his fundamental understanding of the challenges faced by western states
4855900 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
4855901 at a minimum it would pit these basin states against one another in extended negotiations instead of facilitating cooperative efforts to address the significant water supply challenges facing the arid west thats not the kind of leadership we need
4855902 the only way forward to a secure water future is to recognize our supply limits and live within them
4855903 we dont have a gasoline price problem we have an addiction problem we are addicted to dirty fossil fuels and this addiction is driving a whole set of toxic trends that are harming our nation and world in many different ways it is intensifying global warming creating runaway global demand for oil and gas weakening our currency by shifting huge amounts of dollars abroad to pay for oil imports destroying plants and animals at record rates

4855907 how many views has this blog had since it was created on march 30 2008
4855908 attention everyone every race colour and creed listen when you hear the band strike up all the trumpets and trombones the tubas and baritones the drums and cymbals fall to your knees and worship the gold statue that king nebuchadnezzar has set up anyone who does not kneel and worship shall be thrown immediately into a roaring furnace
4855909 long live the king you gave strict orders o king that when the big band started playing everyone had to fall to their knees and worship the gold statue and whoever did not go to their knees and worship it had to be pitched into a roaring furnace well there are some jews here shadrach meshach and abednego whom you have placed in high positions in the province of babylon these men are ignoring you o king they dont respect your gods and they wont worship the gold statue you set up
4855910 is it true shadrach meshach and abednego that you dont respect my gods and refuse to worship the gold statue that i have set up im giving you a second chance but from now on when the big band strikes up you must go to your knees and worship the statue i have made if you dont worship it you will be pitched into a roaring furnace no questions asked who is the god who can rescue you from my power
4855911 your threat means nothing to us if you throw us in the fire the god we serve can rescue us from your roaring furnace and anything else you might cook up o king but even if he doesnt it wouldnt make a bit of difference o king we still wouldnt serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up
4855912 didnt we throw three men bound hand and foot into the fire
4855913 i see four men walking around freely in the fire completely unharmed and the fourth man looks like a son of the gods
4855914 shadrach meshach and abednego servants of the high god come out here
4855915 blessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego he sent his angel and rescued his servants who trusted in him they ignored the kings orders and laid their bodies on the line rather than serve or worship any god but their own
4855916 therefore i issue this decree anyone anywhere of any race color or creed who says anything against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego will be ripped to pieces limb from limb and their houses torn down there has never been a god who can pull off a rescue like this

4855941 im right and you all are wrong on this gray moral issue
4855942 in fact the disgrace of contemporary american catholicism the many recent scandals involving priests and underage boys is traceable to the collusion between a large catholic laity that wanted a different birth control doctrine on the one hand and a new generation of priests cutting themselves a different kind of slack on the other
4855943 i wont tattle on my gay priest if youll give me absolution for contraception
4855944 thus many catholics complain about the dearth of priests all the while ignoring their own responsibility for that outcome the fact that few have children in numbers large enough to send one son to the priesthood while the others marry and carry on the family name

4855955 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4855956 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4855957 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4855958 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4855959 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4855960 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4855961 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4855962 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4855963 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4855964 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
4855965 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4855966 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4855967 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4855968 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4855969 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4855970 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4855971 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4855972 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4855973 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4855974 i think that particular period was unique because it was the beginning of the effective use of mass media by people with an axe to grind of any kind
4855975 it was also fueled by some very new cultural frontiers being breached and that was the drug and the sex aspects of life
4855976 we do still have people who feel opposed and counter but society learned to co opt those people a long time ago it learned that back in the 60s how to turn hippies into marketing tools
4855977 thats what happens with punk or the music of the day any of these things that have a chance of solidifying an opposition are co opted by the culture in its own interest
4855978 i dont think the culture does it consciously to head them off i think it just does it because its good marketing i think most kids in school now are just there to find out how to get a good job because weve become nothing but consumers in this country
4855979 im not even thinking left or right wing any of that kind of stuff
4855980 its disappointing that a species with this magnificent brain and all of the potential we were given by nature to objectify things to be able to speak about things outside of ourselves and to be able to have abstract and conceptual thought these things are wonderful gifts that were squandering
4855981 the balance between cooperation and competition has gotten to a dangerous imbalance competition is now the boss whether its friendly competition in business or whos got the best suburban utility vehicle its just a soulless soul deadening pursuit of goods and power and money and position
4855982 that and this ignorant belief that theres this man up in the sky watching everything is dispiriting and discouraging to me
4855983 praying as a specific democracy and the hypocrisy of all men are created equal a good strong attack on men white people policemen airport security and germs and the slavish devotion to childrens welfare in this country
4855984 i know its entertainment i know im a stand up comedian and i dont shrink from those descriptions but i know theres a process of art at work in interpreting the world and presenting it back to the audience in an altered form
4855985 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4855986 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4855987 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4855988 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4855989 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4855990 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4855991 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4855992 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4855993 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4855994 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4855995 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4855996 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4855997 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4855998 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4855999 as though perhaps only part of me has been here before
4856000 well how else are we going to wake him doctor wake up
4856001 but why would he do that now that were in the tardis
4856002 crizz heard some sort of noise and then we found you like this all sprawled across the panel
4856003 i think the tardis may have managed it for you
4856004 yes that would do it i suppose but really i was having such an odd dream
4856005 for some reason i was back in the garden of curiosities
4856006 but i thought youd never even seen one before how did you know it was an obelat
4856007 charley not every creature in the universe can be captured by mere words
4856008 now that doesnt sound like an obelat no wait maybe it does sort of
4856009 as in the obelat sometimes changes every instant or it simply cant be captured by words
4856010 i think at this point crizz i have no answer might better suffice
4856011 well that excitement over i think now would be a good time to do a bit of tiding up and
4856012 perhaps a cold compress might be in order charley do you think
4856013 i should probably set it aside for now and take a look up there see whats going on with the old girl
4856014 do you think theres something wrong with the tardis again
4856015 incidentally crizz do you think you might fancy a short visit to the zone eutermes assuming we can find it again of course
4856016 i think my subconscious is terribly bothered by the fact that i never got a proper look at an obelat
4856017 it usually isnt but i wonder perhaps my subconscious got a look and created an accurate picture
4856018 you could describe your obelat to me and i could tell you if it was like a real one
4856019 do you think you might be able to draw one given the materials
4856020 i suppose thats an advantage incidentally what exactly does an obelat do to you if not eat you
4856021 places to go creatures to discover what do you think well find at our next destination crizz
4856022 the police showed up almost immediately there were several undercover police trying to take us down and 12 paramilitary police came running
4856023 we were all down within about 30 minutes of going up
4856024 my treatment was smooth i was taken down and had my arm twisted but after that they were very nice to us
4856025 its really great to hear about a vermont activist doing something international thats really making waves
4856026 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
4856027 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
4856028 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4856029 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4856030 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4856031 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4856032 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4856033 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4856034 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4856035 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4856036 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4856037 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4856038 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4856039 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4856040 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4856041 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4856042 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4856043 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4856044 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4856045 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4856046 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4856047 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4856048 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4856049 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4856050 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4856051 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4856052 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4856053 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4856054 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4856055 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4856056 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4856057 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4856058 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4856059 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4856060 el tenista suizo roger federer se colg el oro ol mpico en la modalidad de dobles junto a su compatriota stanislas wawrinka al superar en la final de los juegos de pek n a los suecos simon aspelin y thomas johansson
4856061 dont 8 46 use a valuable password and dont enter any sensitive information
4856062 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4856063 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4856064 qatar as a state of strategic weight in the region seeks to sponsor the mediation between hamas and fatah to end the internal split and reunite the two wings of palestine
4856065 collinsworth is that a cool thing to say in this day and age
4856066 i can understand what you are feeling now the wish that a mother has only wanting her child to be safe and happy now i ask you to erase the hate in your heart to return to where you belong i promise to look after your daughters safety please let go of your pain and hate and return to the underworld

4856071 before survivor i knew there was an issue and i wanted to do something about it but i didnt know what i could do
4856072 when he got back from africa dr clark had the idea and i helped fund it and we went full force after that
4856073 these guys grew up in the same streets went to the same schools and battled the same issues as these kids
4856074 the kids know who they are theyre real life heroes to them
4856075 given pumas rich history in soccer and our continuous support of african football this relationship was a perfect fit for our brand
4856076 the concept of the dribble is also truly unique we could not be happier to support ethan and grassroots soccer on their quest to raise money and awareness for such an important cause
4856077 its pretty cool to have my own ball created by puma
4856078 puma has been a huge help to us they have a strong connection to africa they are sponsors of a dozen or so national teams

4856083 he disputado los ltimos 8 km sobre la llanta estar a contento si ma ana pudiera finalizar tercero he perdido 45 segundos pero no hab a modo de pararse y cambiarla en ese tiempo as que he tomado la decisi n acertada de continuar
4856084 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4856085 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4856086 how can a god of love send anyone to hell
4856087 enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and there are many who enter through it
4856088 for the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to eternal life and there are few who find it
4856089 i can guarantee this truth no one can enter the kingdom of god without being born of water and the spirit
4856090 do not be amazed that i said to you you must be born again

4856097 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4856098 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4856099 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4856100 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4856101 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4856102 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4856103 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4856104 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4856105 she flat out told us if we wanted to vote for barnes you need to vote republican
4856106 im not going to listen to any accusations he may make
4856107 he can make any kind of accusations he wants the fact is i won the election its time to move on
4856108 she tried to put the water hose on it to do what we could do but by that time it was too late
4856109 it was too much fire the water hose wouldnt do nothing
4856110 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
4856111 in the same area on the first floor at the rear
4856112 but the bodies did appear to have some severe burns
4856113 its an incredibly sad day in this industry when people who call themselves gamers decide to attack a game simply for being different and outside the box of mainstream conventions
4856114 we want to provide a legal offering from the studios and it s an easier conversation to have with them now

4856120 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4856121 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4856122 i am helping him with fundraising we have a fundraiser today and i will be with him today and tomorrow
4856123 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4856124 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4856125 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4856126 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4856127 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4856128 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4856129 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4856130 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4856131 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4856132 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4856133 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4856134 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4856135 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4856136 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4856137 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4856138 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4856159 youre from the 51st century where there are no sexual taboos and will proposition anything that smiles at you youve watched owen and gwen shag on the cctv and you dont give a damn who sees us going at it in the hub yet a stuffed monkey puts you off your stride
4856160 i dont know why the stupid monkey is unnerving me so much ive never had a problem with them before
4856161 maybe you know it knows youre trying to steal my virtue

4856167 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4856168 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4856169 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4856170 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

4856174 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4856175 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4856176 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4856177 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4856181 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4856182 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4856183 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4856184 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4856185 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4856186 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4856187 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4856188 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4856189 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4856190 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4856191 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4856192 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4856193 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4856194 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4856195 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4856196 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4856200 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4856201 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4856202 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

4856207 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4856208 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4856209 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4856210 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4856211 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4856212 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4856213 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4856214 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

4856237 the water compact that colorado and other upper basin states have with california and arizona should be renegotiated

4856239 the colorado river compact allocates 7 5 million acre feet of water to california nevada and arizona anything left over is split between colorado utah new mexico and wyoming
4856240 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 percent reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change in the southwest instead of threatening a diminishing resource it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration

4856255 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4856256 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4856257 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4856258 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4856259 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4856260 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4856261 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4856262 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4856263 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4856264 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4856265 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4856266 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4856267 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4856268 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4856269 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4856270 youve got the old spice classic which is loaded and then were at temple at kansas we play

4856272 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4856273 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4856274 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4856275 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4856276 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4856277 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4856278 everyone was grieving for their friends and colleagues who have now left
4856279 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4856280 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4856281 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4856282 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4856283 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4856284 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4856285 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4856286 who are open to doing something on the production side
4856287 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4856288 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4856289 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4856290 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4856291 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4856292 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4856293 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4856294 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4856295 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4856296 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4856297 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4856298 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4856299 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4856300 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4856301 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4856302 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4856303 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4856304 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4856305 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4856306 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4856307 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4856308 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4856309 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4856310 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4856311 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4856312 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4856313 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4856314 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4856315 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4856316 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4856317 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4856318 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4856319 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4856320 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4856321 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4856322 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4856323 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4856324 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4856325 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4856326 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4856327 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4856328 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4856329 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4856330 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4856331 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4856332 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4856333 be fearful when others are greedy be greedy when others are fearful
4856334 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4856335 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4856336 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4856337 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4856338 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4856339 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4856340 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4856341 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4856342 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4856343 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4856344 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4856345 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4856346 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4856393 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4856394 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4856395 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4856396 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4856397 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4856398 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4856399 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4856400 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4856401 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4856402 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4856403 i dont write about my kids very much they are 16 and almost 20 its a privacy thing mostly for me i removed a post i had written about 1 daughter when she had to have her beloved horse put down it was just too close and too raw
4856404 this is why it is useful to actually make an effort to find a job instead of taking the only one that drifted by
4856405 oh i know how hard it is working with young kids all day
4856406 maybe next year you will actually plan your summer in advance
4856407 now you know why a college education is actually a good thing
4856408 how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child
4856409 you are not going to quit that job and do nothing all summer
4856410 but i havent been able to do any of the reading or things i want to do this summer since i have this stupid job
4856411 well guess what thats what people do in the real world they figure out how to work and have hobbies and see their friends all at the same time
4856412 it is three oclock in the morning he has to be up at seven that is four hours of sleep he will probably sleep through his alarm and be late for work i wonder if i should i wake him up tomorrow or let him sleep through his alarm clock if i do succeed in waking him up he will certainly fall asleep on the job and some child will get horribly sunburned or wander down the beach or worse into the ocean on his watch he will get fired he will be happy to be fired and spend the rest of the summer doing nothing never return to school not be able to get another job due to the lack of recommendation or worse the criminal record he will have due to his nap induced negligence and end up in a series of meaningless jobs each worse than the next until he finally ends up like that guy we saw on the way home today the one shuffling across the freeway with his bare feet so dirty that it actually looked as if he had shoes on and his ragged clothes hanging limply off his body i wonder if i should i wake him up tomorrow or let him sleep through his alarm clock and while im at it what can we do if he quits hes over eighteen we cant force him to work or can we i wonder if i should i wake him up tomorrow or let him sleep through his alarm clock
4856413 well dear in my attempt to mother less i will let you make your own pizza

4856423 i came out and i noticed the windows were foggy
4856424 i opened the door and it had a really strong aroma
4856425 the police officer said something was smoking on the seat thats why he called the fire department because its hot and he didnt want it to explode
4856426 was it aimed at me was it aimed at my daughter 18 year old tameka
4856427 or was it just lets find a car and tear it up was it random

4856434 i guess every opening ceremony of the olympic games is amazing but everything ive seen and heard last night is the most dramatic exciting and impressive in the history of the olympic games
4856435 i know the british people also thought it was the most spectacular start to the olympic games
4856436 each time i come back to beijing its amazing how far and how quickly beijing is changing and clearly china is changing there is intense interest in china in the uk and around the world because of the speed of its development
4856437 marks an interesting watershed there is no question china has been more open to foreign media than at any point in the history
4856438 because of the next olympics will be in london in 2012 were interested in every aspect of the beijing olympic games and the evidence so far indicates the quality of the organization is very fine indeed

4856451 i have been fortunate enough to follow the progress of this album over the last few months of its production and as the final mixes of each track arrived i could only be increasingly impressed as the canadian outfit brought it all together fronted by the dynamic voice of the lovely ann burstyn the overall impression was of a band of experienced musicians with a love of progressive music but intentionally or not having a 21st century sound nearer to evanescence than within temptation this is no heavy rock album more melodic rock with a classical and dramatical impression with dark corners and the odd ethnic approach great guitar and keyboards make it a prog rock essential the album ends with a beautiful version of delibes flower duet ideal for burstyns voice mh

4856470 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
4856471 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
4856472 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
4856473 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
4856474 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4856475 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4856476 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4856477 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values

4856485 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
4856486 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
4856487 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
4856488 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
4856489 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia

4856496 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly

4856499 when cale wilder crashed his cessna into dawsons hollow georgia during a thunderstorm it seemed as if another piece of his life had shattered his beloved wife had died and his grieving son daniel had run away yet cale wasnt about to give in to despair finding daniel was all that mattered to cale but his fourteen year old son was convinced that revisiting the place where his mother had spent part of her childhood would fill the aching hole her death had created was it chance or fate that brought cale and daniel to the quiet shelter of miranda sinclairs cottage in the tranquil isolation of her mountain home miranda was a healer who understood that emotional wounds often cut deeper that physical ones reaching out to cale and his troubled son was natural yet with cale miranda sensed the painful memories of her own past returning and a new determination to banish them once and for all for if an open heart was the first step in healing together miranda cale and daniel had begun a journey that would end when they discovered the meaning of family the power of faith and the pure magic of love
4856500 i text miley cyrus a lot we are good friends and she spent the night at my house recently i text everybody on earth

4856503 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
4856504 my name is vermin love supreme and im running for president
4856505 in some ways if you know youre going to lose expressing your true beliefs is more important i think thats what you have with some candidates
4856506 maybe you have an issue that you really care about or you get a story written about you
4856507 winning is a long shot but it is a realistic possibility
4856508 ronald reagan didnt have a great chance of winning when he first started running jimmy carter had very little chance of winning when he first started running
4856509 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades
4856510 it is no longer the party of small government and lower taxes it is a party that very clearly is illustrated by the bush administration that believes in absolute power residing in the executives
4856511 remove our economic security blanket that is costing the american people billions of dollars every month
4856512 the libertarians have actually become much more of a factor
4856513 they win some local elections and the greens win some local elections in small towns but even in a state like georgia where hes most likely to do well i doubt he gets even 5 percent of the vote
4856514 theyre the greatest years america had they were the last years we balanced the budget until nixon if america knew that all of our problems were coming from alcohol they would go dry overnight again
4856515 hes running because this issue is so important to him
4856516 its an attempt to get an issue you care about and give it some life
4856517 i really see successful third parties as correctives to failures of the major parties
4856518 when a major party fails third parties serve as safety valves which alert the major parties about their failures and give them a chance to respond
4856519 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4856520 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4856521 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4856522 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4856523 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4856524 a plan has been hatched to liquidate me and the governor by hired killers because we put in danger the lucrative illegal business of prominent people who are behind the illegal logging activities in the province
4856525 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4856526 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4856527 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4856528 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4856529 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4856530 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4856531 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4856532 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4856533 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4856534 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4856535 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4856536 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4856537 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4856538 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4856539 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4856540 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4856541 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4856542 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4856543 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4856544 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4856545 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4856546 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4856547 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4856548 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4856549 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4856550 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4856551 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4856552 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4856553 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4856554 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4856555 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4856556 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4856557 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4856558 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted me to meet at midnight sunday night id be there
4856559 its the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind and its happening very very fast
4856560 the u s with texas in the lead added more in wind power than the world added in coal power last year
4856561 it is clear that he and i have two very different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4856562 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4856563 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4856564 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4856565 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4856566 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4856567 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4856568 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4856569 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4856570 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4856571 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4856572 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4856573 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4856574 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4856575 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4856576 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4856577 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4856578 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4856579 global warming obesity and heart disease all figments of al gores imagination
4856580 we used to be young but suddenly were not our thighs have gone wide but we used to be hot wubyah wubyah wubyah
4856581 how i stopped raising my children and started raising h
4856582 una mirada al pasado para querer nuestro presente y valorar nuestro futuro
4856583 there should be investment in livestock breeding and management to reduce the footprint needed to produce any given level of meat
4856584 in places where you cant grow grain fattening cows on grass is always going to make more sense
4856585 when you look at environmental problems in the u s
4856586 nearly all of them have their source in food production and in particular meat production and factory farming is optimal only as long as degrading waterways is free if dumping this stuff becomes costly even if it simply carries a non zero price tag the entire structure of food production will change dramatically
4856587 i just dont think we can count on market prices to reduce our meat consumption
4856588 there may be a temporary spike in food prices but it will almost certainly be reversed and then some but if all the burden is put on eaters thats not a tragic state of affairs
4856589 a stronger public relations campaign in the reduction of meat consumption one like that around cigarettes emphasizing personal health compassion for animals and doing good for the poor and the planet
4856590 the good of peoples bodies and the good of the planet are more or less perfectly aligned
4856591 there are reasons for optimism that the conflicting demands for animal products and environmental services can be reconciled both demands are exerted by the same group of people the relatively affluent middle to high income class which is no longer confined to industrialized countries this group of consumers is probably ready to use its growing voice to exert pressure for change and may be willing to absorb the inevitable price increases
4856592 who said people had to eat meat three times a day
4856593 although i was not at the council meeting last monday i took the time
4856594 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4856595 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4856596 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4856597 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4856598 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4856599 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4856600 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4856601 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4856602 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4856603 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4856604 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4856605 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4856606 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4856607 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4856608 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4856609 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4856610 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4856611 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4856612 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4856613 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4856614 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4856615 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4856616 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4856617 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4856618 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4856619 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4856620 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4856621 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4856622 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4856623 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4856624 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4856625 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4856626 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4856627 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4856628 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4856629 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4856630 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4856631 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4856632 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4856633 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4856634 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4856635 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
4856636 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4856637 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4856638 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4856639 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4856640 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4856641 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4856642 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4856643 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4856644 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4856645 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4856646 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4856647 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4856648 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4856649 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4856650 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4856651 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4856652 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4856653 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4856654 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4856655 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4856656 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4856657 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4856658 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4856659 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4856660 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4856661 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4856662 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4856663 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4856664 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4856665 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4856666 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4856667 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4856668 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4856669 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4856670 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4856671 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4856672 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4856673 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4856674 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4856675 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4856676 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4856677 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4856678 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4856679 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4856680 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4856681 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4856682 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4856683 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4856684 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4856685 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4856686 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4856687 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4856688 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4856689 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4856690 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4856691 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4856692 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4856693 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4856694 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4856695 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4856696 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4856697 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4856698 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4856699 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4856700 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4856701 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4856702 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4856703 opre te trecerea tiu c unde nu e moarte nu e nici iubire i totu i te rog opre te doamne ceasornicul cu care ne m suri destr marea

4857250 damn the consequences for anyone who might have an adverse reaction to it
4857251 the biggest political story of 2008 is getting little coverage it involves the collapse of assumptions that have dominated our economic debate for three decades
4857252 since the reagan years free market cliches have passed for sophisticated economic analysis but in the current crisis these ideas are falling one by one as even conservatives recognize that capitalism is ailing
4857253 you know the talking points regulation is the problem and deregulation is the solution
4857254 while frank is a liberal the same cannot be said of ben bernanke the chairman of the federal reserve
4857255 this is the third time in 100 years that support for taken for granted economic ideas has crumbled
4857256 whats striking is that conservatives who revere capitalism are offering their own criticisms of the way the system is working
4857257 while some conservatives now worry about the social and economic impact of growing inequalities stelzer isnt one of them
4857258 frank takes a similar view arguing that ceos benefit substantially if the risks they take pay off
4857259 frank also calls for new thinking on the impact of free trade
4857260 in the presidential campaign so far john mccain has been clinging to the old economic orthodoxy while barack obama has proposed a modestly more active role for government but the economic assumptions are changing faster than the rhetoric of the campaign reality has broken in
4857261 while she was running on the treadmill she was joking about how she doesnt have a man
4857262 how do you make out with a guy while your dad watches
4857263 theres no way that jamie would allow adnan and britney to be alone
4857264 one of the side effects seems to me lack of sexual interest
4857265 before britney began treatment sleeping around with different men could have been the result of the manic state she was in
4857266 i am seeing the results of good psychiatry and good parenting
4857267 right now britney isnt looking for a lover shes looking for a boyfriend
4857268 she really wants a guy that she can cuddle with
4857269 hello im john mccain of arizona and ive come for your water
4857270 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
4857271 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
4857272 i wonder if he is running for president of the united states or for something in arizona when he makes those statements
4857273 im really kind of surprised that someone running for president that needs to carry the state of colorado would make a statement like that
4857274 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
4857275 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
4857276 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
4857277 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
4857278 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
4857279 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
4857280 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
4857281 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
4857282 by creating incidents in jammu noam chomsky would be proud of the indian government
4857283 these slogans are no more audible now people are asking for an end to kashmirs domination over jammu the problem is now no more between the government and the local people on a controversial decision it has been now projected as jammu versus kashmir

4857287 usted cree que en el socialismo debe respetarse la propiedad privada
4857288 esto lo que indica es que el presidente hugo ch vez no ha sido exitoso en su esfuerzo por convencer a los venezolanos de rechazar el capitalismo en la mente de nuestros ciudadanos los dos sistemas capitalismo y socialismo parecen ser totalmente compatibles
4857289 lo que pareciera es que los venezolanos aspiran m s bien a un sistema socialdem crata como se entiende el socialismo en europa brasil chile
4857290 esta es una situaci n diametralmente opuesta a la que vimos en febrero de 2006 cuando 55 prefer a el socialismo y 22 el capitalismo

4857294 as equipes ter o a oportunidade de fazer diferente o que fizeram de errado no primeiro turno o n utico tem condi es principalmente voltando a ganhar dentro de casa e aprendendo a jogar fora para voltar ao recife com esses tr s pontos
4857295 sempre tenho uma conversa olho nos olhos com os t cnicos eu falei pra ele que n o queria voltar para o departamento m dico fiz o trabalho da semana e estou naquela fase de recupera o s com uma fibrose que ainda fica no m sculo
4857296 todo mundo quer o seu espa o e sabe da import ncia de ter um bom resultado e fazer uma boa campanha pelo santa cruz n o podemos pensar em empatar fora para tentar ganhar em casa n o temos que buscar a vit ria fora eu voltei para tentar a vit ria e acho que todo mundo deveria pensar assim veja meu caso eu quis estar aqui tentei e consegui
4857297 esperamos que ele possa fazer uma boa estr ia e que nos ajude a voltar de l com uma vit ria a gente ficou muito satisfeito com a volta dele e ao mesmo tempo um pouco triste por ele estar vindo de um centro de maior destaque como s o paulo esperamos que ele possa se destacar aqui e que isso fa a com que ele ganhe uma nova oportunidade de disputar o campeonato paulista
4857298 foi importante a cidade muito aconchegante e uma forma de reunir mais o grupo a gente fica distante da fam lia mas essa a hora de fazer todo e qualquer sacrif cio para tentar levar o santa cruz vit ria
4857299 temos v rios jogos que s o confrontos diretos nesse come o e que ser o muito importantes se quisermos chegar mais longe temos que ter um in cio bem melhor do que o do primeiro turno para poder encostar no pelot o da frente e tentar beliscar alguma vaga entre os quatro primeiros
4857300 tomamos muitos gols nos in cios e nos finais das partidas temos que corrigir isso entrando mais atentos em campo e conseguindo manter a aten o at o final do jogo
4857301 a ilha do retiro foi a principal arma do sport na copa do brasil e tem que voltar a ferver sempre jogamos muito bem aqui com o apoio da nossa torcida e nesse segundo turno n o pode ser diferente

4857328 te veel spelers haalden niet het gewenste niveau om een strijdlustig anderlecht iets in de weg te leggen toch is de score wat overdreven maar versta me niet verkeerd de overwinning van anderlecht is verdiend
4857329 anderlecht voorzitter van holsbeeck gaf aan dat er een gebrek aan mentaliteit in zijn groep schuilt ja dan komen zulke dingen natuurlijk ter sprake maar het was zeker niet de boeck versus anderlecht
4857330 mijn mentaliteit kan een rol gespeeld hebben maar voetbal is vooreerst een ploegsport dat hebben we vandaag duidelijk gezien we moesten de zege pakken en dat hebben we gedaan

4857333 my experiences in playing ra3 against good players is that the game is slow and who is the winner is who can do the gayest strategy omg pressing f with scorpions takes so much skill so much skill especially considering my dolphins are probably lagged and got killed by a glitch i mean thats just a simple example but its boring when theres an attack force of 3 tanks late game that rocks an entire base
4857334 honestly if you are admitting you arent that good at this game and probably havent figured out much of the strategy to it how can you honestly argue anything
4857335 what we have once enjoyed we can never lose all that we love deeply becomes part of us

4857340 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia it has been made doubly worse as the hiv epidemic is now affecting women at a higher rate than men especially in sub saharan africa we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
4857341 the female condom is the only method that women have to protect themselves it has been embraced in many countries and cultures it works and it is cost effective
4857342 political leadership and funding are needed now no more excuses
4857343 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion than if they deliver that pregnancy

4857346 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts

4857348 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4857349 100 billion is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
4857350 i think advocates of unaccountable privatization are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatization of warmaking on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances of contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
4857351 this magnitude of expenditures on private contractors is especially striking in light of recent government and media reports of dysfunction in the dcaa the protection of the interests of american taxpayers is apparently suffering a number of impediments

4857373 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack

4857380 stewart haas racing has had and will continue to have discussions with numerous people regarding leadership positions within the team including crew chiefs for the nos 4 and 14 teams at this point no decisions have been made in regard to filling those positions
4857381 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that are going to work well together
4857382 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact
4857383 ive seen multicar organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4857384 weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this

4857390 its going to be a very interesting story when the books are opened but if there is an actual shortfall and it is sheeted back to employers we are going to see a substantial increase in acc premiums
4857391 but the concern remains that employers now paying higher rates should be better incentivised to pay lower levies by doing better in health and safety
4857392 but that still leaves a lot of other businesses who are not incentivised
4857393 but this sort of thing doesnt get to the heart of the issue
4857394 they did extremely well last time and then got badly bitten
4857395 there is not a lot of sympathy for the insurance industry in that regard
4857396 doing better within the present system is seen as preferable
4857397 and the concern here seems to be that opening up workers compensation to privatisation may erode the integrity of the schemes

4857437 no entanto as prudentes al m das l mpadas levaram azeite nas vasilhas
4857438 e tardando o noivo foram todas tomadas de sono e adormeceram
4857439 mas meia noite ouviu se um grito eis o noivo sa ao seu encontro
4857440 ent o se levantaram todas aquelas virgens e prepararam as suas l mpadas
4857441 e as n scias disseram s prudentes dai nos do vosso azeite porque as nossas l mpadas est o se apagando
4857442 mas as prudentes responderam n o para que n o nos falte a n s e a v s outras ide antes aos que o vendem e comprai o
4857443 e saindo elas para comprar chegou o noivo e as que estavam apercebidas entraram com ele para as bodas e fechou se a porta

4857532 para ser sincero ya he pasado bastante tiempo entre carreras analizando los datos y manteni ndome en buena forma este descanso veraniego me ha dado la oportunidad de alejarme de eso y centrarme solo en recargar pilas viendo la temporada hasta ahora parece un campeonato distinto al del a o pasado el 2007 fue muy intenso y la consistencia era muy importante este a o los resultados de todos han sido m s variados y todo piloto que ha ganado una carrera tambi n se ha visto incapaz de conseguir puntos en al menos otras dos ocasiones eso hace que conseguir buenos resultados sea a n m s importante pero creo que veremos que la consistencia se hace crucial a medida que avanzamos hacia el final de la temporada
4857533 presentamos el equipo vodafone mclaren mercedes en esa ciudad a comienzos de 2007 y he entrado en el circuito ricardo tormo as que la ciudad no me es desconocida de todas formas ir a un nuevo circuito no cambia mis preparativos todo el mundo est en la misma situaci n as que no lo trato de forma muy diferente por supuesto hemos hecho algunos preparativos en el mclaren technology centre antes de la carrera pero nuestro principal objetivo ser n las tres sesiones libres antes de la calificaci n trabajar estrechamente con mis ingenieros para asegurarnos de que empezamos el fin de semana con una buena base y para trabajar sobre ella durante el fin de semana disfruto visitando nuevos circuitos y estoy deseando meterme en el coche el viernes por la ma ana parece que ser una pista incre ble
4857534 estoy un poco cansado de hacer predicciones la carrera de hungr a demostr lo impredecible que puede ser la f rmula uno y esa es una de las razones por las que es un deporte fascinante est claro sin embargo que a n estoy en buena posici n para luchar por el campeonato del mundo y ese sigue siendo mi objetivo a n confiamos en nuestras posibilidades sabemos que nuestros rivales ser n fuertes pero hemos trabajado mucho para mejorar el coche y confiamos en que seremos competitivos este fin de semana lo m s importante es acabar de forma consistente en los puntos
4857535 he tenido unas vacaciones de trabajo he pasado alg n tiempo en woking con mis ingenieros prepar ndome para este fin de semana y tambi n he pasado alg n tiempo en finlandia en mi pueblo natal suomussalmi donde ayud a organizar la prueba anual de karting en la ciudad fue un evento fant stico para todos despu s de haber ganado el ltimo gran premio ha sido la primera vez que volv a a finlandia desde hace tiempo as que ha sido genial volver como ganador de un gran premio
4857536 la victoria no cambia mucho en realidad a n creo que estoy mejorando y aprendiendo m s del equipo y del coche en cada carrera mi objetivo para la ltima parte de la temporada es ganar m s carreras y estar habitualmente entre los primeros es algo que he podido hacer algunas veces en la primera mitad del a o pero ahora me siento m s seguro de poder estar regularmente entre los primeros en las pr ximas carreras
4857537 parece bastante r pido te acostumbras a que los circuitos urbanos son lentos con muchas curvas lentas y medias y rectas muy cortas pero este es casi lo contrario hay muchas curvas y eses r pidas un par de rectas buenas y muchas zonas r pidas es demasiado pronto para decir si habr oportunidades de adelantamiento pero hay un par de horquillas donde podr a ser posible

4857545 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4857546 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4857547 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4857548 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4857549 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4857550 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4857551 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps

4857570 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4857571 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time

4857574 het is een bizar jaar hou ik mijzelf maar voor maar ik weet dat dat onzin is want collega ron linker heeft een marathon gelopen en die is ook druk op twee blokken van mijn huis is een sportschool daar ben ik nog voor mijn eerste werkdag lid geworden goede voornemens immers aan de omstandigheden lag het niet elke fiets loopband een eigen schermpje meestal ging ik om een uur of 19 zodat ik tijdens het lopen naar het nieuws kon kijken drie kwartier geen idee hoeveel mijl maar na hooguit vijf keer heb ik er de brui aangegeven na een slapend lidmaatschap van enkele maanden heb ik me onlangs lid af gemaakt
4857575 zoals dat ik liever aan teamsporten doe maar me niet aan een vaststaand wekelijks tijdstip kan binden dat ik vreselijk gezond eet wat klopt en ongebruikelijk na een jaar amerika nog niet ben aangekomen dat ik me heb voorgenomen om volgende week eindelijk gebruik te maken van de tennisbaan waar ik iedere dag langsloop om een oude hobby weer op te pakken dat de nba finals en het ek voetbal de zin om zelf ook wat te gaan doen hebben aangewakkerd
4857576 het is ook allemaal waar maar het is een zwaktebod ik doe het niet en ik vind heel eigenwijs dat ik er dit jaar eigenlijk geen tijd voor heb wat ook weer een zwaktebod is mijn goede voornemens beginnen niet op 1 januari 2009 maar op 5 november 2008 een dag na de verkiezingen maar dat duurt nog even eerst de olympische spelen ik ben bang dat dit in een rubriek die over sport gaat de cut niet haalt
4857577 de eerste les met bruine band tenminste de eerste les als volwassene 25 jaar geleden had ik ook een bruine band toen deed ik ook mee aan toernooien in mooie verre buitenlanden en ik won ook wedstrijden dichtbij huis alhoewel ik altijd op beslissing verloor van peter vissers van jkn de andere judoclub uit tilburg
4857578 ik deed rustig met judo omdat ik vanmiddag met een paar ouders en zonen gezaalvoetbald heb twee uur lang de paasjes waren in gedachte overigens net iets mooier dan in werkelijkheid soms kwam er een bal op een fantastische manier op een plek maar dat was toeval
4857579 squashen met de jongens en dan misschien net als gisteren een uurtje spinnen belachelijk afmattende bezigheid maar toch fijn soms zit ik een uur op te harde muziek te veel te zweten dan ga ik naar een andere plek in de fitness club crosstraining met koptelefoon op naar de televisie kijken drie of vier keer zie en hoor ik dan de herhaling van onze dagjournaals en dat van de
4857580 lag bijna op het hockeyveld in tilburg en wijde omgeving toen kwamen de paasje swel waar ik ze wilde hebben alleen begrepen mijn teamgenoten ze niet altijd van achterin het veld speelde ik de bal hoog over iedereen heen naar voren een scoop heet dat toen ik voor de sportredactie van omroep brabant kon gaan werken ben ik me meer met journalistieke scoops bezig gaan houden gek genoeg werden die scoops ook niet altijd begrepen
4857581 voor omroep brabant ging ik naast hockey voetbal korfbal en turnen ook verslag doen van echt bijzondere sporten de denktriatlon dammen schaken en bridgen prachtige sport verslag van het open nederlands kampienschap in 1989 in schijndel of het beugelen groot in zuidoost brabant een grote bal ergens doorheen zien te krijgen maar voornamelijk bedoeld om glaasjes oude jenever te drinken als ik teruglees hoeveel ik sport en gesport heb dan kan het niet anders zijn dat ik er ook heel sportief uitzie gek genoeg heb ik toch voornamelijk het figuur van een beugelinternational in zijn nadagen
4857582 ik doe te weinig maar wanneer ik kan trap ik tegen een balletje op een pleintje
4857583 wat ik zo leuk vind aan die sport scoren natuurlijk ik ben een echte spits niet echt technisch maar voor de goal weet ik altijd wat ik moet doen ik was ook erg snel vroeger ben nu met de leeftijd 38 wat trager
4857584 tennis heb ik vroeger erg veel gedaan ik was zelfs gediplomeerd tennisleraar en zaalvoetbal vroeger in mijn studententijd in utrecht ik was topscorer van entre nous

4857586 prison break is cool en nu kijk ik naar jericho over een dorpje in de vs na een atoombom aanval
4857587 vanaf mijn 6e voetbalde ik in heemstede bij rch dat in die tijd een betaald voetbal organisatie was ik speelde meestal in het op 1 na hoogste team bij deze club in de jeugd dan
4857588 met redelijk succes een paar keer op het allerhoogste nivo uitgekomen en ook voor het haarlems team met als hoogtepunt dat ik werper was op een groot internationaal toernooi en won van een amerikaans legerteam de hanau hornets dat was de eerste keer ooit dat een nederlands team een amerikaans team versloeg
4857589 ik was een redelijke werper en een redelijke slagman het woord redelijk komt vaak in mijn sportcarri re voor nooit absolute top maar daar net onder wel was ik op heel jonge leeftijd 10 12 jaar een talentvol wedstrijdzwemmer lag elke dag zon beetje in het zwembad en vond dat leuk had de latere zwemverslaggever harry vriend als coach en boekte aardige successen
4857590 helaas werden mijn ogen in die tijd steeds slechter en aangezien contactlenzen nog niet geschikt waren voor mij en moest ik zwemmen met een bril anders zag ik helemaal niets en dat is lastig bij bijvoorbeeld de keerpunten ondanks het talent ben ik daar mee opgehouden en mij toe gaan leggen op die andere sporten
4857591 dus ben ik voor de lol gaan hardlopen bij de atletiekvereniging in het dorp dit doe ik als het enigszins kan 2 keer per week anderhalf uur met veel genoegen alhoewel het deze zomer er niet echt van komt in verband met ek en olympische spelen
4857592 er zit op technisch en taktisch gebied zoveel in met name het honkbal in de vs volg ik op de voet ik kan het slechts volgen via mijn digitale zender nasn waar ik graag iets extras voor betaal daarnaast ben ik gek op voetbal en atletiek en heb doordat ik eenmaal de tour mocht verslaan veel interesse in wielrennen
4857593 wat betreft het kijken en luisteren naar sport ben ik een veelvraat als het op radio of tv is kijk ik ernaar bijna alle sporten alleen korfbal vind ik minder en ook van boksen ben ik niet echt gecharmeerd jammer vind ik het dat cricket niet vaker op tv komt met name testwedstrijden van engeland australi en zuid afrika kan ik uren volgen prachtig om te zien

4857598 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
4857599 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
4857600 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
4857601 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states

4857901 the geisha sleep in certain positions so as not to disturb their elaborate hairdos and thats what i was just doing

4857903 finally i got up and read my bible i figured that would put me to sleep

4857935 i dont sleep with him any more john hes older than me hes older than you
4857936 i cant explain the honor of having two quotes on your profile it gives one the sense that they are going to be somebody wow
4857937 can i suck some of your blood so that i can be a pirate
4857938 if i was bored and had a lot of spare time i would count how many pictures of lauren duncan i had on my computer
4857939 i dont feel comfortable with you saying that and wearing those shorts
4857940 hey lance was telling me about this job at the hospital they charge you nine dollars an hour
4857941 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
4857942 adoption of domesticates and domestic technologies by indigenous populations and the local domestication of some endemic species
4857943 die kugel schlug aus diesem winkel in seinen sch del
4857944 o your criticism is invalid because you dont understand what you are criticizing
4857945 i simply stipulate that i will not allow you to have knowledge at this point on your knowledge is now void becasue i declare to be so since its religion and religion is stupid
4857946 its very good that were getting it because up until now if we had a family where somebody was in a wheelchair we had to carry them in
4857947 we had that happen like three weeks ago with a woman who couldnt get up the stairs so this will be something very good for everyone
4857948 coming to the center it can be traumatic anyway but when your mommy cant come in with you its even worse
4857949 we dont set them once a month once every six months once a year if theres a need and we can get out the people to do it we do it
4857950 when something like this comes up its a no brainer
4857951 any other projects we may do are based off the needs in our communities so each one has a certain area like oak grove or purvis
4857952 but these abuse prevention centers those are the focus for all exchange clubs
4857953 the favre foundation paid a lot of money to help get this house
4857954 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4857955 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4857956 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4857957 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4857958 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4857959 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4857960 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4857961 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4857962 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4857963 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4857964 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4857965 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4857966 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4857967 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4857968 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4857969 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4857970 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4857971 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4857972 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4857973 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4857974 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4857975 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4857976 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4857977 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4857978 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4857979 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4857980 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4857981 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4857982 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4857983 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4857984 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4857985 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4857986 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4857987 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

4858006 the residents are very reluctant to vacate dilapidated buildings since they fear living in the transit camp will end their tenancy rights hence most of the tenants are living on the edge in these old buildings
4858007 we need both the parties to come together and will now pursue this issue with the state government
4858008 the tenants stand to lose their rights besides they cannot afford rents for alternate accommodation while the old building is being redeveloped we have asked bmc officials to pay for them so that they get an incentive to move on

4858018 we then brought some of these artists to c o pop last year and sent some of our musicians to south east asia they got into the recording studios last year and the asian pacific plate is the result of that interaction

4858036 plane crazy is a very personal story about the challenges that women face as they are pulled between the demands of motherhood and opportunities of a career
4858037 i set plane crazy in the america of the 1960s the optimism and spirit of those times has always appealed to me and it gave me an opportunity to really explore my four favorite aspects of that decade the emergence of feminism the dawn of the jet age the golden age of advertising and the general explosion of pop art and culture writing it was a real labor of love and seeing it come to life on the stage is incredibly rewarding
4858038 set against the backdrop and glamour of the swinging 60s jet age the intersection between the dawn of transatlantic airline travel the introduction of the pill the genesis of the modern feminist movement and the golden age of advertising a time in history when stewardesses represented an exclusive sorority of women with the freedom to choose their careers and their sexual partners

4858043 in fact to the best of our knowledge no one has ever used frequent flyer miles as an incentive on broadway before we believe that this will open up a whole new channel in the arts for using the worlds most popular and powerful incentive miles and points for rewarding loyal theater and concert goers

4858065 te veel spelers haalden niet het gewenste niveau om een strijdlustig anderlecht iets in de weg te leggen toch is de score wat overdreven maar versta me niet verkeerd de overwinning van anderlecht is verdiend

4858709 raising taxes will ultimately hurt consumers by forcing them to pay even higher gas prices and republicans will oppose them
4858710 largely more of the same failed proposals theyve been trotting out for months
4858711 designed to give political cover to vulnerable democrats who are losing ground
4858712 the democratic leadership should bring up a clean bill give the members a chance to vote up or down on whether or not we should proceed with offshore drilling and not insert any legislative poison pills
4858713 those would be provisions that they know will never be enacted and are added only for the purpose of killing the effort to open up the outer continental shelf to drilling
4858714 rehashes washed up garbage that didnt have the ability to pass this house and theyre going to try to couple that with limited offshore production

4858726 this team has grown a lot and there are still a lot of young players in here so were going to be fine
4858727 i think were going to be right there towards the end of the season and i cant wait
4858728 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number sunday for somebody to win the tournament
4858729 i told my caddie if i made this i would get in the bunker and do a snow angel

4858736 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4858737 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4858738 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4858739 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4858740 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4858741 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4858742 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4858743 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4858744 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4858745 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4858746 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4858747 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4858748 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4858749 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4858750 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4858751 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4858752 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4858753 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4858754 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4858755 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4858756 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4858757 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4858758 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4858759 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4858760 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4858761 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4858762 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4858763 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4858764 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4858765 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4858766 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4858767 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4858768 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4858769 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4858770 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4858771 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4858772 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4858773 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4858774 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4858775 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4858776 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4858777 she tried to put the water hose on it to do what we could do but by that time it was too late
4858778 it was too much fire the water hose wouldnt do nothing
4858779 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
4858780 in the same area on the first floor at the rear
4858781 but the bodies did appear to have some severe burns
4858782 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4858783 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4858784 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4858785 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4858786 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4858787 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4858788 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4858789 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4858790 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4858791 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4858792 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4858793 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4858794 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4858795 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4858796 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4858797 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4858798 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4858799 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4858800 this is a planning took where all things are going
4858801 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4858802 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4858803 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4858804 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4858805 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4858806 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4858807 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4858808 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4858809 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4858810 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4858811 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4858812 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4858813 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4858814 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4858815 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4858816 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4858817 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4858818 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4858819 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4858820 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4858821 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4858822 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4858823 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4858824 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4858825 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4858826 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4858827 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4858828 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4858829 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4858830 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4858831 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4858832 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4858833 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4858834 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4858835 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4858836 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4858837 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4858838 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4858839 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4858840 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4858841 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4858842 the ultimate goal is to clone the genes needed to produce lsd psilocybin thc dmt and others into common pests and then spread them around the globe to allow everyone the freedom of choice unlimited access to drugs should end that moronic war on drugs so that all the money now happily appropriated by a band of useless parasites can be spent on drug research and education substances like lsd offer everyone a chance of becoming a better human being more aware of themselves with better understanding of reality and most importantly with much more control over their lives then standard social imprinting which we all undergo during growing up allows i consider banning lsd and related compounds one of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed
4858843 i know what happens to you when you get old
4858844 she appears briefly in his american psycho and plays a major role in his lesser known glamorama its this literary journalistic parallel thats sort of making us insane since we know so little about rielle hunter and the true story of her relationship with edwards we are free to imagine all sorts of things it sometimes seems like thats what the enquirer is doing though at other times their reporting seems all too real in an oddly parallel way ellis took creative freedom with rielle in his writing turning her at times into a victim and into a monster
4858845 shes the coke addled sex fiend girlfriend of a jealous club owner who happens to also be sleeping with the protagonist of the novel victor ward who is a model and promoter

4858851 you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink
4858852 we smart change agents can tell people about our brilliant ideas but we cant make them adopt the ideas

4858860 i dont sit around and think about that all day
4858861 for what worrying doesnt do nothing but give you gray hair
4858862 i dont want to say yes no and jinx myself i dont know
4858863 i use that as my motivation just because i take some of the negative things out that ive been going through and try to put it on the football field thats probably why i seem a little more aggressive this year
4858864 some will tell you that if you have too much depth youre not good anywhere i feel like weve got some guys that we can move in and out of there
4858865 i just paid two billion for him to learn a lesson after the after action report it was apparent that he had learned something and that i might as well be the one who benefits from it i paid for the experience after all

4858870 proprietary software companies such as microsoft corp have tried to stop the adoption of open source software by various governments around the world last november the initiative for software choice a coalition backed by big industry giants such as microsoft and intel sent a letter to the director of the office of information technology at the ministry of science and technology arturo gallegos warning the venezuelan government against adopting open source software

4858887 whats the difference between sexual harassment and just being an idiot if my father didnt harass my mother i wouldnt be here anita hill started this whole thing if clarence thomas looked like denzel washington this would never have happened when an ugly man wants some you call the police
4858888 we men have decided that it is womens role and only womens role to raise the children even though we want children as much as you do we men will take no part whatsoever in the role of childrearing
4858889 we will never acknowledge when you do well in your role of caring for children
4858890 it is your role and your role alone to initiate sexual relationships even though women want them as much as you do
4858891 men in the fantasy model are always rewarded for not listening to a woman rather than taking her seriously is it any wonder that men in the real world have trouble knowing what to do when a woman says no or stop
4858892 one third of women consistently tell researchers that on at least one occasion they have said no to sex when what they really meant was yes liberated women are as likely to do this as are women who accept traditional gender roles
4858893 i didnt like him at first now im in love
4858894 i am a professional single attractive woman in my late 20s two years ago i met a wealthy man i did not encourage him but he pursued me relentlessly and was very persistent i finally gave in
4858895 no one has yet been found guilty of sexual harassment for a tip of the hat but charges are certainly being filed on increasingly flimsy grounds
4858896 just about anything can count as a hostile environment depending on whos defining the terms
4858897 any initiative even one could make her feel uncomfortable and therefore create a hostile environment and that is all she needs to have her lawsuit upheld
4858898 too easy a leap from discrimination on the basis of gender to the false assumption that any sexual reference to or about a woman or in the presence of a woman is sexist i find that absolutely contrary not only to free speech but to womens equality one thing i discovered in doing research for my book was the shocking extent to which although our legal system has so far without any dissension rejected the catharine mackinnon andrea dworkin argument in the context of pornography laws it has accepted their world view through the trojan horse of sexual harassment law and practice their view boils down to sex is inherently degrading to women so any sexual image or reference is harassment
4858899 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
4858900 sticks and stones may break my bones but mere words have the power to utterly destroy me
4858901 the law says that you are protected against religious harassment if we were to transpose the overly broad concept of any sexual reference to a woman as sexual harassment then what about an employee talking about gay rights or reproductive freedom in front of an employee whos a fundamentalist they could say that its religious harassment at work

4858903 for any little thing my seating stool was not in the proper groove or i was too long in the rest room
4858904 at the present time he is suspended for exposing himself to the class
4858905 the assumption that women in the workplace can be sexually harassed by male peers or even subordinates catharine mackinnon argues the fact that being a man gives you so much more power that women need special rules that is like saying that women who are in a position of power arent really their power and their authority is so fragile that a dirty joke by a man can puncture all their years of hard work i find that offensive
4858906 theres no doubt about the fact that the climate has been counterproductive
4858907 it limits womens opportunities although nobody will admit to it managers are afraid to give travel assignments to women late night assignments work behind closed doors we are in danger of reinstituting the protective laws of the early 20th century that we were so proud of getting rid of in the name of equality
4858908 you learn your best lessons from the mistakes you make
4858909 but someone must be willing to sit down with you and tell you that youve screwed up now we have created a situation with the deadly cocktail of affirmative action eeoc lawsuits and sexual harassment lawsuits in which people are increasingly unwilling to tell women what they are doing or have done wrong because it creates a paper trail in the long run this will be a huge impediment to womens advancement
4858910 mccarthy has said that the overly broad concept of sexual harassment as all speech with sexual connotations has made even her an avowed feminist fearful of hiring women
4858911 i ask women in my audiences who had entered the workplace when single and later gotten married to raise your hand if you married a man you met at work or through a workplace contact a client or someone to whom you were a client almost two thirds raised their hands another 15 percent of these women lived with or had a long relationship with a man they met while on the job but never married him
4858912 if i gush at a guy zowee youre as handsome as brad pitt and he doesnt pick up on that by talking to me and sooner or later suggesting lunch or something i figure hes telling me to forget it hes clearly saying no to me
4858913 does she have the hots for me or is she just making an observation about my looks
4858914 is she setting me up to come on to her so she can charge sexual harassment and tap the company for big bucks for being offended
4858915 ill spot a good looking guy in a coffee shop at the bookstore or in a bar and will immediately pretend he isnt there my thought if hes attracted to me and looking to meet someone new hell say something
4858916 if she has never expressed interest in me and then still expressed no interest after i showed interest in her she clearly isnt attracted
4858917 when men talk dirty to women its sexual harassment but when women talk dirty to men its 6 95 a minute
4858918 and the lord said to abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward for all thee land thou seest to thee i will give it and to thy seed for ever
4858919 you are the lord god who chose abram and brought him out of ur of the chaldeans and named him abraham you found his heart to be faithful to you and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendents the land of canaanites hittitites amorites perizzites jebusites and girgashites you have kept your promise because you are righteous
4858920 you found his heart to be faithful to you and
4858921 was already been fulfilled by god and not to be fulfilled in the future as zionist jew and evangelist propagandists want christians to believe
4858922 the true promised land is not the present day israel but soon to descend holy city of god new jerusalem they jews and evangelists fail to see that the true promised land is not a parcel of land in the middle east but the city from above the one true faith believing descendents of abraham were looking forward to hebrews 11 10 16 12 22 13 14 they were not looking forward to resurrection unto life to dwell in earthly old jerusalem the patriarchs were looking forward to a spirit infused resurrection from the grave to dwell inside new jerusalem the headquarters for the heavenly kingdom of god which will dwell on earth for eternity
4858923 all social regeneration and political freedom must finally depend on something that has a deeper meaning in life and that if you will allow me to say so is islam and islamic spirit in the pursuit of truth and cultivation of beliefs we should be guided by our rational capitals mine interpretation of the quran and our devotion to truth is single minded we shall in our own measure achieve our goal
4858924 pollard had supposedly given israel a list of every american spy inside the soviet union
4858925 israels founding the last colonial power on earth is a testament to the historical transformation of the passive persecuted jew to the most powerful political nation on earth
4858926 the armed ikhwan organization muslim brotherhood is a story fabricated by nasser regime its incumbent on muslims to establish the islamic state when in majority and make call to it as the prophet muhammad pbuh and his companion did this should be ideal of every muslim be he an ikhwan or a non ikhwan
4858927 the next day of sayyid qutbs hanging as i was invoking allah i fell asleep and heard in dream someone telling that sayyid is in the seventh heaven
4858928 o zianab youre following the right path of allah and his prophet
4858929 look we told you so islam is not compatible with democracy even muslim leaders are saying so

4858937 players are driven into thinking that the champions league is the be all and end all it really isnt i tell you
4858938 you dont mind if your top player is in control its when your mediocre player is in control
4858939 im not talking about any player in particular im just talking about the state of the game in general
4858940 in my day the players had no power whatsoever and you always felt you were hard done by and that no one was there to support you in our day we yearned for a halfway house but now it has gone miles in the other direction
4858941 at forest we won the european cup twice and those days were fantastic but it was the league competition the 42 matches we played in that that was everything thats what you lived for every single saturday
4858942 there wasnt one person at villa myself the chairman especially the fans who would have wanted to see gareth leave and go to liverpool or anywhere else

4858960 says things i dont agree with in a non fawning tone of voice
4858961 stewart haas racing has had and will continue to have discussions with numerous people regarding leadership positions within the team including crew chiefs for the nos 4 and 14 teams at this point no decisions have been made in regard to filling those positions
4858962 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that are going to work well together
4858963 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact
4858964 ive seen multicar organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4858965 weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this
4858966 joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people

4859020 the words people of the united states and citizens are synonymous terms and mean the same thing they both describe the political body who according to our republican institutions form the sovereignty and who hold the power and conduct the government through their representatives they are what we familiarly call the sovereign people and every citizen is one of this people and a constituent member of this sovereignty the question before us is whether the class of persons described in the plea in abatement compose a portion of this people and are constituent members of this sovereignty we think they are not and that they are not included and were not intended to be included under the word citizens in the constitution and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the united states on the contrary they were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings who had been subjugated by the dominant race and whether emancipated or not yet remained subject to their authority and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the government might choose to grant them

4859077 hannah would come to recast richard in her mind as an impregnable figure of destiny bringer of miracles when he became famous she began to report that richard had been born the day of an eclipse he wasnt that his ragged and forlorn family had sold land upon which oil was found immediately afterward they hadnt the exaggerations she got away with drove home for her son the lesson that a lie unexposed does no harm that a soul viewed as a saint can also lie and her swooning though she withheld praise in his presence drove home a lesson the politician was predisposed to internalize that he was a figure of destiny impregnable
4859078 the thirty six year old hamilton never shrank from a maiden in distress as maria reynolds must have known
4859079 that encounter was the first of many times that alexander hamilton slipped furtively through the night to see reynolds once eliza had gone off to albany the coast was clear to bring his mistress home i had frequent meetings with her most of them at my own house
4859080 it is baffling that hamilton having worked to achieve a spotless reputation as a treasury secretary did not see that he was now courting danger and would be susceptible to blackmail yet he was in the grip of a dark sexual compulsion and maria reynolds knew how to hold him fast in her toils by feigning love there seems little question that she approached hamilton as part of an extortion racket delivering an adept performance as a despairing woman

4859092 what does it take to keep church leaders enthused about their careers
4859093 obviously there is a need in the professional ministry at large for seminars that teach leadership skills mentoring and the many ways to achieve a more successful and satisfying family life style
4859094 sixty percent of the retired spiritual leaders interviewed those who had had successful careers said that much of their success was due to the sage advice and regular coaching they received from their personal mentors
4859095 leadership involves far more than promoting programs and making speeches and since no one can predict what crises will happen over the next four years it is vital to know the decision capacity and process of each man

4859111 in a match for the united states championship the champion shelton benjamin defended against jeff hardy this match just like last week is my favorite match of the entire night i mean you can see the athletisism and agility between them when jeff hardy had the match won mvp for the third time interfered in the match giving hardy the win by dq but this time it backfired as hardy nailed mvp with a twist of fate then nailed both him and the gold standard with swanton bombs this has to be a fine tune up match for jeff hardy going into summerslam and i also believe that mvp just got a taste of what is in store for him at summerslam jeff hardy is ready for mvp this sunday
4859112 then in a divas tag team match maria and the divas champion michelle mccool took on maryse and natayla the all american champion and her partner had the match in control until mccool was distracted by maryse one too many times allowing natalya to score the pinfall for both her and maryse i think that natalya might be sending mccool a message in terms of a possible rematch for the divas championship in which mccool defeated her for at the great american bash
4859113 then the so called future of sports entertainment the brian kendrick took on newcomer scotty goldman and gets his advisor ezekial jackson to utter his first words to the smackdown audience i was actually impressed with the fact he can talk goldman was pretty impressive in his smackdown debut but kendrick picked up the win then after the match jackson gave his own physical form of advisement kendrick is the future huh well he is the future of any movie that would be inspired by brokeback mountain
4859114 then one week after suffering a deadly vice grip at the hands of the great khali the wwe champion triple h took on kenny dykstra the game sent a message back to the great khali with authority when he made quick work of dykstra things got out of hand after the match when the game took into the khalis translator runjin singh to the ring to entice his mammoth challenger into the it even though the game failed to nail khali with a pedigree for the second week in a row he gave the punjabi giant a message of his own when he knocked his challenger off his feet and out of the ring i know for sure that triple h has found his stride and will take down the great khali at summerslam
4859115 the big show has been a strong force in the wwe ever since his return earlier this year and last night he was definetly wreaking havoc as he sent a brutal welcome to newcome ryan braddock if he keeps piling up the victories he will be back up in the title hunt
4859116 then the moscow mauler vladimir kozlov who has been searching for better competition has found what he was looking for when he took on the corn fed colossus festus festus truly gave him a real good run for the money then when it looked like festus had the match won kozlov came back and nailed him with his headbutt from the east giving him the win and saving his undefeated streak kozlov was not in a wrestling match he was in a fierce battle
4859117 we are facing the threat of wipe out i have not left this town in three years because of the danger the situation here was like a bowl without a base for christians we were just tossed around by establishing our own security we have the chance to stand steady again

4859122 as most of you know i have been involved in music production for over 16 years it is my passion and what drives me i have been involved with many different genres and fortunate enough to keep an open mind to most i have honestly seen just about anything there is to see it is really refreshing when you see a new band come around that can really grab you the situation is one of those bands i am confident that this band will go places they have all of the elements they would need to make it in the harsh music business i have had the privilege to work with them a hand full of times and they amaze me each time they put on a show they are what i would call a jam band and honestly can get just about anyone dancing they make you feel good when you listen to their music everyone of their songs has catchy rhythms and were well thought out and put together the band is super tight also i find myself singing their songs in the shower and a few of them are daily stuck in my head i am confident that the situation can go up and down the california coast and be a hit at any club bar or party they play at they are a perfect california and coastal band the best thing about this band is all of the members are very cool and personable i feel the biggest downfall about popular up and coning local bands is they get a big head and forget how they got there this band is the real deal and is cool with everyone when the situation plays everyone at the show are friends even if they dont know one another i do not personally promote many bands however i would be happy to promote this band even if they were not playing at my place

4859133 while rankings are not the sole measure of success we like to see consistent quality and positive growth

4859143 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4859144 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4859145 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4859146 these questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict

4859216 examining the manner in which african and western writers defined their societal identity by articulating the selfs relationship to a societal other reveals that the radically different context in which their societies experienced that other manifests itself in the distinctly different paradigms of societal identification that we find in african and western literature
4859217 distinguishing the guiding principles of african literature from the western literary tradition has been one of the most important tasks of critics of african literature from the initial emergence of african writing to the present

4859230 yet acta proponents seem bent on having a treaty in place by the end of the year how can appropriate outcomes be achieved with such indecent haste
4859231 we are very worried about leaked discussion documents relating to acta which would force isps to disclose customer information and even disconnect anyone alleged to be an infringer based on untested and intrusive technological tracking without warrant or judicial oversight
4859232 whether acta ends up seeing ipods and laptops searched at international airports as some are proposing we cant say but we cannot allow it to undermine the balance that exists in our laws
4859233 also what is meant by commercial scale infringement is not clear acta may redefine anyone with an unauthorised copy of a song to be regarded as a criminal without the minimal protections and subject to disproportionate penalties that go beyond what is legally fair in australia
4859234 we already have new and far reaching legislation that covers off the illegal distribution of digital sound and video recordings via the internet
4859235 we strongly urge the australian government to adopt a cautious approach before committing to any sweeping measures as part of acta

4859250 we want to thank all the united states personnel and png soldiers who finished this project so that our children can continue their education and add values to their lives
4859251 when we got here these crews worked long days and often times through difficult obstacles where it was very easy to forget why we were here
4859252 however it was the faces of the children and their smiles that reminded us the kind of impact that we could have in this country

4859278 staying honest when i am creating an image or writing means having to sit with and work through nervousness tension anger fear and ultimately my limitations my art is my way of naming demons of finally standing up for myself for finally letting the past pass

4859301 i am sure they australia remember the loss to bangladesh in 2005 and they will come hard at us
4859302 we are an improving side and the objective remains the same here also we have shown in the past that if we get to scores in the region of 250 then we can put pressure on the opposition

4859395 thats how eliminationist hate works regardless of its target its aim is to threaten and intimidate not merely the immediate target but anyone who might think of speaking out on their behalf
4859396 its a fairly self explanatory term it describes a kind of politics and culture that shuns dialogue and the democratic exchange of ideas for the pursuit of outright elimination of the opposing side either through complete suppression exile and ejection or extermination
4859397 a call for action on behalf of the victims of homosexuality
4859398 sooner or later this violence is going to spread to whites

4859404 i dont read headlines on the day of the game but my commitment is 100 with the fans with the players and with the club in general i say 100 times my family is happy here we want to win trophies at this club because it is a massive club
4859405 if we have problems because we are not doing things which in my opinion as a manager we could do i will work as hard as i can for the club
4859406 i will not talk about any player but in april i was talking about this behind the scenes
4859407 we tried to do things in confidentiality but sometimes you cannot and you need to explain before the end of the transfer window if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money then we have to make the right decisions in terms of whom we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
4859408 having added strength up front is a situation i really enjoy
4859409 ideally i like to operate with four experienced strikers as we did when we won the treble when we had andy cole dwight yorke teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer
4859410 fifpro is in disagreement with the decision of fifas dispute resolution chamber condemning the romanian footballer adrian mutu to pay an amount of over 17 million euros as financial compensation to his former club chelsea after he was caught in a doping test in september 2004 for using cocaine for which reason he was dismissed
4859411 fifpro will assist mutu when the romanian player will lodge an appeal
4859412 when the same offence would have been committed by a player in possession of an english passport than this player wouldnt have had to pay any damages at this dismissal since the fa premier league rules do not provide this
4859413 for this reason this can be considered as discrimination based on nationality
4859414 it is extremely strange that a player who is dismissed by a club must pay damages based on the transfer amount previously paid for him whilst he has had no control whatsoever on the amount of this fee

4859458 i feel extremely proud to be a chinese cheerleader and it is a special honour to perform with the spaniards in the international troupe
4859459 i dont think chinese audiences are that conservative anymore and their thinking about this kind of thing is already rather liberated
4859460 the chinese cheerleaders are all beautiful girls wearing fashionable bikinis and this is probably the first time theyve appeared in public in such highly revealing clothes
4859461 we used to watch bikini scenes in foreign movies now i can see that our women are very open and fashionable
4859462 it was not unlike agatha christies thriller murder on the orient express in which if one looked hard enough everybody aboard the train had a motive for the murder

4859469 india is not a place for mid level professionals you cant implement changes yo ur suggestions are not taken seriously in that sense its a good place to come back as ceo
4859470 in india you only do actual technical work in the first few years after which youre moved to the so called managerial role the degree may vary but on the whole as techies youre half baked and as managers youre a disaster

4859479 i can deliver the package and get the job done
4859480 i admire a company like ups that does a lot for both the fans and the community very much like aaa both sponsors do a lot more than just putting their name on the car
4859481 tell people something they know already and they will thank you for it tell them something new and they will hate you for it
4859482 in news the rule is that liberals will watch the news and conservatives will watch conservative news a liberal will watch to see what you think the conservative will watch to see how much you agree with him this is why the headline world is so far to the right even of the content
4859483 the sneakiest form of literary subtlety in a corrupt society is to speak the plain truth the critics will not understand you the public will not believe you your fellow writers will shake their heads
4859484 the people of have been led in into a trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and honour they have been tricked into it by a steady withholding of information the communiques are belated insincere incomplete things have been far worse than we have been told our administration more bloody and inefficient that the public knows we are today not far from a disaster

4859489 kita tidak bisa memungkiri bahwa salah satu penyebab rawannya trafficking di indonesia dan beberapa negara berkembang lainnya adalah kemiskinan yang masih melilit bangsa ini
4859490 alhamdulillah di indonesia kini ada undang undang uu no 21 2007 tentang pemberantasan tindak pidana perdagangan orang dengan uu ini pemerintah bersama rakyat diharapkan bisa memerangi trafficking di tanah air
4859491 namun saya melihat kasus trafficking itu banyak terjadi di indonesia salah satu indikasinya dapat kita lihat pemberitaan di media media massa yang setiap hari ada satu kasus
4859492 uu ini telah mengatur sanksi tegas bagi setiap pelaku misalnya dengah hukuman seumur hidup dan denda sampai rp5 miliar orang akan berpikir panjang melakukan tindak pidana trafficking karena hukumannya berat
4859493 hal penting adalah adanya peran serta masyarakat dan meningkatkan kerjasama dengan aparat penegak hukum sebagai upaya mencegah terjadinya trafficking

4859514 christmas is always a stressful time when it comes to relationships because of the myth presented by the media that puts individuals and couples under enormous emotional and financial pressure to live up to the image created

4859527 this ad is just more of the same old false and discredited attacks that senator mccain knows arent true senator mccain will say or do anything to hide the truth while obama will cut taxes for the middle class mccain will give a billion dollars in new tax breaks to americas eight largest corporations while his plan provides no direct relief for more than 100 million american families and despite his rhetoric hes refusing to support the bipartisan senate proposal to expand production and invest in renewable energy because he wants to protect tax breaks for oil companies weve seen what happens when we put the oil companies and their lobbyists ahead of working families and thats exactly what americans want to change in this election

4859543 irv if given the choice between looking like him and looking like me
4859544 now we need to discuss our synagogues decorum i think its disgraceful that people come to shul dressed any which way that they please we need to have standards this is a makom tefillah not a bus station
4859545 i say we set strict standards for dress in bnai joshua for weekday prayer i suggest that men must wear shirts with collars long pants not sweat pants and shoes
4859546 in addition on shabbat i think men should be expected to wear a dress suit or a jacket and pants and a dress shirt sandals and sneakers are not acceptable
4859547 and of course i would recommend it but im not sure that can be enforced
4859548 must they be expected to conform to our dress code even if they didnt know it before they came to visit
4859549 and im sure we can exercise some leniency when it comes to our guests
4859550 our gabbayim will have the discretion to give a kibbud to a guest who doesnt adhere to the letter of the policy but is still dressed in a dignified manner
4859551 the whole thing is crazy wont we be excluding anyone from outside our community that somehow wanders into our shul to daven with us and wont we be alienating guests who follow a more casual guideline or are from a less formal community how about baalei teshuva who are new to all this havent any of you been to an ncsy shabbaton or a kiruv event where those who are uninitiated in our customs walked in with sneakers and jeans not knowing any differently
4859552 lets table that for another meeting perhaps one where all our female board members attend
4859553 weve lived for forty years as a community without a strict dress code
4859554 rabbi the board would be very interested in hearing your thoughts on this matter what do you think
4859555 you know ronny i remember when your father alav hashalom was president of bnai joshua he was a great leader
4859556 he was also a very formal man you would never see him without a jacket and tie and i can never recall seeing him with a hair out of place
4859557 i can recall one time when he rushed straight from a pool party when he was called to help make a minyan because we were one man short i think he actually arrived in bermuda shorts and flip flops because it was all he had with him but he was the tenth man and without him sid lefkowitz wouldnt have been able to say kaddish
4859558 still while you were all speaking i was thinking about a pasuk in parshat shemot
4859559 hashem had moshe take off his shoes because of an issue of
4859560 now i know that you all want to institute this dress code because youre concerned about maintaining
4859561 lets work on being mekarev those outside our community lets work on social action and collecting more tzedakah lets get more people to attend our daily minyanim and lets lead by example and dress appropriately ourselves but i think we can go without an official dress code for now
4859562 las religiones y la f sica tienen sus reglas unas se pueden romper las otras no
4859563 thamnopis sirtalis the common garter snake can grow from eighteen to forty eight inches long
4859564 now im just going to sling this around your fathers neck yerucham and hell have himself one fine snake skin necklace
4859565 but you know there are many famous people who overcame their dislike of snakes and rose to greatness
4859566 well for example moshe rabbeinu our leader moses the greatest prophet of all time was not much of a snake person in parshat shemot when g d has him throw down his staff and it becomes a snake do you know what he did
4859567 the torah says vayanas moshe mipanav moshe fled from the snake he was freaked out much like you were but moshe got over his fear and he eventually threw his staff down in front of pharoah and it became a snake and not just any snake but a seriously wicked looking snake that ate the snakes of all the egyptian sorcerers
4859568 moshe overcame his fear because he knew the jewish people were counting on him
4859569 he became courageous because he had to im sure it wasnt easy for him
4859570 but he also helped start the plagues of frogs lice and wild beasts now that couldnt have been much fun for a guy who was scared of a little snake wouldnt you agree josh
4859571 so whadya say will you wear the snake for yerucham and his friends
4859572 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces which is a serious violation of international humanitarian law
4859573 the ltte leadership has issued orders to artificially create a human catastrophe in areas where security forces are now fighting the terrorists
4859574 manny my love father of my children i suspect your weight problem has nothing to do with what you ate today or even what you ate on yom tov
4859575 to be honest with you i think its a teshuva issue
4859576 you know how aveirot sins can weigh heavily on your soul and how on the days between rosh hashana and yom kippur you are judged by hashem as if your good deeds and bad deeds from the year are balanced on a scale
4859577 well maybe this is hashem s way of telling you that your sins are weighing you down maybe you need to do better teshuva repentance before the book of life is closed on yom kippur
4859578 dont worry sweetie go to the mikveh and when you come back i can almost guarantee youll be back to your usual weight
4859579 you have a pure and beautiful neshama manny trust me
4859580 now i really need to make my teshuva complete on yom kippur
4859581 manny removed his handset his modulator later his exclusion privacy adapter and his tkm 6 transfer switches
4859582 i just came over to apologize for my outburst earlier
4859583 o k o k i heard you i was just rying to let you off the hook
4859584 well anyway im very sorry i just wasnt paying attention and i forgot that the shofar blowing was coming and that gersh rosenthal he gave such a blast
4859585 still you have nothing to be ashamed of neil as a matter of fact i found your outburst rather inspiring
4859586 rabbi i know you always try to find the good in everything but this time i have to admit im having trouble finding the positive in my synagogue scream
4859587 i would have to say that ive never seen anyone demonstrate the shofar blowing as a wake up call better than you did this morning neil in fact if youre not feeling the urgency of elul now you probably never will
4859588 rabbi goldstein i think i can tell you with complete candor that i am definitely feeling it
4859589 thats good maybe when you come to minyan tomorrow youll be better prepared
4859590 its no secret to anyone in the room that i dont know much about football when i was a kid back in brooklyn i used to play a mean game of stickball but that was more than a few years ago
4859591 does anyone know how many people watch the super bowl every year
4859592 i read this morning that eight hundred million people worldwide are expected to watch the super bowl now thats a lot of people not only that
4859593 anyway as i was saying can you imagine eight hundred million people watching one event
4859594 but do you know what the difference is between the super bowl and moshes final address to the jewish people
4859595 rashi explains that this comment is intended to include future generations even future jews are witnesses to what moshe was telling the israelites on that day
4859596 i guess that would be like watching a replay of the super bowl years later on espn like last week my dad and i watched super bowl iii where the jets dismantled the colts and even though i wasnt born yet i felt like i was at the game
4859597 gee ben zion i guess youre right the pasuk in nitzavim is sort of like a game replayed on espn that was very inciteful
4859598 do you have any idea why im giving you a ticket mr bauman
4859599 count to ten effie and if that doesnt work count to ten again
4859600 now ephraim you can catch a lot more flies with honey than with vinegar
4859601 this has got to be some kind of joke am i on candid camera or spy tv or something
4859602 ive crossed this street my whole life anywhere that i wanted and i didnt receive so much as a warning let alone a ticket
4859603 im sorry sir but about two months ago a man was struck by a car and was seriously injured when he crossed main street outside the crosswalk since then weve had a zero tolerance policy for jay walking
4859604 yes officer doloshevsky i get that but dont you think this is taking this thing a bit too far i mean arent there serious crimes you should be out there preventing do you really consider this a useful public service persecuting pedestrians
4859605 mr bauman im charged to maintain public order and safeguard the citizens of this town if giving out tickets for relatively minor infractions will prevent another unfortunate accident then its all worth it
4859606 says the mayor and the town council that made the laws i just enforce them
4859607 and on another level g d says so in the torah
4859608 the first pasuk of shoftim states shoftim veshot rim titen lecha bechol shearecha asher hashem elokecha noten lecha lishvatecha veshaftu et haam mishpat tzedek judges and officers shall you appoint in all your cities which hashem your g d gives you for your tribes and they shall judge the people with righteous judgements g d commanded that the judges set up a legal system and that the police officers enforce the law its all written in the torah in black and white
4859609 isnt that only the divine law that theyre supposed to enforce
4859610 i just dont think the torah had jay walking in mind
4859611 im relatively certain that setting up a court system and enforcing the law is one of the shiva mitzvot bnai noach the seven laws that everyone in the world is expected to observe so i would say the pasuk would probably include jay walking on some level
4859612 while youre at it are you planning to enforce any other laws from this weeks parsha say a ban on sorcery or false prophecy
4859613 when will we be hearing some besorot tovot some good news from you and fayge ive already picked out the plate i plan to break at the tenaim
4859614 i think shes just too pretty for someone like me im not sure its going to work out
4859615 its so simple that ill tell you what to do and spare the chochom the trouble is that o k with you hershel
4859616 well its like the parsha of eyshet yefat toar in parshat ki teyze surely you know the story
4859617 when the jews were in the desert moshe rabeinu tells them that if they go out to war against another nation and a nice jewish boy sees among his captives a beautiful not so jewish girl he must shave her head let her nails grow and change her out of her attractive clothes and let her sit for a month before he can marry her
4859618 so thats what you need to do you need to see fayge as a real person not as some pretty bauble
4859619 because in twenty years that will be what fayge looks like
4859620 the mother is as radiant as the morning sun a true beauty i see no end to my suffering
4859621 i guess well have to go to plan b its not going to be pretty but it usually does the trick
4859622 i know im going to be sorry i asked but whats plan b
4859623 you need to take a friend that you trust and go to fayges house early in the morning earlier than she usually gets up then you must wake her and see what she looks like before she has had any time to prepare i believe this knowledge will set you free and allow you to see this woman as she truly is dont you think so hershel
4859624 i was just in your neighborhood with my friend menachem and i was thinking maybe you would want to catch a bite tonight at the new deli in west orange
4859625 she still looked beautiful not a hair out of place
4859626 chezki my friend the chochom of hasbrouk heights is a genius i may not be a wise man but i feel safe in suggesting that you should definitely marry this woman
4859627 and i only met her for a moment but i feel safe in stating that for you fayges inner beauty is what is causing you to have trouble getting past her outer beauty and if thats the case that will never fade
4859628 statiunea alfa noi suntem prima statiune pentru pensionarii din romania
4859629 sunt succese care te injosesc si infrangeri care te inalta
4859630 the chinese team has no chance to even play against us if the olympics werent held in china
4859631 in asia the japanese koreans and taiwanese are good at it because they have been occupied in one form or another by the americans
4859632 there are all these undercover cops videotaping us during the games
4859633 they are afraid we might unfurl the taiwanese flag or do something political why would we we know we will be arrested
4859634 it was an amazing game we totally did not see this coming we are not in the same league
4859635 they were so well organized they had their own songs and chants at first we didnt know what we were doing then we tried to copy them and started cheering together for the chinese side and the chinese team started to catch up i guess it really helped
4859636 we have never lost to china before i am sorry i had to witness this first defeat especially when it happened here in beijing
4859637 there is still a bit of work to do but certainly the intent is there
4859638 broadly speaking we think it is a great place to take the game we are working towards that at the moment there are still a few issues we are trying to work through but we hope that we can overcome them
4859639 we had a delegation visit with afl south africa to have a look at the stadium and its surface and amenities
4859640 weve had discussions with the nab and the two clubs involved because they are partners in the development of the game in south africa
4859641 cape town is the western cape province and thats the one that collingwood sponsors west coast sponsors the development of the game in kwazulu natal
4859642 there are certainly some great opportunities for us in south africa
4859643 our clear priority is strengthening what we are doing in queensland and new south wales but we increasingly have an eye for what is happening internationally
4859644 we have been astounded by the uptake of the game in south africa and pleased with the support of the south african government
4859645 dubai proved that we can go into an area identify partners and run a world class event
4859646 everyone in and around melbourne footy club knows that a marquee ruckman is the no 1 recruiting priority
4859647 now that robert warnocks season is finished well look to spell out opportunities that we can present well put a bit of work into it
4859648 i suppose thats par for the course it is unusual in season but he is certainly a very required player for us and a big part of our future get the best of foxtel
4859649 its up to him if he says hes right hes right he is not perfect we know that
4859650 the shape of your chest would be permanently altered if you didnt have the pec attached properly from the sternum bone in the middle of your chest
4859651 if its off the bone it can be fixed at any time and he shouldnt have any permanent risk because the damage is done youll be sore and you wont be able to play to the best of your ability with that type of injury
4859652 the bigger concern would be if the player had a three quarter tear in the muscle and you are playing sore there would be an enormous amount of scar tissue as it tries to heal
4859653 it may not heal properly so you might end up with permanent weakness in your arm in a non sporting sense it may not affect you later in life but in a sporting sense it would
4859654 an estranged son of a baseball legend jeff bridges who together embark on a road trip across america
4859655 it really has both elements of comedy and drama its kind of a slice of life type film
4859656 we invite their parents to come and visit with them they actually have movie nights we have looked through every one of these files these juveniles are dangerous
4859657 what do you expect were an occupied country with a puppet government
4859658 but more often concern about his emerging overconfidence which is making it difficult to interact with him
4859659 if he watches curious george for 20 more seconds i can go to the bathroom
4859660 if his nap lasts another 10 minutes maybe i can get in a shower today
4859661 id never let my kids watch tv before they turn three
4859662 a company a brand of beer a politicians or an officer in the army
4859663 watching that relay my hearts pounding my stomach is starting to do flip flops but im trying to be very composed on the outside i hope it comes across that way
4859664 your son will never be able to focus on anything
4859665 this is the part where we need to make an effort
4859666 the blame is being put on me for you and lauren drifting apart and i dont think thats fair
4859667 once cy500 pound exchanged hands some kind of ceremony took place using the specific objects mentioned
4859668 according to the plaintiff at the end of it hairs wrapped around a nail were found inside an egg to prove a spell had been casted against him it was then the plaintiff was ridely awakened and realised he was being made a fool of and filed a complaint to the police
4859669 being in law school is a professionw here many are called but few are chosen to get in and just to be there is an honour and to give it your best shot is all you can be expected to do
4859670 guess what perhaps god who made everything can pretty much do anything including create a giant pink flying elephant if he wanted to and then instantly make it disappear
4859671 one in five republican senators have said they wont attend the gop convention
4859672 we would have liked to move ahead with the project
4859673 but we saw that the preparations are not yet sufficient and we instructed our energy ministries to carry out a more detailed work
4859674 undoubtedly turkey has allies undoubtedly turkey differs with iran on many issues but we would regret it if some would think that we do things because someone tells us to do so
4859675 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4859676 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4859677 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4859678 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4859679 she tried to put the water hose on it to do what we could do but by that time it was too late
4859680 it was too much fire the water hose wouldnt do nothing
4859681 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
4859682 in the same area on the first floor at the rear
4859683 but the bodies did appear to have some severe burns
4859684 arrests have been made under the charges of waging war against the state and also for murder both unbailable offenses
4859685 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4859686 moving around to weaken the civilian administration and perhaps create the conditions for political upheaval down the line
4859687 there can be no negotiated capitulations and negotiated dismemberment of smaller countries by bigger ones
4859688 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4859689 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4859690 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4859691 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4859692 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4859693 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4859694 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4859695 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4859696 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4859697 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4859698 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4859699 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4859700 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4859701 we have lived through the most terrible 10 days of our recent history
4859702 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4859703 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4859704 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4859705 i heard a lot of avalanches around us i thought im too young to die
4859706 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4859707 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing

4859725 why do people care about michelangelo he wasnt that good
4859726 achievement those occur only in a talented few that pop up randomly like in a civilization revolution game it does not come from the ordinary
4859727 this is the only definitive book on milk ever written
4859728 it should change the attitude of the american people concerning the value of unprocessed foods every american concerned about his
4859729 filled with truth and hilarity all the stuff that usually only fiction is made of
4859730 weve got complete control of this process and thats unique
4859731 were able to make heart muscle cells in unprecedented quantities and on top of it theyre all the same this is good news in terms of treatment as well as for scientific research and testing of potentially new drugs
4859732 science is the only reliably way to understand the natural world
4859733 to answer questions such as why did the universe come into being
4859734 if god exists then he must be outside the natural world and therefore the tools of science are not the right ones to learn about him
4859735 only a supernatural force that is outside of space and time could have done that
4859736 the odds against a universe like ours emerging out of something like the big bang are enormous i think there are religious implications
4859737 it would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun just this way except as the act of a god who indented to create beings like us
4859738 in matters that are so obscure and far beyond our vision we find in holy scripture passages which can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith we have received in such cases we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that if further progress in the search for truth undermines this position we too fall with it

4859837 one of the worlds greatest problems is the impossibilty of any person searching for the truth on any subject when they believe they already have it
4859838 ventura county public schools are in crisis our kids are not getting the public education they need and deserve and ventura county taxpayers are not getting the sound financial management of their schools they should expect
4859839 this is a serious challenge my real world business management skills my proven record of public education accomplishments and my state and national child advocacy relationships will help resolve our current crisis
4859840 after being approached by a wide spectrum of community leaders who have become frustrated with the incumbent board members focus on politics rather than children i felt a genuine obligation to run for school board i am running for just one reason because our school board and our students desperately need new leadership
4859841 my candidacy has already been enthusiastically endorsed by state superintendent of schools jack oconnell and ventura county supervisor kathy long
4859842 mark will guide the board to make our childrens scholastic success their highest priority he has my full support

4859845 the world is so complicated today with images and information bombarding us all the time
4859846 controlling your environment allows you to feel that youre at least controlling something
4859847 you cant control iraq you cant control the economy but you can control the amount of dust in your carpet its a way to feel as if youre not powerless
4859848 a chaotic period can be a catalyst for greater understanding
4859849 when theres stress in a marriage and you work through it together it leads to greater intimacy and depth
4859850 you can run from emotions and ideas that make you uncomfortable you can repress them as fiercely as possible or you can step back and figure out what youre struggling with
4859851 the more you face your frailties and understand yourself the more empathy youll be able to muster
4859852 if you focus all your energy on excessively organizing your time or your desk you wont be as open to all kinds of opportunities
4859853 the more stuff you have out in the open the more ways there are to arrange the items and the more information you can gain from them
4859854 i need to see my materials tools and photos around me they make me want to create if i dont see them im not as inspired to move forward with my work
4859855 in companies theres a tendency to put everyone with the same function on the same floor
4859856 but if you sit different departments together so folks mingle at the coffeemaker theres more chance for an influx of new ideas
4859857 ive actually thrown out a sink full of dishes that had been sitting for so long that they were caked in muck rather than attempt to wash them it was simply easier for me to buy new ones
4859858 you cant let mess impede your enjoyment of the meal
4859859 i vowed to be tidy in all areas not only in the kitchen i set up an ultra organized filing system and spent days stashing every piece of paper i owned into its exact place
4859860 but it was so disheartening when the mail came with new bills and things to file i realized i was never going to keep up
4859861 by letting paper pile up for a while before you deal with it you make one trip to the filing cabinet instead of 10
4859862 if a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind of what then is an empty desk
4859863 i sort of accept my messiness but i still strive for some kind of system and thats when i make my discoveries when im weeding through the monstrosity of paper that is our dining room i inevitably find a years worth of my sons drawings in a bin and its fantastic to see his progress same with all the other stuff around i love the serendipity of it especially when ive lost something for so long that ive forgotten about it when i do tidy up however half assed it turns life into a treasure hunt
4859864 if youre not always focused on finding the main path youre more open to the world
4859865 if you feel hollow inside a fabulous apartment wont make everything better
4859866 youll always be searching for the next level of perfection
4859867 you can treat your home like a museum but still get termites
4859868 its possible to be happy even if your desires are never fully satisfied
4859869 your yearnings themselves can be a huge source of self awareness and joy
4859870 but when we try to justify the unjustifiable what were doing is blaming or deflecting were saying that cant happen to me
4859871 mess is life and too often we dont appreciate it until its gone
4859872 a few days ago i went to get my idiotic overpriced vacuum cleaner fixed and discovered that surprise dog hair had gummed up the works the guys at the repair store were joking that i needed to get a different less sheddy dog then i told them what had happened and they hugged me now every time i look around my apartment and notice that the tumbleweeds of rusty hair are gone i feel sad in retrospect there was joy in that mess
4859873 they seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power military diplomatic information in a very disciplined way
4859874 it appears this was well thought out and planned in advance and suggests a level of coordination in the russian government between the military and the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today

4859893 i picked this piece for sandra gray because of our mutual interests in plants and gardens sandra has been involved in plants both wild and domesticated since childhood due in part to the influence of her father who was a lifelong botanist we both share a love for wild flowers and the wild places that nurture them her garden and her art include many of our beautiful native north carolina flowers she and i have enjoyed talking and trading emails about her flowering gardens and my hiking through glades of blooming wild flowers this spring in the smoky mountains i enjoy all kinds of outdoor activities but especially cycling hiking and camping all of my current art works are plein air landscapes done either around charlotte or in the appalachian mountains of the carolinas georgia tennessee ad virginia my work has taken me all over the world including living for extended periods of time in the u k italy and russia so those landscapes also appear in my art i am interested in meeting other members of the charlotte art league that would be interested in plein air painting

4859930 look i thought i would do all the basic and right things i did many years ago
4859931 and i would get the same kind of response i also wasnt ready for some seemingly innocent questions from recruiters as to why i was downsized
4859932 i polished my resume contacted some of my colleagues and began some generalized networking this produced several initial discussions with human resource managers and third party recruiters so i kind of thought i had momentum some of these people gave me pointed resume advice such as change headers do an ascii version add more accomplishments post it on some of the main sites like monster com and careerbuilder com look at medzilla and more i did all these things but i did not get interviews that i wanted
4859933 i did my generalized networking and started looking at competitors i even talked to them they were worried about some old non compete i had signed out of my niche area of medical product sales the third party recruiters said i didnt have the recent experience i needed to work in the field that got me angry once or twice one even said i sounded a little bitter on the phone about leaving which made me wonder about my interview skills then i started shotgunning my resume to anything i saw that looked even close i even customized it for each position or so i thought that didnt work either
