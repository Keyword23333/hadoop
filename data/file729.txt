7290002 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7290003 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

7290145 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7290146 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7290147 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7290148 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7290149 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7290150 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7290151 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7290152 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7290153 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7290154 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7290155 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7290156 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7290157 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7290158 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7290159 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7290160 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7290161 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7290162 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7290163 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

7290168 why doesnt the person who organises leeds festival come down here now and well have a word
7290169 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7290170 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7290171 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7290172 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7290173 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7290174 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7290175 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7290176 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7290177 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7290178 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7290179 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7290180 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7290181 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7290182 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7290183 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7290184 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7290185 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7290186 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7290187 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7290188 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7290189 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7290190 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7290191 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7290192 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7290193 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7290194 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7290195 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7290196 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7290197 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7290198 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7290199 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7290200 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7290201 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7290202 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7290203 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7290204 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7290205 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7290206 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7290207 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7290208 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7290209 as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs

7290211 prison worked for blake its the only thing that can now save amy
7290212 golden city manager mike bestor has withdrawn his barbecue invitation to a news channel based in the middle east after a community uproar that spilled over into the city council thursday night bestor said he issued the invitation to al jazeera englis which is based in the middle east as a private citizen the network planned to do interviews at the gathering as part of its democratic national convention next week the city issued a statement thursday night in which bestor said he realized his job indirectly linked the event to the city
7290213 all of us at al jazeera english hope that you take the time to learn a bit more about what we do and what we represent we want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to visit your city and we assure you that our reporting will be nothing less than balanced informative and professional
7290214 pre chosen golden residents were scheduled to dine on al jazeera provided hot dogs and hamburgers and be interviewed about their reactions to obamas speech as well as views on health care and the environment
7290215 during two hours of public comment at the council meeting residents spoke for and against al jazeera broadcasting from golden jim dale who is a veteran said at the meeting that he has fought for first amendment rights and welcomes the network others questioned whether the network will skew coverage a particular way and whether the networks presence is disrespectful to veterans and those serving in the military its not ok for the city to roll out the red carpet for a network that is so closely tied to terrorists said steve hosie
7290216 to perform an attack you must fart into the controller the bigger the fart the more powerful the attack
7290217 theyre all out looking for renewable clean power and a way to lasso it
7290218 its exciting that people are interested because the more people who are interested the lower the prices are going to be because the greater the competition will be
7290219 we may have a starting gate that has 200 horses in it
7290220 i expect theres going to be a lot of bidders in this clean power call but still the b c utilities commission has to decide the demand and confirm b c hydros need and it also has to confirm all contracts b c hydro has to enter into
7290221 youve got the potential for wind projects in this province
7290222 youve got the potential for run of river hydro projects in this province maybe someones come in on the tidal side or there is the ocean side i dont know because right now its so early its hard to tell how big the starting gate is for the horse race
7290223 all new electricity generating projects are going have to have zero net greenhouse gas emissions
7290224 the reason for these calls is were committed to be electricity self sufficient by 2016
7290225 the dilemma with this field is there is a lot of hyperbole and a lot of dramatic positioning driven sometimes by very real ecological concerns sometimes by other factors
7290226 every builder has to pound the ground and cut the forest down to put a house in its place
7290227 i will only be happy if they get substantial convictions
7290228 it will always be somewhere in the back of his mind and im sure it takes part in some of his dreams
7290229 it was a terrible thing to happen that should never have happened
7290230 if we call our case we lose that last kick at the cat opportunity as well
7290231 by not calling evidence the crown has to draw all the strings together and try and come up with a common thread and then we have an opportunity to hear the entirety of that argument before we make ours
7290232 in general theres a circumstantial body of evidence that the crown is going to rely on and suggest that it is sufficient to prove his involvement
7290233 obviously the man was kidnapped its a question of who did it or if you will what involvement they had
7290234 i might have something to say after the verdict but not now
7290235 our job is going to be to say when you look at the evidence carefully that actually isnt what occurred
7290236 basically the law on circumstantial evidence is such that if theres other reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence the judge is obliged to consider those
7290237 its all stuff that can be dealt with by way of argument because if there are other inferences that can be drawn he silverman is obliged to consider them
7290238 hes so experienced as a former criminal defence lawyer himself that he is capable of doing that
7290239 if it was a jury trial it would have been substantially different
7290240 for these guys that means getting up at five oclock in the morning getting shipped in

7290247 i dont think it was as good as last week against portsmouth
7290248 for us today it was just about stopping them and getting three points
7290249 they have a good squad and good organisation they are athletic and they have power
7290250 some people said that chelsea will win the league easily after last week because they want us to believe this so that we will relax and lose some points
7290251 hes an intelligent player a very good dribbler with good control of the ball hes smart

7290271 its many fewer hours than working at wal mart and if its not completely disgusting the women may see it as just something that doesnt particularly identify them in any way in other words their identity as a person may not be i am a prostitute or a sex worker

7290273 its hard to find a nice guy thats successful and so isnt gonna split the bill at mcdonalds

7290275 but this is right on the line if the relationship exists for some time and the guy is mega rich he can give you whatever he wants its not prostitution anymore lets face it a lot of relationships are like that its a common thing
7290276 i really dont know if i could stand banging some disgusting creep for money but there are really some pretty compelling reasons to try

7290291 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7290292 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7290293 its a commonsense response to the realities on the ground
7290294 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
7290295 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry

7290297 political appointees at the department of labor are moving with unusual speed to push through in the final months of the bush administration a rule making it tougher to regulate workers on the job exposure to chemicals and toxins
7290298 the agency did not disclose the proposal as required in public notices

7290306 financial firms speculating for their clients or for themselves account for about 81 percent of the oil contracts on the nymex a far bigger share than had previously been reported by the agency
7290307 financial speculation did play a significant part in the rapid increase in oil prices
7290308 these two actions in combination would provide a powerful signal to speculators and world oil markets that will help alleviate the current upward pressure on prices and help american families
7290309 if h r 6346 or any similar price control bill were presented to the president his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill
7290310 the administration is strongly opposed to h r 6604 which offers poorly targeted short term measures that do nothing to address the fundamentals of supply and demand that bear the primary responsibility for current high energy prices

7290315 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis
7290316 since water consumption goes up where there is development and improved lifestyles we can expect even greater demands on fresh water
7290317 there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate that water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries
7290318 by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis
7290319 the crisis stems from a confluence of problems but perhaps no contributing factor is more insidious and correctable than the privatisation of the resource
7290320 when peoples access to clean drinking water is reliant on the profit interests of a handful of transnationals all of us pay a premium and because of this many of the worlds poor go thirsty

7290364 in moscow we witnessed the beginning of the end of that era which began in 1945
7290365 with this step we have enhanced the security of both nations we have begun to reduce the level of fear by reducing the causes of fear our two peoples and for all the peoples of the world
7290366 i was able to get a sense of his soul a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country
7290367 the russian side in such a situation will take adequate measures to compensate for potential threats to its national security
7290368 placing elements of a global anti missile system by the u s in eastern europe only deepens the situation and we will be forced to react to this adequately
7290369 i regret that the glasgow bar association have paid lobbyists in order to trawl around for mistakes it doesnt serve them well
7290370 we want to reward lawyers for doing their job not have people playing the system unfortunately it does seem that a small minority of lawyers want to persist in milking the system
7290371 as you will probably know they gba have employed media consultants who have basically commenced a campaign through the scottish sun regarding diversion being used in serious cases rather than prosecuting somebody in court the consultants are looking for any cases where it would appear that diversion has been used for something more serious than it should have
7290372 apparently the consultants are offering discretion and confidentiality and if any member has such a case they want to report to them they should send an email to john mmm pr
7290373 we deploy our experiences skills and contacts to ensure that mmm campaigns make headlines and achieve results
7290374 i cant see how this is about protecting the public from harm
7290375 this is a matter that should concern the general public
7290376 it seems to be a bit of a lottery depending on the fiscal you get on the day
7290377 our company was recently appointed as short term media advisers to the glasgow bar association there has been intense press and media interest in issues linked to summary justice reform and the use of fiscal fines the gba asked mmm to provide advice on how best to deal with inquiries from journalists and to help promote their point of view
7290378 the gba have consistently argued that fiscal fines are not in the public interest because some offenders who are guilty of violent and other serious offences are not being convicted through the courts and escape without a criminal record
7290379 the overwhelming motivation was to have some assistance with the press they are helping us with all aspects of getting our message across
7290380 our members are gravely concerned about diversion and the effect it will have on the public
7290381 thats certainly one aspect but its not the only driving force
7290382 i regret that the glasgow bar association have paid lobbyists in order to trawl around for mistakes it doesnt serve them well

7290435 lo o tocar en un bar me vastaron 15 minutos para darme cuenta que el era el guitarrista que buscaba
7290436 no era una guitarra ritmica asi que empeze a practicar punteos y me di cuenta que era lo mio
7290437 cuando teminamos el show hab a un tipo que gritaba reclamandome como un loco decia que lo mirara bi n por que el ser a el guitarrista de mi banda y yo me pregunte quien es ese idiota pero poco tiempo despues lo o tocar en un bar me vastaron 15 minutos para darme cuenta que el era el guitarrista que buscaba

7290439 yo vengo de esa epoca cuando era chico la manera de jugar a ser grande no era con computadoras sino con velas e incienso tomando cerveza liviana y escuchando musica de hendrix era la concepcion mas inocente en un mundo en que los musicos pensaban en la musica y no en los ranking las fm o los discos de platino honestamente creo que un retroceso en ese sentido no vendria nada mal a un par de artistas y el publico podria volver a disfrutar de buena musica en vez de comprar pedazos de plastico

7290441 creo que ya era hora que hiciera una carrera solista en serio cont en esa poca porque en todos estos a os aprend a ensayar laburar y producir aunque formalmente aparezco como solista no estoy solo todos nosotros integramos un grupo que se llama david lebon
7290442 hay algunos temas de la poca en que viv a en una quinta en castelar pero la mudanza a capital influy en otras canciones al venir a vivir a un departamento no puedo tocar ni trabajar tanto como antes all pod a ensayar con el grupo o tocar el piano a cualquier hora y sin molestar a nadie ahora ni siquiera tengo instrumentos en casa y eso influye a la hora de componer

7290449 all this was a big joke it got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be
7290450 rest assure you havent heard the whole story yet and when we can we will update you via this site when possible
7290451 so we decided to go ahead and do it since our negotiations with a couple of the high profile buyers has stalled do to all the crazy press coverage you should have seen their faces when we walked into the freezer and unwrapped rickmat one of the chics in the group screamed and then puked all over herself and a couple of the guys were in a total state of shock they could barely talk when we left the freezer it was awesome i wish we had known about these folks a few weeks ago theyre really nice and very very smart im certain they would have saved us the big mess we now need to clean up
7290452 now fetch me those boys who tried to fool the world and thought it was funny

7290456 its a very very tough time not only for cornish fishermen but for fishermen throughout the united kingdom
7290457 oil prices have gone up and that affects so many things not just the fuel costs but plastic equipment such as pots because they are oil based
7290458 we need to break down the common fisheries policy so that it is run region by region by people who know what is happening to the fishing stocks
7290459 british fishermen are having to tip fish back into the sea just because it doesnt meet the quota and thats lunatic
7290460 with all the oil prices having gone up its had a snowball effect its not just the fuel but the price of the plastic to the manufacturer and the leads to the cost of the gear going up
7290461 paperwork now has just got ridiculous even for a small boat like mine i could spend a whole hour a day on paperwork alone then if you land pounds1 000 of shellfish its a full week before you get paid for it another thing we should be encouraging is youngsters in the fishing industry
7290462 the plan allows naturally ignited fires to burn within designated wildland fire use areas
7290463 under these conditions the fire is allowed to play its natural role on the landscape
7290464 it all happens very fast but that one definitely bothered me a little bit
7290465 i decided to let it expire i mean were human too
7290466 it was obvious that the rhino was injured to some degree as it left its forest to come out on the flat terrain of the oil palm plantation
7290467 when we first got there the rhino showed signs of aggression and made mock charges at us but we kept our distance and left leaves and fruits for it to eat as the oil palm environment is not suitable for wildlife
7290468 for me this is a huge opportunity to potentially bridge the gap between being a professional player and having a proper job as a coach
7290469 coaching was never a lifetime ambition for me but certainly at the end of the season i will be looking more into which direction i go in
7290470 i am learning a lot working alongside the ulster coaches and there is plenty of knowledge to draw on every day
7290471 a lot of people have now started investing in art and subsequently evading tax by under valuing their purchase
7290472 a lot of imported art work was even not listed in the brought in items by some art galleries a few years ago

7290480 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7290481 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7290482 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7290483 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7290484 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7290485 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7290486 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7290487 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7290488 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7290489 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7290490 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

7290494 frankly we feel pretty good about where new releases are this year but we feel even better about what were going to be able to do with catalog
7290495 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7290496 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7290497 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7290498 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7290499 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7290500 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7290501 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7290502 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7290503 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7290504 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7290505 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7290506 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7290507 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7290508 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7290509 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7290510 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7290511 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7290512 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7290513 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7290514 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7290515 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7290516 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7290517 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7290518 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7290519 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7290520 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7290521 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7290522 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7290523 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7290524 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7290525 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7290526 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7290527 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7290528 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7290529 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7290530 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7290531 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7290532 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7290533 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7290534 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7290535 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7290536 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7290537 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7290538 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7290539 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7290540 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7290541 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7290542 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7290543 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7290544 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7290545 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7290546 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7290547 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7290548 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7290549 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7290550 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7290551 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7290552 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7290553 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7290554 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7290555 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7290556 previous studies have already suggested taking aspirin could cut the chance of having a heart attack or stroke by a third and the risk of a fatal attack by 15 per cent

7290560 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7290561 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7290562 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7290563 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7290564 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7290565 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7290566 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7290567 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7290568 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7290569 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7290570 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7290571 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

7290576 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7290577 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7290578 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7290579 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7290580 they stop between floors they skip floors sometimes you can see the shaft all the way to the bottom when the doors open
7290581 this is about peoples lives you have sick people elderly people who are at risk
7290582 sometimes you come into a building and the lobby is full of folks who cant get up because the elevators arent working
7290583 but the worst was when my son was found dead in the hudson river last year and i almost missed the funeral because the elevators were not working
7290584 sometimes the elevator will go up to my floor and then zoom it goes right back down to the bottom without the doors ever opening
7290585 there is no serious backlog in day to day repair
7290586 but in the replacement of aging elevators there is a significant and growing backlog
7290587 we have almost 6 billion in unmet capital needs which means we are replacing only about one third of the things that need replacement
7290588 youre telling me you have a problem with funds its a good possibility you are mismanaged

7290609 the boards decision regarding severance for former chief mokwa was based solely on the need to bring about a quick resolution that moved the department forward under new leadership
7290610 i dont think any amount of retirement benefits under the law can make up for the sacrifices a member and a members family makes over a 37 and a half year career

7290785 to put yourself through what is a pretty rigorous process of running for president youve got to have learned to set up some pretty high expectations for got to be driving you and in my case if you have somebody that is absent maybe you feel like youve got something to prove when youre young and that pattern sets itself up over time
7290786 the stories i heard about my father painted him as larger than life which also meant that i felt i had something to live up to you could argue that if youre too well adjusted you dont end up running for president so if the pattern sets in pretty early on where youre pushing your comfort level it probably has to do with those very early influences and that can come from either the absence or the presence of a father who ends up motivating you in some way
7290787 without a father he was forced to arm himself and to make his own way into the worlds he chose to join and to master
7290788 obama was left with two alternatives either descend into chaos as a lost soul or steel himself against the world in order to rise in it he chose steeliness over surrender
7290789 is thus one of survival and defense for of all the advice he was ever offered the most significant and the one perhaps most relevant to his rise and to his fate was his stepfather lolo soetoros always protect yourself
7290790 the nice thing about it is that at least people tend to underestimate me
7290791 i think my strength actually comes in my case from the absence of a father at some level i had to raise myself my mother obviously was the dominant influence in my life and i had a stepfather and a grandfather who both participated in raising me and were good men who did good things for me but if i think about how i have been able to navigate some pretty tricky situations in my life it has to do with the fact that i had to learn to trust my own judgment i had to learn to fight for what i wanted
7290792 but because many americans think obama is not what he actually is it has become that
7290793 that is a potential problem particularly in a race that shows ever more signs of being extremely close
7290794 at some point these are issues thoughtful people will need to face head on rather than cede the ground to propagandists who traffic in intolerance and who deprived of the ability to make racial slurs with impunity simply shift their focus to religion
7290795 many have discoursed on what an obama victory could mean for america we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives
7290796 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to in this event the worlds judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race
7290797 the attraction of barack obama as a candidate has less to do with the cut of his suits or the fact that hes championed by hip rock singers than with an almost geeky earnestness a decency and sobriety that he projects when speaking to a crowd
7290798 a large part of his mystique lies in his insistence on his message and on the complexity of that message and in his old fashioned almost stern will to cut the flim flam and in a way so retro its almost novel to actually address the issues
7290799 but will obama amid the pulsating theatrics also attempt the less glamorous and more difficult task of explaining specifically where he wants to move the country and how he proposes to move it above and beyond reciting his policy positions
7290800 history as well as recent public opinion polls suggests that he badly needs to do so
7290801 um if you cant afford it why dont you not bid on the auction
7290802 we worked so hard and the virginia maryland and d c potomac primaries were the beginning of his momentum that carried him through
7290803 it was just an amazing day for all of us
7290804 we feel a special sense of pride because we gave him the momentum he needed
7290805 every time i see obama he mentions something about how that was such a big day for him
7290806 he mentions the tremendous group of victories in maryland d c and virginia he will not forget us
7290807 i think the decisiveness of his victory was a big part in creating the conventional wisdom that we wouldnt be able to catch up with him
7290808 the clinton campaign probably thought feb 5 was going to be the knockout blow and then one week later to have such a clear group of states going obamas way really helped
7290809 we had done good door knocking and had strong visibility
7290810 to me it was kind of a fait accompli we had a business execution and i felt like if we executed wed win all 144 precincts
7290811 its been a kind of beyond your wildest dreams experience to be mentioned
7290812 it was very very flattering to be considered to be mentioned by folks for that position was very gratifying
7290813 when i signed on with senator obama it wasnt to get anything
7290814 my complete expectation is im going to be governor until january 2010
7290815 senator obama has made a great pick in joe biden
7290816 senator obama and senator biden will work very very well in virginia
7290817 i can tell you i suspect theres a great sigh of relief
7290818 there are a bunch of folks who have said i would really hate to lose tim as governor
7290819 democratic caucus and a likely candidate for governor next year said he was proud of kaine as well as sen mark r warner d who were also thought to be under consideration for showing the country that democrats are succeeding in virginia
7290820 when we were growing out of our fairfax office i looked at prince william and said to my boss hey check this place out
7290821 my boss said it looked like a farm community still but i said here is a financial opportunity to invest in a community i saw the growth that was and would continue to occur out here
7290822 this is a progressive very forward thinking environment and it has really benefited us
7290823 in fairfax and alexandria sometimes you feel like youre more on the outside looking in but here everyone makes you feel like you are part of the community
7290824 there are 12 000 economic development offices across the u s trying to compete for only a handful of business opportunities
7290825 were competitive though and theres no doubt about that we have the right people the right climate and it gets better every day
7290826 le notizie che ci arrivano ci piacciono e le impostazioni generali ci convincono molto bisogner poi vedere bene i numeri ed i dettagli che ancora non si conoscono

7290831 politics distorts you turns you into a relentless vote seeking attention craving political animal
7290832 the sitting politician always hopelessly self centred but now on edge loses the ability to answer a simple question
7290833 theyre stuck you convince yourself that if you hang on for just one more election you will make it into cabinet be noticed more and have a softer landing when you finally do leave
7290834 a couple officers pursued him but he was gone we activated the emergency plan for escape and notified the local police departments
7290835 my husband told me that he went out to take the garbage out at a quarter to 7
7290836 and police they were all over our back yard this is a shock nothing like this ever happens
7290837 i like to thank to all the people who supported our government the people of these key provinces endorsed my policy with a key majority
7290838 people of this country voted for sovereign state despite the main opposition campaign against the government this was an election to decide countrys destiny we are fully engaged to crush the terrorism and implement humanitarian operations to rescue the innocent tamil people from the ltte therefore this win encourages my government and security forces to continue this battle against the worlds ruthless terrorist organization so i got the mandate again from this election
7290839 the mandate received by upfa at yesterdays pc polls is a one given to the troops and not to continue with the corruption of the government
7290840 im on social security now and i dont like the idea that its going to immigrants when i paid in it all my life and they just swam across
7290841 well see as much as the subprime losses again on the other side at the very least
7290842 the first stage is done were at the second stage the real issue is how much is how much the prime mortgage portfolio is going to be affected that is going to depend on how far house prices will fall
7290843 this is something we dont have a really good handle on i dont think anyone really knows
7290844 the imf figures seem most credible but if you believe others it could be a lot worse
7290845 thus it is still possible to envision a scenario under which the financial system avoids a sharp contraction in the supply of credit although this is significantly less likely now that it was as recently as may
7290846 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they will take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers preserve price stability while supporting growth and continue injecting liquidity as needed by an industry that is still far from having resolved its problems at a time of strong inflationary pressures and tightening credit conditions
7290847 the days when sag harbor was known as a writers colony are over
7290848 it is becoming increasingly tough to score a decent advance even as a household name
7290849 during the cold war a group of russian journalists toured the united states on the final day of their visit they were asked by their hosts for their impressions

7290852 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
7290853 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7290854 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7290855 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7290856 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music
7290857 an outstanding leader and somebody who would better represent the mainstream of the country
7290858 i briefed the minister about the developments there in vienna
7290859 the situation was carefully assessed by the administration and it was felt that it had become absolutely imperative to take action under law against these channels in larger public interest and for maintenance of public order
7290860 notices had been issued to them local channels not to telecast any such news or any other item which could vitiate the law and order situation and inflame passions with a view to fuelling public disorder
7290861 there are inputs that they separatist leaders could be targeted so as a precautionary measure curfew has been imposed and people have been asked to maintain peace and calm

7290875 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7290876 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared
7290877 however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7290878 now its suddenly become the destination where everybody wants to be at the end of the day to see the sunset and to see the views which are spectacular
7290879 theyre eroding very rapidly the magnificent sculpture on the shrine at the center of the temple is in very fragile condition and has not been treated for conservation yet
7290880 people shouldnt really be touching it or going anywhere near it

7290884 some say youre john the baptist come back from the dead
7290885 some think that youre elijah come back to usher in the great and terrible day of the lord
7290886 and then there are others who say you must be jeremiah or one of the other prophets
7290887 but what about you guys who do you say i am
7290888 youre not just a prophet preparing the way for the messiah youre way more than that you are the messiah youre the son of the living god
7290889 wow simon son of john you didnt get this answer from any human being it came straight from my father in heaven and because youve been bold enough to share what god has revealed to you your confession of faith is going to be the foundation for my church and even the forces of hell and death wont be able to overcome it

7290893 if you dont have a transmission system to get it there it becomes useless
7290894 long distance transmission is only economic if it is built to high capacity which means that there must be a large amount of generation capacity in one place
7290895 education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity
7290896 if you dont have a transmission system to get it there it becomes useless
7290897 long distance transmission is only economic if it is built to high capacity which means that there must be a large amount of generation capacity in one place
7290898 the council noted the denials of the members of parliament repudiating and disassociating themselves from statements attributed to them in the media

7290900 will agree on the allocation of ministries between them for the purpose of day to day supervision
7290901 the prime minister shall serve as a member of the national security council and this will ensure his participation in deliberations on matters of national security and operations pertaining thereto
7290902 tsvangirai wanted an additional paragraph that would have effectively made the president mugabe ceremonial
7290903 the other negotiators however turned down his request arguing that this was a 50 50 power sharing deal
7290904 he noticed that mugabe remained the head of the chain of command in cabinet so why should he agree to be prime minister under these circumstances a prime minister should simply be in charge

7291141 at first i thought about calling you sumah after grandma
7291142 and then i remembered a promise that i had made when i was a young man one day i was out on a camel rounding up cattle the camel stumbled in a dry riverbed and i had fallen some villagers found me lying unconscious and they were convinced that i was near death
7291143 well nothing they could do would wake me all the herbs and medicines failed to stir me they cut me open here
7291144 they wanted to bleed me and let the infection run out but it didnt work even the hijabs that the fakirs prepared didnt help
7291145 finally they took me to halima the medicine woman she treated me for months on end and nursed me until i was well she saved my life of that im certain anyway i promised her that i would name one of my children after her and thats why i named you halima
7291146 come here come here little girl who has my name
7291147 on the day of your naming old halima was brought into the hut
7291148 she was the guest of honor so grandma allowed her to see your face she bent close to kiss you and spotted your white eyelash she may have been old but her beady little eyes missed nothing she called me into the hut and pointed it out she told me that it was a special blessing and that you would bring luck to all the family and so it proved
7291149 you dont have glasses why not can you still see well

7291235 the authors interest one feels is not so much the way in which the mystery is solved but the nature of fate and self fulfilling prophecy once the case begins to bite the glass devil becomes a focused bleak tale about evil stripped down to its basics portrayed with this authors unflinching yet unsensational style
7291236 the interplay between the detectives is drolly portrayed with sigurdur oli as smug and rigid as ever until his own personal happiness is threatened and elinborg is obsessed with her cookery book which is being published and publicised in parallel with the investigation erlunder himself becomes momentarily sociable attending a party in honour of the author almost relating to his son sindri who seems by far the best adjusted of erlunders family and tentatively proceeding with his relationship with valgerdur whom we met in indridasons previous book voices but the special beauty of the book and the reason for its haunting quality is the story of tamas ilona and the group of students who study together in leipzig in the 1950s

7291250 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7291251 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7291252 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7291253 theres a huge complementarity between the feds lender of last resort function and the intimate knowledge of financial institutions
7291254 the macroprudential supervisor would recognize that for the system as a whole excessively conservative lending policies could prove counterproductive if they contribute to a weaker economic and credit environment
7291255 in principle such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered and because activities or risk taking not permitted to regulated institutions have a way of migrating to other financial firms or markets

7291277 the summer phony war for the us presidency is about to end what do markets tell us about the race for the white house
7291278 if the prediction markets run by the university of iowa and intrade are right barack obama is the frontrunner but no
7291279 national polls suggest the markets are too optimistic about mr obama they show the race narrowing in recent weeks with john mccain improving a poll of national polls by pollster com puts mr obamas lead at 45 2 to 43 the trend favours mr mccain
7291280 but state by state surveys favour mr obama by pollster coms reckoning 260 votes in the electoral college are strongly behind him or leaning his way he needs 270 to win
7291281 the elections seem to be all about the economy mr mccains intrade chances of winning bottomed on the same day that the s amp p 500 bottomed last month mr obamas chances hit their peak a day after the oil price reached a top
7291282 mr mccains rise in national polls may be chiefly a reaction to easing pressure on pump prices an economic variable that is very visible to voters

7291286 what i see is a coming world deflation and i believe thats the message the markets are sending

7291288 the ifo world economic climate has worsened in the third quarter of 2008 for the fourth time in succession the decline is primarily the result of more unfavourable assessments of the current economic situation but also the expectations for the coming six months have been revised downwards

7291309 the deepening toll from the global financial crisis could trigger the failure of a large us bank within months a respected former chief economist of the international monetary fund claimed today fuelling another battering for banking shares
7291310 professor kenneth rogoff a leading academic economist said there was yet worse news to come from the worldwide credit crunch and financial turmoil particularly in the united states and that a high profile casualty among american banks was highly likely
7291311 in an ominous warning he added were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks he said
7291312 rising anxieties over worse to come in the credit crisis sent shares tumbling in europe and asia
7291313 professor rogoff who was chief economist at the imf from 2001 to 2004 predicted that the crisis would foster a new wave of consolidation in the us financial sector before it was over with mergers between large institutions

7291319 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months
7291320 data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money aggregates fell by almost 50 billion in july the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959
7291321 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed said gabriel stein the groups leading monetary economist
7291322 on a three month basis the m3 growth rate has fallen from almost 19 earlier this year to just 2
7291323 its obviously worrying people either cant borrow or dont want to borrow even if they can said mr stein

7291326 downside risks to economic growth and contracting corporate credit demand will overwhelm the upward pressure on yields from inflation and treasury supply fears
7291327 our model of the 5 year treasury note suggests that the additional treasury supply due to the increase in the budget deficit anticipated over the next year will have only a negligible effect on yields

7291330 emerging market stocks have tumbled more than is justified because demand for raw materials continues to boost economic growth in those nations mark mobius said
7291331 the correction seems to be overdone but not necessarily over because sentiment globally is very bad mobius who oversees about 40 billion in emerging market equities as executive chairman of templeton asset management in singapore said in a bloomberg radio interview
7291332 the msci emerging markets index has plunged 28 since reaching a record in october as falling oil and metal prices prompted investors to pull money from commodity producing nations
7291333 its more a correction than a significant downturn in the commodities markets the 71 year old investor said
7291334 developing nations will continue to grow at a very rapid pace even as investors anticipate slowdowns in the us and europe mobius said
7291335 mobius said hes buying as many consumer shares in emerging markets as he can the investor cited booming consumer spending in russia and prospects that international corporations will increase spending in developing nations spurring economic growth
7291336 brazil is among the nations where mobius has invested the most although he remains optimistic about the nations prospects he said speculation that the government may keep some oil profits instead of channeling them through petrobras is worrisome

7291339 global capital flows are looking increasingly supportive of the dollar believes stephen hull currency strategist at lehman brothers
7291340 he notes that there has been a significant improvement in the us trade deficit recently with the gap between import and export volume growth now at its highest level since 1994
7291341 related to this are several major issues that are key to foreign exchange markets
7291342 mr hull believes the us current account deficit will shrink sharply as this happens surpluses overseas will shrink resulting in weaker demand for foreign currencies and typically higher demand for the dollar
7291343 as the dollar starts to rise there will be less need for foreign central banks to build up reserves to prevent their own currencies from strengthening he says
7291344 many exchange rates in countries with current account surpluses have been managed to prevent domestic currency appreciation if the dollar rallies on its own reserve accumulation will slow
7291345 central banks have also been diversifying their foreign exchange reserves in recent years with international monetary fund data indicating increased amounts of fx reserves in euros
7291346 gold surged on tuesday after an early decline on the release of the ppi for the past few weeks conventional wisdom aka sophistry held that higher inflation data meant the fed might hike rates which would boost the dollar which is bad for gold
7291347 as we have asserted over the past week once the levered dollar plays dollar vs forex dollar vs gold dollar vs commodity were liquidated fundamentals would re emerge this occurred yesterday with gold
7291348 wsj as gold prices tumbled from their highest level ever investors and collectors loaded up on one ounce
7291349 after reviewing all of the technical economic and fundamental factors over the weekend following are our latest thoughts on whats currently happening
7291350 on friday gold broke clearly below its 65 week moving average which is at 819 as you know this average has been very reliable identifying the major gold trends since the late 60s if gold now stays below 819 it will signal that the major trend has turned down and gold is going lower
7291351 stay put for the time being and keep your metals related positions its still too soon to know if this is just a temporary extreme break which seems the most likely or if this marks the start of a new bear market decline we need to see more
7291352 since gold is so oversold the extent of its rebound rise is now going to be very important
7291353 on the other hand if gold stays below 819 during the rebound rise itll mean that an important trend change is taking place and well either sell or lighten up on our holdings at a better price during the rebound well then plan to buy gold again once it turns technically bullish
7291354 recent negativity surrounding the outlook for the platinum price might have been overdone argues leon esterhuizen analyst at rbc capital markets
7291355 while the world economy is slowing leading to lower auto and jewellery sales and metal supply projected to expand we believe this need not ultimately be bad for platinum group metals
7291356 mr esterhuizen believes demand will continue to grow he notes that the diesel share of the asian car market is expanding and sees sales of european diesel electric hybrid car sales kicking in from 2009
7291357 he acknowledges that a real risk lies with jewellery demand but says the recent drop in the platinum price should offer some support he also does not expect to see the huge oversupply forecast by some observers

7291569 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7291570 es war ein schwieriges rennen unter sehr hei en bedingungen aber alles in allem denke ich dass wir eine gute leistung gezeigt haben
7291571 die strategie war nicht schlecht aber wir hatten ein safety car erwartet nachdem wir die anderen rennen im rahmenprogramm gesehen hatten
7291572 es gab jedoch keinerlei zwischenf lle so dass es nicht auf die strecke kam unsere geschwindigkeit war gut sie war nicht weit von jenen der anderen entfernt und wir haben mit dem getriebe einen schritt nach vorn gemacht wir m ssen nun fokussiert bleiben und weiterhin nach vorn schauen
7291573 der erste abschnitt des rennens war in ordnung da ich die l cke auf den rest des feldes schloss und ich in der haarnadelkurve ein paar autos berholen konnte
7291574 es war schade dass ich giancarlo nicht schnell genug berholen konnte um den kompletten vorteil aus der zwei boxenstopp strategie zu ziehen dabei verlor ich etwas zeit
7291575 als ich ihn erst einmal berholt hatte lief es besser aber es war dennoch schwierig mehr autos zu berholen beim bremsen verlor ich dann das heck des autos versuchte den unfall zu vermeiden aber die leitplanke war zu nahe und das war es dann
7291576 auch wenn es entt uschend war nicht zwei autos ins ziel zu bekommen sind beide fahrer exzellente rennen gefahren
7291577 die gute geschwindigkeit zeigte dass wir einen klaren schritt nach vorn gemacht haben adrian war ehrlich genug um zuzugeben dass er einen fehler gemacht hat aber bis zu diesem punkt hatte er ein sehr gutes rennen
7291578 wir hatten ein auto auf einen stopp und das andere auf zwei stopps gesetzt um im falle eines safety cars beide varianten abzudecken das wir f r dieses rennen erwartet hatten und w re er ins ziel gekommen dann w re adrian mit seinen zwei stopps in der lage gewesen genau hinter giancarlo ins ziel zu kommen alles in allem war es ein sehr positives wochenende f r das team
7291579 meiner meinung nach war dieses wochenende eines der konkurrenzf higsten f r das team bisher
7291580 wir hatten im training und im qualifying starke leistungen und nun zeigte ein sehr knappes rennen dass wir einen schritt nach vorn gemacht haben wir fahren nun gegen die anderen teams vor uns wir m ssen auf dem boden bleiben und in dieser richtung weiterarbeiten dann werden die ergebnisse kommen

7291599 he caught me with a couple of good shots i caught him body shots as well that probably didnt score

7291627 foi um bom resultado e um timo desempenho da equipe
7291628 o fim de semana come ou mal para mim mas acabou realmente bem hoje ent o estou feliz pude ter uma forte corrida sem atacar muito acelerei bastante quando precisei enquanto prestava aten o para tomar conta de pneus e freios

7291633 you come out every day and you see this monstrosity thing going on and youre compelled to do something
7291634 the rest of the block is beautiful its so sad youve got really huge mortgage companies that own title to these properties and arent cleaning them up
7291635 many of these buildings have been sitting vacant and unattended for five six 10 years
7291636 it was time for the city to push these investors these absentee landlords and in many cases banks to not just sit and wait for the market but to do something positive with these buildings so they wouldnt have a debilitating effect on the neighbors
7291637 we hope one of the offshoots of this ordinance is a greater incentive on the part of the banking community to work with people that are in the house
7291638 when you put a sign in front of your house thats the one they target to break in
7291639 thats an open invitation that this is the one that is vacant
7291640 how do we keep the people from going into properties how do we keep people from losing the properties
7291641 theyll start stealing those doors right now theyre stealing all metal from those properties
7291642 the biggest problem is you dont know who to call
7291643 you can make about 10 phone calls and not get anywhere
7291644 for me this is a huge opportunity to potentially bridge the gap between being a professional player and having a proper job as a coach
7291645 coaching was never a lifetime ambition for me but certainly at the end of the season i will be looking more into which direction i go in
7291646 i am learning a lot working alongside the ulster coaches and there is plenty of knowledge to draw on every day

7291656 ap s a classifica o escolhemos largar dos boxes e trabalhamos no carro para tentar resolver os problemas do dia anterior mudamos os freios completamente ent o o carro estava bastante diferente para pilotar
7291657 melhoramos um pouco durante a corrida mas precisamos ainda encontrar a solu o para as adversidades com os freios que nos atrapalham em todos os finais de semana e me custaram muito tempo e posi es sobretudo foi um fraco fim de semana
7291658 foi um bom resultado e uma tima performance do time
7291659 tive um in cio ruim por m finalizei bem hoje ent o estou feliz pude realizar uma prova consistente sem atacar muito
7291660 esses resultados mostram como nosso desempenho est bom e como temos um carro competitivo em cada final de semana estou confiante de que podemos manter esse desempenho nas pr ximas disputas
7291661 es hat keinen spa gemacht wir waren einfach zu langsam das war eines der schlimmsten rennen f r mich
7291662 es ist eine katastrophe mit einem auto auf platz neun zu landen das offensichtlich gut genug f r platz drei ist
7291663 wir hatten gehofft dass er beim start einen oder zwei pl tze gut machen w rde
7291664 leider ist er im gedr nge jedoch um einen rang zur ck gefallen damit war f r ihn das rennen gelaufen
7291665 wir hatten erwartet dass er wm punkte holen k nnte
7291666 danach hing ich hinter anderen autos fest aber das war meine schuld weil ich zu langsam war
7291667 er ist vor rosberg gestartet und hinter ihm ins ziel gekommen das ging definitiv nach hinten los langsam wird es eng f r ihn
7291668 zwei rennen in spanien und zwei ausf lle hoffentlich haben wir in spa mehr gl ck
7291669 es h tte ber eine stunde gedauert es zu reparieren
7291670 die erste runde war hart weil ich inmitten einer gruppe war und dabei einige positionen verlor
7291671 es ist schade dass wir nicht in die top10 gekommen sind aber ich hoffe auf ein besseres rennen in spa
7291672 wenn du eine ordentliche grippe hast dann siehst du nach 57 runden bei ber 30 grad wahrscheinlich auch so aus
7291673 da ist es mir schon ziemlich schlecht gegangen und das ganze rennen war ziemlich schwierig das einzige was ich machen konnte war so hart zu pushen wie es nur ging um konzentriert zu bleiben

7291700 the reason why some countries have been challenged with economic downturns after hosting an olympics is that hosting cities are often very small

7291711 we must view the punishment meted out for interpersonal offenses in a different manner it is not retribution in the sense of reward and punishment rather it is part and parcel of the reality our existence as surely as one must be hurt by a collision with another object so too must one be hurt when one has hurt anothers feelings when one puts his hand into a fire it will be burned countless good reasons for doing so notwithstanding

7291719 one of the best things about war is that its a huge iq booster the only people who use their brains in peacetime are the suits salesmen real estate agents the rest of us just slog along for the pay check get home and get on the computer so we can have a virtual war but once real war comes to town every guy turns into macgyver thinking up ways to convert harmless civilian items like alarm clocks and remotes into killing devices
7291720 the military feelings are too deeply grounded to abdicate their place among our ideals until better substitutes are offered than the glory and shame that come to nations as well as to individuals from the ups and downs of politics and the vicissitudes of trade

7291722 n r vi signet med tabu i sin tid var det med espen og erik r hne disse to sluttet bare et par m neder f r armada skulle ut i butikkene og det bidro til at vi mistet mye platesalg det var bare helt naturlig f lge br drene r hne som p kun 2 r har bygd opp norges sterkeste metal label men det er ogs visse markeder hvor de ikke har s bra kontroll som store selskaper som nuclear blast da var en lisensavtale med nb ogs helt naturlig nuclear blast har jo pr vd f tt oss i lang tid n men vi ville ikke signe direkte til dem da avtalen vi har med indie er mye bedre enn hva vi hadde f tt hos nb og det er greit ha en norsk label imellom til ta seg av detalj dealingen s man ikke blir helt overkj rt av et stort selskap
7291723 i dagens marked er det n dvendig og ta mer av kaka selv derfor bestemte vi oss for investere i eget studio isteden for svi av den samme summen p 3 4 uker i et annet studio ting funka bra p armada og vi ville pr ve det samme igjen men siden godt selskap studio var g tt konkurs ble det til at vi tok over hele studioet selv og kj pte inn noe nytt utstyr jeg synes det er viktig ha tid nok i studio til teste ut ideer og leke seg litt med diverse gitarer og s nn derfor er det bedre eie eget enn bruke alle pengene i et annet studio i tillegg vil man p lang sikt tjene inn det igjen siden man har mulighet til leie ut studioet sitt eller gj re andre produksjoner der vi jobber for tiden forresten med som er thrashmetal prosjektet v rt
7291724 den pressemeldingen er ikke helt korrekt kan du si jeg var ikke s rlig forn yd n r jeg s hvordan det var skrevet det jeg har gitt beskjed om til plateselskapet var at vi har g tt for en organisk produksjon med minimalt med editering etc trommer og gitarer er spilt inn for seg selv og jeg har lagt p flere spor med gitar etterhvert men vi har valgt beholde det menneskelige p plata ved ikke rette opp sm ting som normalt ville blitt editert f eks lot vi v re rette p noen tromme fills som havner litt bak klikket p tittelsporet jeg hadde en diskusjon med rune om vi skulle fikse dette men vi fant ut at det var bedre sl av klikket n r jeg skulle spille inn gitar s jeg fulgte trommene i all sin dynamikk isteden det ga mye mer feeling s nn jeg synes altfor mange plater i dag l ter plastikk og kjedelig pga at man ikke har noe s rpreg lenger det er lettere h re hvilket studio trommene er editert i enn hvilken trommis som spiller liksom slike produksjoner er veldig lett bli imponert over f rste gang man h rer dem men de mangler atmosf re og man blir lei etter f rste gjennomlytting
7291725 historien fortsetter p en m te p kolossus ja kort fortalt er det de som vant armada krigen som n tar steget videre og g r imot gudene for bringe ned gudene og bli guder selv
7291726 b de torstein og haakon er med p kolossus ogs denne gang har torstein v rt mer en konsulent n r det gjelder tekster og hele bandet har skrevet mye mer enn sist p armada var det torstein som skrev det meste men n har alle samme bidratt mye mer vi har vurdert ha med haakon live men noe fast synth medlem vil jeg ikke ha jeg er ogs skeptisk til ha synthist p scenen normalt ser ikke dette bra ut i det hele tatt jeg liker ogs at man er 4 p scenen det er mer symmetri i det og vi er fortsatt tross alt et metall band problemet er jo at man m kanskje ty til noen samples etc i en livesetting for f med hele lydbildet vi har testet en del s nne ting og vi er ganske n re til f det til l te fett uten ta med en ekstra mann dessuten synes jeg ikke et band trenger h res akkurat likt ut live som p plate jeg liker selv konserter hvor bandet gj r visse endringer p l tene og man f r noe annet enn p platen men vi jobber hele tiden med forbedre liveshowet v rt og visjonen er stor s n r vi har budsjett og mulighet til gj re store ting s er jeg sikker p at det kommer til bl se huet av de fleste men man m bare innse at man m ta et skritt av gangen og det tar tid bygge opp hele produksjonen
7291727 det er vel en viss drahjelp i det men tror nok heller det er at vi er annerledes enn andre norske band som gj r det det finnes nok av norske band som turnerer mye men ikke f r den omtalen vi har f tt for si det s nn s det v re fra norge er definitivt ikke nok
7291728 det betyr ingenting for oss v re en del av en scene
7291729 det var helt r tt de minste konsertene var som rockefeller liksom og vi merket at keep of kalessin er nok noe mer kjent der borte enn hva platesalg skulle tilsi men slik er det i dagens verden n r distribusjonen ikke holder m l laster folk ned platene det blir spennende se hva nuclear blast f r til der bort n og vi skal allerede tilbake i oktober b de dimmu borgir og behemoth var kule folk turnere med og vi ble gode kompiser med begge band tror alle var forn yd med lineupen p turneen og at en s ekstrem turn trakk s mye folk viser potensialet i markedet der borte definitivt den feteste turneen jeg noengang har v rt p
7291730 vi skal gj re noen festivaler i norge og tyskland i sommer og s blir det fullt kj r fra september med uk headlining turn ny usa turn skandinavia og metalfest tour i europa med

7291738 the shifts and changes we are describing here cannot be enacted through political action or deliberate intent they are born of a higher vibration and can only begin manifesting when humankind lets go of its addiction to ego centered control and simply begins to flow with the river of life that has always been within you the struggle and hardship of your limitation journey are just about complete your hearts are opening and becoming knit together through communication and your growing realization of who you really are

7291809 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
7291810 no this is the first time that i hurt it its not a strain or twist but i hurt the joint and just could not take off and it only aggravated when the qualifying round started i could neither run nor take off gt
7291811 probably it was not great but then i did not go full throttle all i wanted to do was to peak at the right time and give my best where it matters most unfortunately my ankle held me back

7291863 without seaside we may have become architects of a different sort
7291864 traditional architecture has more to do with the direction of architecture today than any radical modernist or rigid classicist would admit
7291865 classicism as an education is about learning the larger picture it is a systematic way to solve a problem
7291866 the classical is not about fluted shafts or polychrome pediments because classicism is not a style classicism is not a doctrine it is a philosophy of life it is the philosophy of free will nurtured by tradition what the classical claims is that there is and ought to be a balance between nature and man
7291867 the school allows the students to excel in professional practice the driehaus is the crown on that reputation

7291898 when i tell him i think he will understand and agree with me that i have vastly improved myself and it will make all the difference to how he feels about me
7291899 various western designers are influenced by the east they the designers always travel to the east for inspiration because we have such a rich culture rich colors and rich details
7291900 however the women of today are really becoming global dressers which is a bit sad because they are dropping traditional costumes being a designer i combine both aspects my designs have this festive indian connection but are very comfortable i specialize in fusing styles i dont do very traditional outfits
7291901 this type of embroidery can only be found and made there and is done by muslim women only they pass it down from generation to generation the women in the family usually did it in the past for one outfit it can take around a month to get it done
7291902 accessories are also important as they make the look complete i like simple clothing that is heavy on accessories again the east is rich in crafts that have to be sustained
7291903 in india more women are working in offices multinational companies and they prefer western outfits so i offer them clean and reasonable outfits i also design denim and casual lines
7291904 i dont want to be like those sensational designers who are just good in fashion shows and then make a hype in media but people cant really wear their clothes selling is really important i like my clothes to be worn by people thats why i like giorgio armani because he has this clean style and creates wearable clothes with different lines thats why he has survived for so long
7291905 fashion now is really ruled by the west i really hope that in the near future the east can take over because we are really rich you know
7291906 western designers are brilliant at marketing and promotion beside being financially well established so far only japanese designers are able to do it here

7291918 everyone looks up to me emotionally and on the field i take that as a compliment and i am trying to be the guy to get us over the hump
7291919 we play mus so you know we will have to have our game on they are always good we have already started breaking down their defense and they have some great ball players i cant wait to get an opportunity to play those guys if my ankle lets me it is going to be fun

7291990 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding trescothick writes
7291991 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7291992 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7291993 according to the laws this is illegal but we wont outlaw sucking sweets an icc spokesman told the bbc

7291995 but where do you stop for example if you start to try to stop everyone who is chewing gum
7291996 theres the second sound that tells me jan is alive
7291997 i had the flu when i arrived so i had pretty hard fevers pretty much every day and low energy
7291998 i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which kind of nearly did lead to me not racing this weekend
7291999 i only had it once i just woke up very very early yesterday before 5am yesterday and i had the spasm in my neck fortunately ive got a great doctor who was with me the whole way through it
7292000 it was so bad that i was struggling to basically stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers fortunately as i said i have a great trainer who helped pedro was looking forward to racing
7292001 no it wont be a problem again im pretty sure
7292002 it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track
7292003 my start was not so good on the dirty side and going into turn 1 i was right on the limit and very close to kimi and could defend my position against jarno for the first stint but he had a bit more fuel on board and stayed out an extra lap and he overtook me in the pits
7292004 but we can be very very happy with this result we made no mistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance the whole team can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races we can be in the top ten again
7292005 that was a very nice race apart from the fact that i touched with heidfeld which broke my wing which was a real shame as i had to do 17 laps like that losing around 20 seconds to the group i was in
7292006 the next two stints were good quality and i had a good pace
7292007 but i am happy with the result and i think we had the right strategy
7292008 it was a difficult race with the very hot conditions but overall i think it was a good performance
7292009 the strategy wasnt bad but we did expect a safety car after seeing the other support races but there werent any incidents so it didnt come
7292010 our pace was good it wasnt far off the others and we made a step forward with the gearbox we now have to keep focussed and keep moving forward
7292011 the first stint was ok as i was closing the gap to the rest of the field and then i could pass a few cars in the hairpin
7292012 it was a shame that i couldnt pass giancarlo quickly enough to take full advantage of the two stop strategy and lost a little time
7292013 but we can be very very happy with this result we made no mistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance the whole team can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races we can be in the top ten again
7292014 that was a very nice race apart from the fact that i touched with heidfeld which broke my wing which was a real shame as i had to do 17 laps like that losing around 20 seconds to the group i was in the next two stints were good quality and i had a good pace
7292015 but i am happy with the result and i think we had the right strategy its my best result since australia and especially from the second stint onwards i felt much more comfortable and confident with the car and felt i could push as the track rubbered in as for the next races i continue to tackle them one at a time and hope that next time out in spa i can make it into the points
7292016 it was a difficult race with the very hot conditions but overall i think it was a good performance the strategy wasnt bad but we did expect a safety car after seeing the other support races but there werent any incidents so it didnt come our pace was good it wasnt far off the others and we made a step forward with the gearbox we now have to keep focussed and keep moving forward
7292017 although it was disappointing not to get two cars to the finish both drivers drove excellent races with good pace showing wed made a clear step forward adrian was honest enough to admit he made a mistake but until that point he was having a very good race we had put one car on one stop and the other on two to cover all bases in case of a safety car which we were expecting for this race and had he finished adrian on his two stops would have been able to finish just behind giancarlo overall its been a very positive weekend for the team
7292018 it was at a stage of the game where we were paddling a little bit but i was a bit more disappointed when i snapped that other one but it got called back
7292019 probably one of the worst performances for a long time
7292020 we didnt have anybody in the rooms beforehand to keep it kind of normal and when we went out it smacked me in the face a bit to see all those guys there in the avenue
7292021 this suggests australias economy is going to collapse because the whole of the emissions intensive sector is in dire straits
7292022 it is a desirable thing to do and therefore it is not a bad thing for politicians to put petrol up by 10c a litre
7292023 for many brokers this year has been the first time they haveseen negative growth its been a real shock to the system
7292024 lenders are now dealing with only 20 to 30 broker groups instead of 200 as they were a year ago
7292025 our business is down 30 per cent and thats not even taking into account the big cuts in commissions from the banks
7292026 the cuts couldnt have come at a worse time because the mortgage market is really stretched
7292027 theyve cut broker commissions while raising interest rates independent of the reserve bank
7292028 its farcical for dr nelson to demand an economic statement at the very time he is trying to punch a multi billion dollar hole in our strong budget surplus by blocking key parts of it in the senate
7292029 playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7292030 taken together what were doing in tax coag and the emissions trading system represent a policy triangle of enduring reforms which will bolster that long run economic prosperity we need to build for future generations
7292031 this is an agenda that comes straight from what the prime minister likes to call the
7292032 it recognises australians are practical and a bit cautious about reform and they only trust it when it comes from the centre
7292033 this is why we will resist urgings to pick up radical agendas from the left or the right to shut down the coal industry for example or the car industry

7292038 evil takes root when one man starts to think that he is better than another
7292039 the surest defense against evil is extreme individualism originality of thinking whimsicality even if you will eccentricity that is something that cant be feigned faked imitated something even a seasoned imposter couldnt be happy with
7292040 life the way it really is is a battle not between bad and good but between bad and worse
7292041 audens lines those to whom evil is done do evil in return should be tattooed on every babys chest
7292042 it was 30 years and i just had it with the hauling down the expressway in the morning and stuck in traffic in the afternoon
7292043 i needed some money and i needed some structure in my routine
7292044 i didnt have enough spunk enough outside stimulation to rise from the couch and do anything useful
7292045 the only problem is i dont have enough time to do what i would like to do mostly the stuff at home as long as it works ill stay with it
7292046 you should do some financial planning and you should also do some planning ahead for personal enrichment you got to have some reason to get up in the morning plan some goals to achieve
7292047 its like any stage of your life hopefully longer than many
7292048 i joined a writing group at the harborfields library and went back to the pottery studio

7292051 phones are ever ready always on and always with you and you cant match that with a computer
7292052 anything they can see from a desktop computer they can see from their phone
7292053 a lot of our customers are doing text messaging at the point of sale with their debit cards in hand saying do i have enough money or dont i
7292054 said jim smith head of wells fargos internet services group
7292055 we want to encourage competitive sports in schools not the medals for all culture we have seen in previous years
7292056 it was wrong because it doesnt work in sport you get better by challenging yourself against other people a lot of sports are team games where people have to work together but they play against other teams
7292057 correct the tragic mistake of reducing the competitive element in school sports
7292058 she was not happy to settle for a silver she went full throttle for the gold i think that is the spirit we want to encourage in our schools
7292059 today is handover day at the olympics and people are going to be looking at what we are going to be doing in the next few years as london becomes the olympic city
7292060 we want our olympic legacy to be more than that to be about extending opportunity for sport extend it in schools giving children the opportunity to do sports they have never done before so that the next 10 years becomes a decade of sporting success for this country
7292061 we are prepared to put the money in even in these difficult economic times
7292062 it will inspire fitness and help tackle obesity what parents want to know is that when their children go to school they will be able to fulfill their dreams
7292063 by 2012 there will be a generation of children inspired by our heroes in beijing weve now got 19 gold medals this is a new opportunity to follow in their footsteps
7292064 i have met quite a lot of amateur boxers at one of the clubs i said to one of the young guys there who id been told had been in some trouble in the past tell me whats the most important thing you have learned here his answer was discipline
7292065 now it is 90 by the time of the london olympics in 2012 we want that number to be doing five hours a week
7292066 it wont be done at the cost of english or maths
7292067 it will be done in addition to the current curriculum just like after school clubs
7292068 the olympics can inspire people more people will give up smoking less people will become obese london will be different from beijing but they have set a very high standard
7292069 the only thing that cant happen is losing the battle against organized crime
7292070 united we mexicans have the capability of resolving our problems one by one
7292071 its like theyre saying now were going to do our jobs
7292072 we are sick of the way things seem to be out of control
7292073 perhaps it takes emblematic events to make us realize that the government is far from living up to its obligations

7292096 after discovering that thermal expansion of steel from a low temperature fire led to the collapse of world trade center building 7
7292097 we started realizing that other metal objects might also be at risk
7292098 we also determined that car engines airplane engines and boat engines could all suddenly fail due to thermal expansion
7292099 indeed we soon realized that almost all industrial processes could lead to catastrophic failure other than perhaps those used in freezers
7292100 once you understand this principle of thermal expansion you start to realize that even household showerheads and faucets are dangerous the hot water flowing through them could wreak havoc the president is committed to leading the way back to a safer time and a return to proven traditional materials which may not be flashy like metal but remain rock solid even when warm
7292101 everyone in the car was saying drive off drive off said officer joe rios a san antonio police department spokesman
7292102 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7292103 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7292104 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7292105 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7292106 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7292107 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7292108 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7292109 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7292110 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7292111 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7292112 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7292113 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7292114 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business
7292115 but then apply the same general principles to grades 10 through 12 so students arent faced with the same problems but just a year later
7292116 i know matts down because he didnt play as well as he would have liked
7292117 this competition being pushed by kurt has made matt tougher its one of the things you have to be as a quarterback
7292118 ive had a pretty traumatised weekend ive had a few problems health wise but seemed to pull through with a great team behind me who have helped me
7292119 its a nice new circuit weve come here and got some good points
7292120 me and the team heikki got some good points this weekend so overall it was a solid weekend for us
7292121 generally i dont really think this track is that physical it was just that it was hot you dont have enough water in the car really
7292122 its just been a very hot weekend and as you can see were in these big old suits and its like driving in a sauna
7292123 its a hectic one and half hour race but im pretty happy with the way i got through it
7292124 at the start i was on the dirty side and i think i got a reasonable decent start i was no where near as quick as felipe but just had to try and hold my spot
7292125 robert was pushing quite hard for the first few corners but after that it was pretty relaxed
7292126 i was able to try and attack and keep up with felipe
7292127 he was in front and its pretty difficult to overtake here so i thought id keep a certain gap and try to just maintain it but towards the end i think he started just to stretch it out just a little bit
7292128 but it was good to know we were a couple of laps heavier which balanced out and it really shows that weve got good pace
7292129 even today we want to proclaim this with innermost conviction
7292130 yes jesus you are christ the son of the living god we are aware that christ is the true treasure for whom it is worth sacrificing all he is the friend who never abandons us for he knows the innermost expectations of our heart jesus is the son of the living god the promised messiah who came on earth to offer humanity salvation and satisfy the thirst for life and love that dwells in every human being what advantages would humanity get if it welcomed the announcement that brings with it joy and peace
7292131 it is the first time that jesus spoke about the church whose mission is to implement gods grandiose plan to unite in christ the whole of humanity as a single family
7292132 before the huge responsibility of this task i feel ever more the importance and the duty of serving the church and the world that god placed in me for this reason i call upon you dear brothers and sisters to help me with your prayers so that faithful to christ we can together announce and bear witness to his presence in our times may mary enable us to obtain this grace we call upon her full of trust as the mother of the church and the star of evangelisation
7292133 these types of incidents happen regularly it is a daily event for all airlines he said
7292134 everything went well it was awesome its my longest flight with this wing if there are no technical problems its okay for the english channel
7292135 its a small world but i wouldnt want to paint it
7292136 if chairman murad is not willing or capable of bringing in his three milf commanders to answer for their terroristic acts then he and his men must stand down as government forces enforce the law short of that there will be no let up in the government offensive

7292142 about 5pm the temperature dropped drastically by 10 degrees from the high 30s ibrahims mother soraya ouaida said
7292143 with the changes of weather the ocean went a bit wild and sarah got pushed back by a wave and caught in a strong rip
7292144 but a child of eight what can he do its just too much for a little body an emotional ms ouaida recollected
7292145 all that time he kept smiling to her and saying youre going to be fine and i love you
7292146 please look after my sister my mother needs her shes very important before letting go
7292147 she always calls him her special angel and hero ms ouaida said
7292148 she writes poems about what happened and about her special brother who looked after her
7292149 the most important thing is having each other all the other things that people complain about are not really important
7292150 my main job is to defend but i got used to scoring a few at lille
7292151 i feel well integrated into this group and watching these players working hard for the coach i understand better why ol have been champions of france for the last seven years
7292152 we controlled the first half well despite a very dynamic grenoble side
7292153 its a shame we didnt score more goals that would have rewarded the work of our players
7292154 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
7292155 on the 360 version what we wanted was to have more immersion with the camera being really close to the player

7292184 the commonwealth should avoid further ad hoc policy tinkering and cherry picking of isolated reforms in private health insurance
7292185 it must be comprehensive and it must be linked to corresponding funding reforms to public sector health services
7292186 act health would therefore support consideration by the national health and hospital reform commission of any reforms that would see the redirection of the private health insurance rebate back into the public health system
7292187 only one lease supported by the previous national party government currently exists to mine shale oil and that is in gladstone
7292188 no new shale oil mines will be permitted anywhere in the state
7292189 global exploration managers already rank queensland as the least attractive jurisdiction in australia and this decision is only going to reinforce that perception
7292190 sovereign risk is a key consideration with billions of dollars at stake queensland has now effectively halted the development of two globally significant energy fuels in 15 months for the sake of local politics
7292191 the company remains convinced that developing the states strategically important oil shale resources is in the best long term interest of both queensland and australia
7292192 i dont envy ms bligh given the economic power of the greenhouse mafia but some time soon she is going to have to make the tough decision to put the future of the state ahead of the vested interests of the coal lobby
7292193 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
7292194 under australian law these children are australian citizens and the children of the adoptive parents
7292195 under the hague convention birth parents may bring an action in an australian court to have the adoption revoked
7292196 however any decision would be a matter for the courts which would apply the principle of protecting the best interests of the child
7292197 there are 50 000 americans living in sydney last election came down to around 500 votes in florida so we really want to highlight that every vote counts and americans living abroad should register to vote
7292198 this election has really inspired me to get involved for the first time i have actually tried to fundraise and connect with other democrats living here
7292199 we wanted to come out and be very positive and say we thank and honour them for their service to the country
7292200 i hope mr della bosca will be in a position sooner rather than later to resume his office and bring to bear the undoubted leadership experience and influence that he has hitherto displayed in negotiations with the commonwealth about the future shape of the industrial relations system
7292201 in his absence there may be a natural tendency for the commonwealth to feel less inclined to pay regard to states interests

7292376 i would say that next week in denver ill spend a lot of time talking to other democrats from across the state about intentions and gauging their reaction and support

7292378 im just going to be an active regular part of the delegation i know a lot of folks already and im hoping to get to know more

7292390 i called all the people i knew in middle tennessee politics
7292391 no one had tickets they were sort of left out
7292392 i have worked for him so i put a little pressure there
7292393 i kept calling and they said no were blocked off for dnc week
7292394 i talked to a friend of mine who was a really good buddy of al gores and he said he was going to try to get me some way to get in the convention during the week
7292395 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7292396 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7292397 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7292398 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7292399 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7292400 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7292401 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7292402 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7292403 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7292404 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7292405 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7292406 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7292407 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7292408 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7292409 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7292410 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7292411 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7292412 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7292413 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7292414 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7292415 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7292416 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7292417 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7292418 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7292419 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7292420 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7292421 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7292422 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7292423 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7292424 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7292425 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7292426 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7292427 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7292428 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7292429 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7292430 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7292431 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7292432 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7292433 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7292434 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7292435 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7292436 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7292437 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7292438 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7292439 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7292440 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7292441 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7292442 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
7292443 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7292444 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues
7292445 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7292446 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7292447 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7292448 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7292449 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7292450 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7292451 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7292452 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7292453 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7292454 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7292455 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7292456 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7292457 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7292458 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7292459 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7292460 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7292461 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7292462 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7292463 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7292464 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7292465 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7292466 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7292467 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7292468 so the goal is to get them thinking about wind and alternative energy as a career path
7292469 were a land grant institution dedicated to outreach and engineering
7292470 it makes sense to support this industry that will eventually help students find jobs in their own state and support this clean renewable energy industry
7292471 it seemed like the time was right for msu engineering and my department to step up and make a difference in alternative energy for environmental reasons and energy independence reasons
7292472 thats where students want to go and its the right place to go
7292473 yo ten a desde los 15 a os trabajando como modelo viajando por distintos pa ses del mundo pero quer a hacer algo como m s personal
7292474 la modelo vende m s la marca de un vestido de un producto la miss tiene la oportunidad de tener contacto con la gente de poder interactuar y mostrar su personalidad tambi n y sent que eso era lo que necesitaba y total que me fue buen simo

7292485 el show de los sue os sangre de mi sangre
7292486 me va muy bien ya tengo disco de platino por el lbum una rosa blu y la verdad es que hice un espacio en mi agenda de trabajo porque para m es muy importante fomentar la unidad familiar y qu mejor que a trav s de un programa que re ne las cualidades para sentar a todos a disfrutar sanamente de la televisi n
7292487 ella sabe que la aprecio mucho y que si no acept es porque tengo muchos compromisos que no se pueden cancelar e incluso ensayar por las ma anas para en la noche hacer mis presentaciones sabatinas y regresar muy temprano el domingo para estar lista
7292488 el show de los sue os sangre de mi sangre
7292489 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7292490 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7292491 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7292492 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7292493 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7292494 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7292495 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7292496 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7292497 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7292498 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7292499 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7292500 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7292501 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7292502 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7292503 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7292504 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7292505 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7292506 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7292507 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7292508 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7292509 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7292510 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7292511 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7292512 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7292513 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7292514 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7292515 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7292516 no sufro estr s porque conozco el s ndrome y s c mo combatirlo
7292517 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7292518 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7292519 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7292520 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7292521 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7292522 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7292523 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7292524 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7292525 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7292526 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7292527 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7292528 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7292529 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7292530 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7292531 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7292532 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7292533 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7292534 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7292535 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7292536 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7292537 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7292538 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7292539 right now more than ever we just cant afford insert here
7292540 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7292541 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7292542 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7292543 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7292544 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7292545 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7292546 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7292547 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7292548 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7292549 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7292550 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7292551 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7292552 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7292553 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7292554 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7292555 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7292556 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7292557 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7292558 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7292559 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7292560 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7292561 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7292562 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7292563 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7292564 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7292565 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7292566 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7292567 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7292568 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7292569 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7292570 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7292571 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7292572 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7292573 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7292574 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7292575 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7292576 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7292577 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7292578 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7292579 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7292580 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7292581 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7292582 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7292583 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7292584 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7292585 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7292586 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7292587 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7292588 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7292589 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7292590 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7292591 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7292592 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7292593 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7292594 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7292595 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7292596 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7292597 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7292598 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7292599 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7292600 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7292601 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

7292606 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7292607 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7292608 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7292609 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7292610 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7292618 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7292619 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7292620 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7292621 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7292622 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7292623 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7292624 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7292625 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7292626 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7292627 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something

7292629 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7292630 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7292631 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7292632 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7292633 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7292634 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7292635 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7292636 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7292637 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7292638 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7292639 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7292640 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7292641 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7292642 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7292643 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7292644 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7292645 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7292646 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7292647 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7292648 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7292649 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7292650 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7292651 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7292652 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7292653 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7292654 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7292655 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7292656 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7292657 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7292658 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7292659 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7292660 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7292661 youll hear people talking about zebra mussels and see their shells on the beach
7292662 what were finding is there are very very few zebra mussels
7292663 quagga mussels clear up the water and foul the bottom
7292664 anytime youre taking food out of the water column which is what both the quagga and zebra mussel do youre then taking food from something else
7292665 were starting to establish some new food chains and food webs within the great lakes ecosystem

7292919 at the beginning of the season we give all the professors class schedules to tell them what dates they are going to be gone

7292921 we like guys who are tough hard nosed aggressive guys who love to play football
7292922 this is a demanding program you have got to love it to endure the challenges we place on the players
7292923 i love seeing kids have a chance at college where if they didnt have football they might not be here and when they get here seeing them succeed the best thing is seeing them walk across that stage and graduate and going on and getting a job when they are done

7292939 francisco rodriguez will be out of the indians price range kerry wood likely will stay with the cubs but look for the indians to make runs at virtually every other closer on the market this offseason from brian fuentes to brandon lyon to rafael soriano class aaa right hander adam miller almost certainly will open the season in the indians bullpen if he is healthy but the tribe will need to add at least one veteran reliever and maybe more they also will need to use an internal option such as left hander zach jackson or righty anthony reyes in their rotation until right hander jake westbrook returns in the second half from tommy john surgery class aaa left hander david huff is another pitcher who could figure into the indians plans the yankees planned to take huff ahead of joba chamberlain in the sandwich round of the 2006 draft but the indians grabbed the lefty first huff is a combined 10 5 with a 2 39 era at class aa and aaa with 135 strikeouts and just 27 walks in 135 2 3 innings
7292940 with dempster he is definitely going to want to stay as a starter at one point last year lou mentioned putting him in the rotation very soon he got really excited in front of the media and wanted to do it asap lou decided that they wouldnt do it mid season smart idea by lou they told him in the offseason that they wouldnt guarantee him a rotation spot but that he could compete for one he was ready to go from day one this spring lost some weight and stretched his arm out i am sure that being a free agent season didnt hurt i dont know how much money he will demand but i think it will be substantial i could see 4 years 70 mil but that is a complete guess big teams are going to have money to spend this year and they will want to spend it on pitching the tough thing is that this is his first year back as a starter the cubs will want to sign him but might have ownership issues and might want to put the shark jeff samardzija in the rotation the other factor is how far they will go this year he has been their best starting pitcher by the numbers this year including z he will be high on the free agent list his public comments are that he wants to come back to chicago he has a sense of loyalty to them because they signed him while he was out with tommy john surgery put him in the closer role and then gave him the shot at the rotation
7292941 some with the indians however view santana as an even better prospect than class aa outfielder matt laporta the marquee player that cleveland received in the cc sabathia trade quality catchers are scarce if the dodgers had kept santana they could have used him in a bigger deal later or eventually moved martin to third base

7293229 eher auf die finanziellen eink nfte geguckt als auf das was an mehrwert an demokratie zu erreichen gewesen w re

7293232 i do think canada can get to the top 12 in 2012 but its going to take a big effort i do think there is a need for more investment
7293233 there were a number of events out there where we got a silver and i thought dammit just short of the gold
7293234 our ultimate objective at some time has to be how many gold medals will we win were certainly talking about that a lot more
7293235 we would appeal to prime minister stephen harper to give us the extra 6 million dollars wed asked for in the last budget
7293236 wed asked for 30 million lets look at the extra 50 or 60 million were going to need over the next few years to try and build the kinds of programs theyve got in britain and australia and the united states
7293237 if were going to play with the big boys if were going to be a g8 nation lets be g8 at all levels
7293238 its definitely hard to compete with the top countries especially when you look at diving trampoline and gymnastics
7293239 it was so difficult to compete against the chinese athletes here and the programs they have in place are just amazing
7293240 funding has to come early enough that theres time for the athletes to prepare and have access to everything they need and the support they need to compete with the top countries in the world were already seeing small improvements and hopefully its going to continue that way
7293241 we made a decision some time ago to start targeting the money and we realized we couldnt be a mile wide and an inch deep
7293242 australia targets the sports where they know they can get medals
7293243 im not sure we can ever be as targeted as that and i dont think canadians would accept that we have a certain egalitarian nature that is going to demand that every kid gets a chance but we can target more than we have in the past
7293244 the more you see of these tremendous young people the more you want to see of them but if you dont see them and you dont know who they are there isnt that passion to watch them
7293245 its tough enough in the ups and downs of the olympics world its another game in the ups and downs of the political world
7293246 athletes are training to perform in the sports world we would be very careful how they might be used in the political field
7293247 fehlt nur noch der zusatz da musst du jetzt aber sehr brav sein
7293248 sechs und siebenj hrige brauchen einfach noch ausreichend schlaf und sollten nicht abgestrudelt in die schule kommen
7293249 sie sollen nicht vom ballett zum reiten und in die musikschule hetzen wie kleine manager
7293250 die schulf higkeit ist gegeben wenn sich kinder in gemeinschaft gleichaltriger die traditionellen kulturg ter durch planm iges arbeiten aneignen k nnen
7293251 kinder haben ein nat rliches interesse am umgang mit gleichaltrigen
7293252 man tut ihnen also nichts b ses wenn man sie in einen kindergarten gibt
7293253 kinder sind neugierig sie haben freude daran etwas zu erfahren
7293254 der kindergarten wird zu wenig ernst genommen wenn es hei t das ist ja nur spielen
7293255 auch in der schule ist ein wesentlicher faktor des lernens das spiel
7293256 kinder erfahren dass man geborgenheit n he und zuwendung auch f r andere kinder empfinden kann
7293257 das sollte so fr h wie m glich kompensiert werden
7293258 der wortschatz ist sehr stark schichtspezifisch akademiker verwenden mehr worte und differenzieren begriffe feiner
7293259 keine angst vor der schule machen zeigen wie viel freude es macht etwas zu k nnen zu vermitteln dass jeder einmal fehler macht damit bereitet man das kind darauf vor dass es nicht nur lob erhalten wird und f hrt es so an ein konstruktives lernen heran
7293260 insurers would have to issue every applicant a policy and charge fair and stable premiums that will not depend upon health status the exchange will require that all the plans offered are at least as generous as the new public plan and have the same standards for quality and efficiency the exchange would evaluate plans and make the differences among the plans including cost of services public
7293261 we must not deny any patient access to essential health care based on ability to pay nor should we deny access based on a shortage of doctors hospital beds or operating time
7293262 competition consumer choice and market principles barely exist in our health system the cma president is asking for the basic principles that stimulate organizations to work properly
7293263 lets note that three of the main olympic values excellence universality sustainability are similar to our values and aspirations for a truly great health system
7293264 and of course an integral part of the olympics is competition
7293265 i believe that if we are to preserve universal health care for the next generation we need to embrace similar principles
7293266 and he bemoaned the fact that more than one million canadians were on waiting lists for health care and that five million people did not have access to a family doctor yet neither the governing conservatives nor the liberal opposition seemed to care he charged
7293267 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health care system
7293268 rationing of services in the nhs is a fact of life doctors insisted the british medical association said a postcode lottery operates nationwide with some treatments denied to patients simply because of where they live
7293269 thousands of elderly people with broken bones caused by falls are being betrayed by a postcode lottery in nhs care
7293270 this year one of my goals is not to stress just kind of let life come as it is im going to try and do that a little more just take things step by step instead of always having a plan
7293271 now that the bridge is open people can cross the bridge and get to the other side in five minutes
7293272 when al qaeda came they realized that the bridge was dangerous to them and blew it up to cut off the supply going across
7293273 we have been chasing al qaeda across this area and are working to keep the new bridge safe
7293274 we like our blogging buddies we like them very much
7293275 when we started this effort it was the only way for us to be able to vote in denver to represent the people who elected us
7293276 were proud of what we did were going to see it to the end just like our candidate we dont quit
7293277 since we never consulted with senator clintons campaign we dont know if the petition that wouldnt die had anything to do with the two joint campaign announcements made last week we will probably never know but it certainly made us feel good
7293278 i wasnt sure going into the race that we had the pace to win but i was able to pass edwards on lap 7 just a few seconds before a full course yellow came out when the race went green again for a couple of laps i was able to hold him off then we had that final incident and the race ended under yellow
7293279 we want to encourage competitive sports in schools not the medals for all culture we have seen in previous years
7293280 it was wrong because it doesnt work in sport you get better by challenging yourself against other people a lot of sports are team games where people have to work together but they play against other teams
7293281 correct the tragic mistake of reducing the competitive element in school sports
7293282 she was not happy to settle for a silver she went full throttle for the gold i think that is the spirit we want to encourage in our schools
7293283 today is handover day at the olympics and people are going to be looking at what we are going to be doing in the next few years as london becomes the olympic city
7293284 we want our olympic legacy to be more than that to be about extending opportunity for sport extend it in schools giving children the opportunity to do sports they have never done before so that the next 10 years becomes a decade of sporting success for this country
7293285 we are prepared to put the money in even in these difficult economic times
7293286 it will inspire fitness and help tackle obesity what parents want to know is that when their children go to school they will be able to fulfill their dreams
7293287 by 2012 there will be a generation of children inspired by our heroes in beijing weve now got 19 gold medals this is a new opportunity to follow in their footsteps
7293288 i have met quite a lot of amateur boxers at one of the clubs i said to one of the young guys there who id been told had been in some trouble in the past tell me whats the most important thing you have learned here his answer was discipline
7293289 now it is 90 by the time of the london olympics in 2012 we want that number to be doing five hours a week
7293290 it wont be done at the cost of english or maths
7293291 it will be done in addition to the current curriculum just like after school clubs
7293292 the olympics can inspire people more people will give up smoking less people will become obese london will be different from beijing but they have set a very high standard
7293293 i had a pt today who had a crack induced stroke her goal was to be able to put into a mens g string again hahahahahah help me think of a good treatment activity for that one
7293294 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7293295 who will you trust more two senators with no private sector experience or a proven ceo
7293296 humidity is the experience of looking for air and finding water
7293297 we keep track of the humidity in the air so we wont drown when we breathe
7293298 hey im sorry i was a jerk please accept my apology lunch on me
7293299 it provides propaganda to the taliban if they dont take responsibility
7293300 against the insidious wiles of foreign influence a free people ought to be constantly awake
7293301 more than 1 5 billion in private u s funds go to israel annually
7293302 its pleasing and encouraging that people are taking it into consideration before going to the football whether they are going to drink or drive
7293303 we got there just after three quarter time and made ourselves known we were there
7293304 we have got some very exciting new events as well as a number of our old faithfuls that we are running this year
7293305 we are hoping to raise more than 40 000 because of the requests we have had to support some bigger organisations
7293306 its their lifeblood each of the organisations all say if they didnt receive that money they wouldnt be able to continue to support people
7293307 we wanted to run a lot of the events outdoors especially utilising the skate park and the risk and expense was a huge problem
7293308 national youth week is also held at that time of year so wed be keen to tap into some of the funding that becomes available
7293309 its become evident that we need to step up and think of why and how we can make it a festival more so than the past nine years
7293310 we want unique bands things you would never think would come to ballarat
7293311 weve got a better lead in time and better staff than ever before
7293312 we really want to invest in a committee now to start planning the festival
7293313 probably had little idea of the stir they would make
7293314 to be used in whatever way was thought to best add to the pleasure of the lads
7293315 please buy a pair of new boots because my boots have worn though
7293316 the issue is mainly about public safety you will find a lot of family groups will take their young kids out walking and motorbikes probably dont slow down and it potentially causes a risk
7293317 walking tracks are considered off road and thats where they are going because its perceived to be better riding
7293318 its a sport that has taken off in the last few years that is becoming more popular and people are looking to take their bikes into better places
7293319 a small minority of these riders are people who go out bush and cause untold environmental damage and a lot are unlicensed and unregistered
7293320 they do realise they have to be licensed and registered but they just take the gamble and think they can do it
7293321 its this time of year that they do get out there a lot more with cooler weather and slippery conditions and it just seems to be a magnet
7293322 the next thing is we have got to find a shed that is 30 metres by five metres wide to get it spray painted and thats our next big appeal
7293323 this is the biggest milestone we are probably 75 per cent complete and we have got to now put the decking on and seats and we have got to put cabling on
7293324 so far we have spent 235 000 and its going to cost us 50 000 to finish it
7293325 we are appealing for anymore donations that can come in its an important icon to ballarat the city and its history because everybody shed tears when the old one got burned down now this one is to replace it
7293326 paddle steamers have been a part of the history of lake wendouree since 1885 we want to have it floated by christmas this year we only need 18 inches of water
7293327 general opinion in the party is in favour of parting ways
7293328 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7293329 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7293330 i am also willing to contest the presidential election but i am bound to obey what the party decides
7293331 had to be seen by any serious observer as trying to substitute a western sphere of influence for russian
7293332 a kind of glorified organisation for security and cooperation in europe
7293333 making trouble on everything in order to have some leverage
7293334 i think it was a case of wanting to get georgia engaged before the window of opportunity closed
7293335 are not capable of enforcing the taiwan model in georgia their army in the caucasus is not strong enough to calm down the situation in their own territory i dont think they are ready for any kind of an adventure in somebody elses territory and hopefully they know it
7293336 and whoever is perpetrating it and ive mentioned this to the president there should not be violence
7293337 saakashvilis buddies in the white house and the office of the vice president kept egging him on
7293338 perils of dominance imbalance of power and the road to war in vietnam
7293339 i was in bed asleep and my son was here and he was about to go to bed and he said he just felt the house shake and he didnt know what it was
7293340 a lady from over the corner she came in screaming and crying and would not let me go out the front because the car was right up at the window
7293341 i was more concerned about my dog who was on the bed with me
7293342 i have always had insurance but being on a pension i couldnt afford the high one
7293343 but the insurance company has told me im completely covered i am surprised at the damage im shocked fair enough the outside but not the bedrooms i was so close only a foot and a half from all the smashed windows
7293344 they probably got that result because they wanted it a bit more and did the horrible things more than my players
7293345 the customer is not always right thats why theyre calling us after all
7293346 one the interesting thing about the marathon is that whether you do it in 3h10 4h10 or even 5h10 its the same experience
7293347 well its going to take him all day at that pace
7293348 the ppa is honored to have these talented actors join us in raising much needed funds for those who have fought to protect our country we look forward to a great event and encourage everyone to donate to this worthy cause and thank our nations veterans for their service
7293349 its quickly becoming a very popular way to build next generation applications theres a lot of interest in capturing the hearts and minds of developers
7293350 nach dem ausgleich haben wir unsere qualit ten gezeigt es war genau diese siegermentalit t die wir die ganze saison zeigen wollen
7293351 das war eine entt uschung fulham war motivierter und aggressiver vor allem in der ersten halbzeit
7293352 nessuno lo pu sapere con precisione ma i fogli di giornale che sono nel suo stesso strato di rifiuti sono datati marzo 1988
7293353 venti anni sepolto sotto i rifiuti cosa diremo adesso alla gente
7293354 non il primo ritrovamento di angeli che avviene il vaticano per non vuole che si sappia questo il terzo gli altri due corpi li tengono custoditi in una cripta hanno fatto gli esami al carbonio quattordici i loro corpi hanno oltre diecimila anni ne hanno trovato uno in palestina laltro in germania questo il terzo
7293355 lo prenderanno lo porteranno nella cripta insieme agli altri e non ci sar pi nessuna possibilit di rivederlo
7293356 non lo so lidea che mi sono fatto che gli angeli siano il simbolo della bellezza perduta la bellezza un dono del signore
7293357 he was just playing deep and i kind of had to wait a little bit to throw the ball
7293358 obviously i dont want to hit him in his back while hes still running to the bag he likes to play back i have to get used to timing it almost
7293359 it would have been nice to go in one run down and see if we could have rallied
7293360 a couple of feet over and its an out i thought we had a chance because the ball wasnt hit very hard
7293361 it would have been a tough one run save for the other side
7293362 if they get it you tip your cap but that would have been a tough save you cant give a club an extra out at that time in the game
7293363 all the credit goes to them anybody could have pitched today
7293364 to be able to spot the ball the way he did and mix things up its hard to believe he could be that sharp with that much time missed
7293365 it was one of those nights where whatever we did was going to be right and whatever they did was going to be wrong
7293366 it was just nice to get some offense for wainwright and give him a little breathing room
7293367 esperamos por el bien de todos nuestros fans en israel que esta vez la fortuna les sonr a y finalmente puedan ver a depeche mode actuando en su patria

7293377 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7293378 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7293379 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7293380 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7293381 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7293382 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7293383 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7293384 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7293385 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7293386 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7293387 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7293388 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7293389 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7293390 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7293391 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7293392 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7293393 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7293394 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7293395 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7293396 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7293397 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7293398 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7293399 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7293400 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7293401 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7293402 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7293403 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7293404 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7293405 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7293406 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7293407 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7293408 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7293409 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7293410 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7293411 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7293412 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7293413 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7293414 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7293415 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7293416 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7293417 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7293418 the goal is to bring down the walls of the convention and invite in an audience thats as large as possible
7293419 credentialing more bloggers opens up all sorts of new audiences
7293420 this is stuff we deserve we helped the party get people elected
7293421 maybe in 2004 it was about being accommodating and innovative but this time around theres a real fight for power in the party
7293422 its a recognition from the d n c of the work that youve done of your import your significance
7293423 we were the site the d n c was talking about we just assumed we would get it
7293424 nobody here certainly not i believes theres only one good blog in every state
7293425 its unprecedented access for bloggers yes but its certainly not equal access
7293426 this is very reminiscent of being at the low end of the totem pole
7293427 student led collaborative inquiry and involvement enlists their enthusiasm in ways that even very good lectures and texts dont
7293428 im safe in my little niche hidden behind my laptop one of many scanned by the professor
7293429 everyone can see me and were all exposed to each other
7293430 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7293431 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7293432 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7293433 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7293434 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7293435 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7293436 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7293437 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7293438 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7293439 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7293440 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7293441 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7293442 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7293443 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7293444 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7293445 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7293446 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7293447 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7293448 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7293449 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7293450 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7293451 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7293452 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7293453 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7293454 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7293455 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7293456 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7293457 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7293458 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7293459 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7293460 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7293461 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7293462 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7293463 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change

7293499 keep coming keep coming keep coming at bat after at bat at bat after at bat
7293500 youve got to be cold blooded to be in that situation and actually only focus on seeing the ball and staying in your zone
7293501 i knew he was a great pitcher with a great fastball
7293502 he throws real hard but i knew the situation with the bases loaded i was trying to get the runs in at the time
7293503 that was one of the toughest games for me in my career one of the toughest that ive lost
7293504 just being ahead like that and boom we lost it was just a tough game to swallow
7293505 amazing great job to be able to get to him in that inning and get to the bullpen it says a lot about how much our guys battled at bat for at bat

7293539 hey chris what do you think about playing against your teammates kobe and gasol
7293540 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7293541 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7293542 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7293543 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7293544 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7293545 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7293546 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7293547 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7293548 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7293549 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7293550 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7293551 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7293552 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7293553 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7293554 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7293555 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7293556 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7293557 freezing in the dark money power politics and the vast left wing conspiracy
7293558 a philosophy of failure the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery

7293560 the soros mishmash of leftist causes at home ranged from financing the anti gun lobby to abolishing capital punishment from anti israel activism to promoting abortion rights from feminism population control and gay liberation to anti corporate campaigns radical theories of education and replacing national sovereignty with global institutions
7293561 hard work duty and obligation self reliance high levels of national pride pro life values rejection of homosexuality belief in the importance of religion and god in ones life and that children should learn respect and obedience
7293562 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world

7293564 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7293565 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7293566 it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold

7293572 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something

7293593 if a face and a voice can help spread the message then im more than happy to be that face and voice
7293594 of all the ways in which we tried to game out what rock bottom would look like even we would not have anticipated that two septuagenarians would be sentenced to re education through labour while the games were going on
7293595 the chinese government continues to give us an endless stream of material to work with and has an incredible tin ear
7293596 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labour camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7293597 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7293598 the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7293599 people walking on the street are so happy so optimistic about their own tomorrow the athletes are happy about their performance about the competition about everything they see
7293600 there is one narrative that is the accepted narrative if you are on board with that narrative you can fully enjoy the games you can get excited by the chinese gold medals you can be part of this national project
7293601 its been something ive always wanted to have in a convention hall
7293602 by dogged reporting loose lipped party insiders and the limits of technology

7293607 you dream about winning a gold medal weve based so much of our lives into this pursuit and to have it pay dividends is amazing and of course ive been kind of as ive been saying compartmentalizing so much of my emotion the last couple of weeks so finally the filters kind of came down
7293608 i didnt get the chance to see him right after the match because i think he took some time to himself to deal with things the way he needed to deal with them

7293617 fig tells us however they want to examine them thoroughly because they are established in chinese of course and they will report to us as soon as possible
7293618 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared
7293619 however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7293620 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7293621 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed
7293622 it is the commonest cancer in india and all sexually active women are at a risk of contracting this disease but its mostly seen in woman aged between 50 to 55 years if detected at a pre cancerous stage when the cells are not normal but are not yet cancerous this cancer is 100 per cent curable
7293623 although this vaccine has proved quite effective we still need to follow up to see for how long the immunity lasts

7293628 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7293629 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7293630 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7293631 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7293632 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7293633 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7293634 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy than 98 percent of us
7293635 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7293636 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7293637 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot

7293666 gee i dont know if it really is a human life you know maybe i should go on birth control or something
7293667 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now and the olympics think about the amount of money that china has spent on infrastructure their ports their train systems their airports are all vastly superior to us now which means if youre a corporation deciding where to do business youre starting to think beijing looks like a pretty good option
7293668 w e make so much music that sometimes waiting for album to be released for folks to peep is too long we may be on to something completely different by then and those tracks may not get used so its good to leak em out so they get heard and people can have something in between projects
7293669 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7293670 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7293671 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7293672 they came to us with that option which had been done in other parishes in the area and we thought it was a good idea
7293673 but as time went on they kept moving the goal posts and asking us to make more and more compromises
7293674 eventually the only choice we were given was to relocate or disband
7293675 all money spent on three courts a clubhouse and lights was raised by club members and to be offered 3500 to go away is a disgrace
7293676 about 5pm the temperature dropped drastically by 10 degrees from the high 30s

7293680 please look after my sister my mother needs her shes very important
7293681 clare you faced your death with dignity strength and courage
7293682 you knew you were on a journey and you made a decision to make a difference
7293683 your story was told with energy and conviction your words and actions made a difference to the lives of others especially young people just like you
7293684 if i could go back and talk to myself when i was 19 i would tell that girl not to use a solarium that melanoma is not a small cancer that you just have cut out and you will be fine
7293685 i may pass in another week or it could be two if i really fight it out i may even have six weeks left
7293686 i have never been one to keep my silence about anything i have felt passionate about
7293687 melanoma is no joke and i will keep championing this cause till the day i take my last breath
7293688 its wonderful what clare oliver has achieved in the last 12 months particularly considering that just three weeks after her last birthday she sadly passed away
7293689 she has changed the way the community thinks about solariums which is a wonderful achievement

7293706 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7293707 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7293708 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7293709 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7293710 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7293711 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7293712 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7293713 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7293714 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being
7293715 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7293716 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7293717 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7293718 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7293724 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7293725 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7293726 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7293727 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7293728 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7293729 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7293730 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7293731 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7293735 substantial gains could be realised from consolidating the many ftas into a single region wide one

7293743 our management has been talking with a variety of potential investors this week
7293744 most parties would look at it as the us government stepping in and guaranteeing the obligations of fannie and freddie
7293745 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7293746 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7293747 the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7293748 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7293749 when you can get an adverse feedback loop that argues that what you need to do is act more aggressively
7293750 we will have to see where it will go it is too early to give a comment on that

7293760 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7293761 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7293762 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7293763 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts

7293770 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7293771 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7293772 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7293773 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

7293780 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7293781 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7293782 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7293783 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7293784 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7293785 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7293786 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7293787 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7293788 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7293789 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7293790 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7293791 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7293792 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7293793 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7293794 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7293795 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7293796 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7293797 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7293798 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7293799 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7293800 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7293801 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7293802 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7293803 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7293804 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7293805 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7293806 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7293807 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7293808 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7293809 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7293810 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7293811 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7293812 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7293813 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7293814 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7293815 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7293816 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7293817 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7293818 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7293819 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7293820 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7293821 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7293822 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7293823 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7293824 who are open to doing something on the production side
7293825 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7293826 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7293827 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7293828 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7293829 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7293830 the number of prescriptions claimed on medicare does not accurately reflect the number of patients being treated and therefore no conclusions can be drawn

7293832 margaret told me she was very concerned for kens safety
7293833 i feel sorry for them its our clubs goal to raise people in our community via the australian way of life that amplifies tolerance and understanding
7293834 i want them to know that despite their efforts to cause pain and destroy our way of life our club and community have only become bigger and stronger
7293835 before the bombings our tiny club had 30 members and there was a chance of it folding now we have over to 300 members including 300 players in 12 footy and four girls netball teams
7293836 in dreams and in my waking i can tell you how she is growing older what she looks like now i can see she is still with us i dont want to believe she is gone
7293837 i have 10 children and one of them is missing you dont know if she is alive or where she is i feel she is close to me but where i cant tell you i feel like she is coming home any time
7293838 she went from there to here and i was saying come on rahma come on rahma and she came to me
7293839 if you missed her for five minutes she would be playing in the flowers
7293840 he would start to cry we looked and she had taken his dummy i said to herrahma have you seen your brothers dummy in arabic and she would answer in english no
7293841 if you have a baby you can feel it you know how much you love your son and your daughter and how much you love your children and to have them next to you

7293845 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
7293846 what do i have to do not to get arrested
7293847 als er zoveel slechte dingen zijn is er dan wel een god

7293980 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
7293981 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
7293982 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
7293983 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
7293984 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth
7293985 dont be afraid of your material or your past be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you be afraid of not getting your writing done
7293986 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
7293987 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
7293988 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
7293989 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

7293994 we will make a political decision in due course on where we go beyond 400
7293995 on the basis of the results and the demand the only issue is how far
7293996 we have 100 opening in 2010 there will be very strong pressure from parents and local authorities to maintain that rate
7293997 my motto as an ardent blairite is in the masters words what matters is what works
7293998 the problem is that the higher the burden of taxation the less opportunity there is for growth
7293999 if you want to get further growth then the state has got to take less from people in tax
7294000 as you reduce the levels of taxation you will get growth
7294001 just as the country is having to tighten its belt clearly we are going to have to look at priorities for public expenditure
7294002 we have reached the limits and in my view we have got to make economies
7294003 i think we have reached the end of the road the british people are well ahead of the politicians on this and know that the money is not being spent wisely
7294004 it is up to the leadership of the conservative party how they present these things
7294005 but the facts of life are if you allow public expenditure to grow more rapidly peoples living standards will continue to fall and our ability to recover will diminish
7294006 therefore we need to do in government what people are doing in their business and private lives which is to cut out cloth
7294007 obviously a conservative administration will have to undertake a policy of economic recovery
7294008 im afraid its going to get worse before it gets better
7294009 the situation now is the result of this governments overspending overborrowing and overtaxing
7294010 there are areas where you could stop spending on unnecessary programmes which will start to relieve pressure we can cut back on things
7294011 david cameron and george osborne have already promised more than 10 billion in unfunded tax pledges and have welcomed the redwood and forsyth reports advocating even more unfunded tax cuts
7294012 but at the same time the conservative frontbench keep making massive extra spending promises

7294019 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7294020 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7294021 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7294022 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp

7294112 kurz nach dem start fuhr mir nakajima ins auto und ich verlor meinen heckfl gel meine mechaniker versuchten alles damit ich weiterfahren konnte doch mein rennen war gelaufen ich bin sehr entt uscht weil ich bei meinem zweiten heimrennen auf ein besonderes erlebnis gehofft hatte und mich an diesem wochenende so viele fans unterst tzten ich m chte mich jetzt voll auf den rest der saison und das n chste rennen in spa konzentrieren
7294113 die erste runde verlief turbulent weil ich mitten in einer kampfgruppe steckte und mehrere pl tze verlor
7294114 danach versuchte ich die positionen zur ckzugewinnen doch mein frontfl gel war so besch digt dass ich kaum berholen konnte schade dass wir keinen top 10 platz schafften aber ich hoffe dass wir in belgien in zwei wochen ein besseres rennen erleben
7294115 unser ziel bleibt trotzdem der vierte platz in der konstrukteurs weltmeisterschaft wir m ssen uns jetzt ganz auf die kommenden rennen konzentrieren und unsere anstrengungen noch verst rken
7294116 es ist sehr entt uschend diese wunderbare neue strecke ohne punkte verlassen zu m ssen
7294117 besonders leid tut es uns f r fernando in seinem heimrennen trotz allem m ssen wir jetzt nach vorne schauen und schon ans n chste rennen denken
7294118 you miss 100 percent of all the shots you never take
7294119 unser ziel war mit m glichst wenig risiko in die punkte zu fahren
7294120 das ist uns mit zwei podestpl tzen sogar viel besser gelungen als ich vorher gedacht h tte

7294124 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco at a cost of millions of pounds to the uk taxpayer this will destroy any grain of confidence the public still have in this white elephant

7294343 i got into it seven years ago after playing a home game with some friends and managed to win my first game i thought this is easy and have since learnt that nothing could be further from the truth after that i played online quite a lot until recently when ladbrokes came along and ive been playing more live
7294344 online is a lot easier for me because no one can see you and i pretend to be a man so nobody picks on me i played at the ladbrokes european ladies championship and it was quite nervous that everyone would be wondering what i was doing there but luckily everyone was really nice
7294345 ante up for africa was like any other tournament except i had eric seidel andy bloch dan shak and ben affleck at my table i went out with a bang i played really aggressively i learnt a lot from watching annette obrestad at the elc and although i would never even attempt to compare myself to her she did show me how important it was to be aggressive i busted very early
7294346 some players dont realise how much work we are doing to help the game we promote it to audiences that dont play poker and its bringing a lot more money into the game which helps everybody in particular we are helping lots of women pick up the game which is really important to me i work really hard doing interviews round the clock while we are out here and try to promote the game as much as i can

7294353 tre stallings knee or ankle rolled but that was about the only one injury wise
7294354 as far as the game they came out an established the line of scrimmage on both sides of the football they did a good job their quarterback made some good plays with his legs and got them down the field but i though we did a pretty good job with the goal line situation we didnt let them in just offensively our first two possessions we were at the minus two and minus 11 and we couldnt really get out of that but we didnt move the ball this was a setback for us we have been playing fairly decent first half of football games and we didnt do that this week we did not do that for some reason i do not know but we have a week to fix it
7294355 its disappointing in the fact that we had a good week again of practice but it just seemed like we couldnt get out of our own way some things happen in the game but they happen and you have to overcome those things i thought it settled down for a while but then we had a bad punt which they run back for a touchdown that gives them some more momentum and it just kept rolling from there we moved the ball some offensively but we slowed down we had some opportunities but they just beat us physically on both sides of the ball
7294356 no no i did not because i thought we had a good week and like i said the last two weeks we played halfway decent and i thought we would do that this week but it didnt happen
7294357 were going to have to play a whole lot better i think these guys were embarrassed about how they played and why it happened i dont know its not like we didnt prepare its not like they didnt want to play well they just didnt i dont want to take anything away from the dolphins they did a good job they came out they did some things on the run and hit our quarterback which is never a good sign when they start hitting your quarterback and they covered us they doubled us and played man to man and we didnt even have time to get to the next guy
7294358 i thought nick novak would have made that one it would have been nice if he made that so were still evaluating
7294359 it was a setback obviously we wanted to go out there and have a good showing score points and win the game we just kind of shot ourselves in the foot in the first half we started out with some bad field position when we did get something going we would do something to mess it up we came out in the third quarter drove all the way down there and it was just kind of the mood for the night we went down there and stalled at the one its stuff we cant do and we have got to improve on not only next week but against the patriots
7294360 i was talking to all the guys on the sideline and i kept telling them we are going to be a good football team
7294361 i dont know its pretty tough when you dont score any points and you turn the ball over like we did we took a step back tonight like herm said fortunately it is a preseason game and we still have a lot of time here before the start of the regular season hopefully we can get on that practice field and get some things turned around in a hurry
7294362 seven and nine wont agree to exclude three or more its now possible to change the survey dates on a daily basis so it doesnt have to be a complete week
7294363 its appropriate to break out the unusually big events so we can have year on year comparisons
7294364 do we exclude christmas day fathers day mothers day and your birthday business does not stop because the olympics are on its a true and accurate measure of what peoples behaviour is and thats what the ratings are for what other industry in the world says we wont include those bad weeks because our sales figures werent good
7294365 we expect the closing ceremony will skew the whole of that week
7294366 a 40 week season regardless of events were sure millions of australians would find it perplexing that the nine network chooses to believe that the olympic games did not occur this year
7294367 we will be reporting weeks 7 48 including and excluding the 16 days of the olympic games and quite possibly the rugby league world cup on nine
7294368 not because they are trying to sell a product but because the government and the police select what stories we should cover and with what angle and what sources
7294369 if theres a big demonstration and the cops say there are 20 000 and the organisers say 100 000 well go for the 20 000

7294371 the honourable convention aimed at unearthing the facts has become a cowards compromise aimed at dispatching quick copy with which nobody will quarrel
7294372 patterns of distortion so consistent as to amount to bias against the truth
7294373 all sorts of strange things are at work there part of it has to do with the death of socialism and the narrowing of the political spectrum so that theres almost no difference between politicians on either side and therefore there is far less political debate and far less reason to buy a newspaper
7294374 people no longer identify themselves as trade unionists or working class or middle class they just want to know where theyre going to get their next car from
7294375 and maybe theres something else to do with the narrowing of education which is all to do with schooling to get work rather than to understand the world
7294376 on the whole though i dont think the problems in the media are being driven by cultural changes in readers they are being driven by internal logic of corporations

7294448 its just not his personality that doesnt mean he wouldnt be a good congressman

7294523 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well

7294653 mir w re es am liebsten dass ein solches camp gar nicht mehr stattfindet die polizeieins tze der vergangenen tage haben gezeigt dass innenbeh rde und polizei entschlossen kompromisslos gegen gewaltt ter vorgegangen sind auch in zukunft werden wir f r recht und ordnung sorgen und es wird f r straft ter kein pardon in hamburg geben

7294657 the other boys really kept me on my toes in that session i had put a decent lap time in but thought that i was still second so i just went out there and was riding on the limit
7294658 i just tried a little bit harder on the final attempt and tried something different going in to the chicane it didnt work and i ended up on the floor
7294659 it was a pretty good qualifying session and i have to be happy the new qualifying format certainly makes it all action and we didnt have much of break to think it was a case of get out on track and give it your all
7294660 it was key to be on the front row for these races and if i can make a good start we should get another good result it would be fantastic to get another win here

7294755 the pakistan cricket board have been extremely reasonable about the whole subject and they worked jolly hard to try to give comfort to the member boards of the teams touring that the place would be safe and secure
7294756 unfortunately five of the participating nations found it impossible to send their teams to pakistan because of safety and security concerns
7294757 all the players i know personally from other countries have expressed their concerns in terms of safety and security it was good that this decision was taken out of our players hands

7294771 whats the point in savin the world if you cant get a little nookie once in a while huh
7294772 i dont think any one can prepare for this role
7294773 its a lot of long hours seven days a week but you know what youre so busy you dont realize how crazy it is and its just getting crazier so
7294774 everyone said look were going to do this we think it is the right thing to open up this convention to the people of colorado and to the people of the country and to give them the opportunity to participate
7294775 people were a little overwhelmed at first but i think as we evolved as a team together and started planning this out we definitely realized that we could pull this off
7294776 it was fun watching teammates getting tossed into the river especially after they bragged how great they would be
7294777 most people throw very very sharp elbows to get a seat at the table and thats not matts style
7294778 hes quiet so people underestimate him underestimating him could be the biggest mistake that people can make
7294779 one of the things is having been on the obama staff during the primaries doing politics he knows who needs what who needs to be stroked more who needs little extra care there
7294780 he knows that all delegates are equal but some delegates are more equal than others
7294781 you cant plan for every option or any problem that might come up
7294782 but we have a really crack team a very talented team with years of convention experience theyve left no detail unturned
7294783 im not going to get into details of those conversations

7294787 ich bin mit dem ergebnis zufrieden platz 10 ist mein bestes ergebnis seit australien und besonders ab dem zweiten stint f hlte ich mich im auto wohler
7294788 sebastien fuhr ein gutes rennen und hat das gesamte wochenende eine gute leistung gezeigt
7294789 ich konnte ein starkes rennen fahren ohne zu viel angreifen zu m ssen ich habe hart gepusht wenn ich es musste habe aber gleichzeitig st ndig darauf geachtet dass ich auf meine reifen und die bremsen aufpasste
7294790 da ist es mir schon ziemlich schlecht gegangen und das ganze rennen war ziemlich schwierig das einzige was ich machen konnte war so hart zu pushen wie es nur ging um konzentriert zu bleiben
7294791 es h tte ber eine stunde gedauert es zu reparieren
7294792 die erste runde war hart weil ich inmitten einer gruppe war und dabei einige positionen verlor
7294793 es ist schade dass wir nicht in die top10 gekommen sind aber ich hoffe auf ein besseres rennen in spa
7294794 never borrow from the future if you worry about what may happen tomorrow and it doesnt happen you have worried in vain even if it does happen you have to worry twice
7294795 there you go see you have committed a crime and if your husband had performed oral sex on you cunnilingus both of you have contravened the malaysian penal code and if convicted of this crime you are both liable to be imprisoned up to 20 years in addition to being whipped as well
7294796 are you nuts what in the world are you harping about
7294797 our malaysian penal code makes it a crime to perform oral or anal sex regardless of gender or consent as long as the penis is inside the anus or mouth it is considered a crime
7294798 holy molly these are such common and natural acts that the whole world is doing them if this is a crime then everyone is guilty everyone is a criminal
7294799 ah but under malaysian criminal laws these are considered unnatural acts carnal intercourse against the order of nature
7294800 whoever who created this law is a moron perhaps someone who indulges in straight sex only via missionary position perhaps someone who hails from a very conservative background i pity him because he would never know the joy and ecstasy of having a blow job done on him and he would never know how to satisfy his partner by giving her oral sex or maybe he doesnt care at all
7294801 anyway who is going to enforce this archaic law which is as yesterday as victorian chastity belts will there be a moral squad similar to the very active and occasionally bungling khalwat squad
7294802 members of the moral or sodomy squad must be trained to recognize a real and pseudo or imagined penis with a proliferation of dildoes around one could easily get mistaken about the object that enters the anus or mouth they should carry with them tools of their trade like tape measures cameras x ray binoculars and storage containers specially for semen specimens they also must be prepared to work graveyard hours as most sodomy activities are presumed to take place at night
7294803 and if time and budget allow they should also be trained to take dna samples this way their evidence will hopefully be able to stand in court i mean all their efforts would be wasted if it cannot stand in court right why prosecute under the sodomy provisions at all if their evidences are not strong enough when challenged in court
7294804 since the law is about justice i am sure the authorities do not want to be seen to victimize only some sodomites
7294805 and while they are at it they should recruit more executioners for malaysian prisons due to the spike in the number of prisoners requiring to be whipped build more prisons as well because more than half of the malaysian population are expected to be incarcerated for offences under
7294806 install hidden cameras in prostitution dens or hotel rooms as well
7294807 malaysian image took a severe beating when a former deputy prime minister was charged for sodomy and when a serving dpm was implicated in a murder involving a mongolian beauty it seems that in both cases sodomy allegedly took place therefore drastic measures are needed to show to the world that malaysians are not a nation full of sodomites
7294808 today it is clear that if the sexual revolution has occurred anywhere it is in the practice and acceptance of oral sex among people under age twenty five it is virtually a universal part of the sexual relationship
7294809 incredible a perfect day it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track my start was not so good on the dirty side and going into turn 1 i was right on the limit and very close to kimi and could defend my position against jarno for the first stint but he had a bit more fuel on board and stayed out an extra lap and he overtook me in the pits but we can be very very happy with this result we made no mistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance the whole team can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races we can be in the top ten again
7294810 that was a very nice race apart from the fact that i touched with heidfeld which broke my wing which was a real shame as i had to do 17 laps like that losing around 20 seconds to the group i was in the next two stints were good quality and i had a good pace but i am happy with the result and i think we had the right strategy its my best result since australia and especially from the second stint onwards i felt much more comfortable and confident with the car and felt i could push as the track rubbered in as for the next races i continue to tackle them one at a time and hope that next time out in spa i can make it into the points
7294811 i cant complain with second place today this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so id describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us
7294812 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi before the first corner however im not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction as a result i could close the gap to robert kubica a little at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer having said that its good that the team scored a lot of points with lewiss second place and my fourth place
7294813 we saw another extremely solid vodafone mclaren mercedes team performance today the result of which was a very useful clutch of championship points but in truth we lost the chance of outright victory yesterday in qualifying in my view its pretty clear that if lewis had qualified with the same level of fuel as felipe hed probably have been able to control the race from the front but the nature of the circuit dictated that it was always going to be difficult for him to overtake today and that being the case we opted fairly early on to take the championship strategic option of settling for second place following on from his victory in hungary heikki also drove very strongly and helped bolster our points total in the constructors championship he responded well to the pressure applied by kimi and thoroughly deserved his fourth place

7294842 the story picks up after the girls first year of college they have matured their concerns and relationships are more complicated we can see how their friendship has changed as they themselves are changing
7294843 its a classic coming of age story but these are modern 21st century young women
7294844 one of the things i like about the story is how authentic it is and age appropriate its a time of fun and freedom and trying new things but also a time when we all begin to deal seriously with relationships self discovery and confidence there are often no easy answers to the fundamental questions about who we are and what we want
7294845 our goal was to satisfy the fans of the original movie and the books and at the same time create a self contained saga for an audience that may not have seen the sisterhood of the traveling pants or know the books that really is the job of a sequel i knew we had a tough act to follow but i also knew that these characters had been so well developed and presented with such honesty that it was clear to see they had a future
7294846 after the first movie i believe we felt that these characters deserved to live on and as filmmakers we approached the sequel with as much anticipation as fans we wanted to see what these women were going to do next

7294853 to put yourself through what is a pretty rigorous process of running for president youve got to have learned to set up some pretty high expectations for got to be driving you and in my case if you have somebody that is absent maybe you feel like youve got something to prove when youre young and that pattern sets itself up over time
7294854 the stories i heard about my father painted him as larger than life which also meant that i felt i had something to live up to you could argue that if youre too well adjusted you dont end up running for president so if the pattern sets in pretty early on where youre pushing your comfort level it probably has to do with those very early influences and that can come from either the absence or the presence of a father who ends up motivating you in some way
7294855 without a father he was forced to arm himself and to make his own way into the worlds he chose to join and to master
7294856 obama was left with two alternatives either descend into chaos as a lost soul or steel himself against the world in order to rise in it he chose steeliness over surrender
7294857 is thus one of survival and defense for of all the advice he was ever offered the most significant and the one perhaps most relevant to his rise and to his fate was his stepfather lolo soetoros always protect yourself
7294858 the nice thing about it is that at least people tend to underestimate me
7294859 i think my strength actually comes in my case from the absence of a father at some level i had to raise myself my mother obviously was the dominant influence in my life and i had a stepfather and a grandfather who both participated in raising me and were good men who did good things for me but if i think about how i have been able to navigate some pretty tricky situations in my life it has to do with the fact that i had to learn to trust my own judgment i had to learn to fight for what i wanted
7294860 but because many americans think obama is not what he actually is it has become that
7294861 that is a potential problem particularly in a race that shows ever more signs of being extremely close
7294862 at some point these are issues thoughtful people will need to face head on rather than cede the ground to propagandists who traffic in intolerance and who deprived of the ability to make racial slurs with impunity simply shift their focus to religion
7294863 many have discoursed on what an obama victory could mean for america we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives
7294864 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to in this event the worlds judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race
7294865 the attraction of barack obama as a candidate has less to do with the cut of his suits or the fact that hes championed by hip rock singers than with an almost geeky earnestness a decency and sobriety that he projects when speaking to a crowd
7294866 a large part of his mystique lies in his insistence on his message and on the complexity of that message and in his old fashioned almost stern will to cut the flim flam and in a way so retro its almost novel to actually address the issues
7294867 but will obama amid the pulsating theatrics also attempt the less glamorous and more difficult task of explaining specifically where he wants to move the country and how he proposes to move it above and beyond reciting his policy positions
7294868 history as well as recent public opinion polls suggests that he badly needs to do so
7294869 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7294870 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7294871 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7294872 theres a huge complementarity between the feds lender of last resort function and the intimate knowledge of financial institutions
7294873 the macroprudential supervisor would recognize that for the system as a whole excessively conservative lending policies could prove counterproductive if they contribute to a weaker economic and credit environment
7294874 in principle such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered and because activities or risk taking not permitted to regulated institutions have a way of migrating to other financial firms or markets
7294875 if part of this plan fuels inflation a way must be found to prevent this or control any negative aspects
7294876 blocking dangerous trends of western intoxication and secularism which were infiltrating the countrys administration

7294883 his mouth has gotten him into trouble sometimes it did that night with me but hes a very passionate man who is intelligent about the issues in this country
7294884 i think perhaps under stressful situations at times all of us may embellish a little bit and may not handle it 100 percent the way we should
7294885 i feel sorry that this particular thing that i was involved in affected him as adversely as it did
7294886 i owe you a big apology its 20 years too late
7294887 i came out of there that night shaking my head

7294909 more individual u s athletes will carry home gold medals around their neck than any other nation if you want to count it that way
7294910 whats good for us as a country is overall participation
7294911 were fascinated like any other country by gold medals but that is more important in a way is that our team sports do very well
7294912 thats what gets the kids out of the chairs and away from the computers and the obesity problems in our country and other countries so they can play everybody can play on a team
7294913 in athens in 2004 our team sports took a hit
7294914 we knew it would be difficult here but we continued to invest we will not abandon these sports in an effort to earn medals in individual sports that sometimes might be less expensive
7294915 the citizens of the united states of america and even the rest of the world can be proud of the participation of the united states and our team here
7294916 people stepped up and did better than they had tracked but we always said that china would be strong and you always get a medals bump as the host country when things shook out it really did track with what we saw coming in
7294917 we have to go back now and see if there is a way to bring these finishes up and turn them into gold medals
7294918 that will keep me in a job for the next four years
7294919 were gong to have to redouble our effort in future games
7294920 team sports will continue to be an important part of our culture even though its far cheaper to train one athlete for an individual sport than 18 to 30 for a team sport
7294921 the key for us is to find a way to stay competitive in multi medal sports without destroying the integrity of our team sports
7294922 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7294923 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7294924 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7294925 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable

7294931 the united states invaded iraq based on false premises the administration orchestrated a public relations drive to prove that iraq had weapons of mass destruction and connections to the 9 11 terrorists both proved false
7294932 whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors united states intelligence agencies and iraqi defectors led to the discovery that iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large scale biological weapons program and that iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated
7294933 to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability
7294934 beginning in may 2004 isg recovered a series of chemical weapons from coalition military units and other sources a total of 53 munitions have been recovered
7294935 initially saddam chose to conceal his nuclear program in its entirety as he did with iraqs bw biological warfare program aggressive un inspections after desert storm forced saddam to admit the existence of the program and destroy or surrender components of the program in the wake of desert storm iraq took steps to conceal key elements of its program and preserve what it could of the professional capabilities of its nuclear scientific community
7294936 many locations associated with previous wmd programs and sites under monitoring by the united nations have been completely looted often there is nothing but a concrete slab at locations where once stood plants or laboratories
7294937 we cannot express a firm view on the possibility that wmd elements were relocated out of iraq prior to the war
7294938 isg technical experts fully evaluated less than one quarter of one percent of the over 10 000 weapons caches throughout iraq
7294939 saddam wanted to end sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction when sanctions were lifted
7294940 i think its a fantastic choice it really balanced the ticket
7294941 what it tells us is there was concern in the obama campaign probably reasonably about both his perceived experience and foreign policy credentials
7294942 hes basically said that barack obama is not qualified on that point joe biden and the republican party agree

7294951 olympic athletes dream of being part of the olympics every four years
7294952 right after the olympics are over our mindset is already focused on the next four years and what we can do to change how we prepare and try some new things and thats something im looking forward to now
7294953 i still have things that i want to do in the sport ive never competed over here in london and im looking forward to really experiencing more of the city and be able to prepare myself to hopefully swim some fast times
7294954 ive no idea what im really going to do but im looking forward to trying some new events and swimming some events that i havent really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7294955 ive never really swum the backstroke or the 100m freestyle at a major international competition so bob bowman my coach is going to throw everything he has ever done coaching me out of the door and try something completely different just to see how it works
7294956 no breaststroke no distance swimming no open water at least those guys will still be my friends
7294957 im excited for the next four years and today is the kick off for the next four years
7294958 we are just trying a bunch of new things and if its successful then great and if not then we can go back to what we were doing
7294959 but im looking forward to having some changes because the last 10 or 15 years have been the same thing the whole time
7294960 ive got some pretty lofty dreams in my head and those goals are going to stay there until they are accomplished
7294961 this has been one of the hardest things ive ever done to be able to swim 17 times and make sure that i have to be ready to swim at my beat in every one of those races because im competing against people who are focusing just on that one race
7294962 i know that its not going to be easy getting there and there are going to be some bumps in the road here and there but everybody has bumps in the road and it really just depends on how you get over those and make sure it doesnt happen again
7294963 i dont think its going to be perfect but its going to be fun over the next few years while i finish off my career
7294964 i told myself i would never compete past the age of 30
7294965 i started swimming when i was seven and i told my coach im not swimming past the age of 30 so dont get any ideas
7294966 he said thats good because i dont want to coach you past the age of 30

7294998 the case is not yet settled and to me it is absurd that with a disease that has a median survival rate of nine months companies can be given over a year to make a compensation offer
7294999 it is a horrific disease and no monetary figure could compensate for the deterioration in a persons health and their suffering
7295000 but at least if there was a quick resolution it would be an awful lot easier on the family without that to worry about

7295023 sua experi ncia pode acalmar aqueles que se preocupam com a pouca experi ncia de obama em assuntos mundiais
7295024 fortalece as credenciais da chapa democrata em pol tica externa e d a obama um candidato combativo quando se encaminha para a luta com o candidato republicano casa branca senador john mccain
7295025 em biden obama escolheu um senador conhecido por sua experi ncia em assuntos internacionais mas tamb m por sua destreza no combate pol tico
7295026 se obama pretende sanear a cultura pol tica de washington escolheu como seu escudeiro uma emin ncia parda n o um rosto novo
7295027 comparado com obama que freq entemente descrito como calmo e emotivo o senador joe biden direto e despreocupado
7295028 obama diz que representa um novo tipo de pol tica n o partid ria mas fez uma escolha conservadora de companheiro de chapa
7295029 biden em muitos sentidos o que obama n o tem experi ncia conhecedor de assuntos exteriores e cat lico
7295030 talvez e isto o mais importante n o seja temeroso com um hist rico de classe trabalhadora e estilo combativo biden poderia resistir s tentativas do partido republicano de qualificar obama de elitista
7295031 obama se exp s a duas cr ticas a de que est compensando sua pouca experi ncia como o presidente dos eua george w bush fez quando escolheu dick cheney e que a inclus o de biden enfraquece o argumento de obama segundo o qual a sabedoria mais importante do que a experi ncia
7295032 preciso dar cr dito a obama porque n o permitiu que estas obje es t ticas o impedissem de escolher um companheiro impressionante
7295033 deve se perguntar importante escolher algu m que me ajude a ganhar a elei o ou algu m que me traga benef cios se eu realmente ganhar
7295034 com sua escolha de joe biden obama sabiamente optou pelo ltimo
7295035 o fato de obama ter escolhido biden sugere que ele n o se intimida com os colaboradores e conselheiros fortes e conhecedores que possam questionar seu pensamento e que assumam tarefas importantes
7295036 obama escolheu o certo em vez do duvidoso e a experi ncia em lugar da mudan a
7295037 biden mostrou imediatamente que est pronto para assumir o papel tradicional de combatente agressivo e descreveu mccain como um homem muito rico que n o consegue entender os problemas do cidad o comum

7295059 deco once again with a bit of magic i think thats whats going to help us win the league this year
7295060 i dont think it was as good as last week against portsmouth
7295061 for us today it was just about stopping them and getting three points
7295062 they have a good squad and good organisation they are athletic and they have power
7295063 some people said that chelsea will win the league easily after last week because they want us to believe this so that we will relax and lose some points
7295064 hes an intelligent player a very good dribbler with good control of the ball hes smart
7295065 he is just a normal person although he may be from a different planet
7295066 we are competing for the tri nations its a seriously tough competition you only have to look at the games so far to see that
7295067 our mindset is to get up for the challenge next week if we can do that there might be an opportunity for us a couple of weeks after that
7295068 everyone can do the ramifications and what ifs but that wont come into play too much for us
7295069 chalk and cheese i feel very honoured to have been part of that era winning pretty much every trophy there was to win
7295070 at the moment we are a group that is starting on a journey that hopefully is very productive but its only a beginning for this group
7295071 if you ask that question in a year or two hopefully ill give you a positive answer
7295072 we have come over so many times and got so close but weve faced disappointment after disappointment
7295073 to finally get the monkey off our back is just great
7295074 that really emphasises where this group is at at the moment weve got so many young guys who havent got that baggage i think that helps all those guys whose first time it was on african soil i thought they did really well
7295075 belief was something that i mentioned before the game that always gets tested over here and again it came into play late in the game the positive mindset this team has and the belief is so far holding us in good stead
7295076 i lost my composure a little bit but that was because i was pretty dirty with myself for what i did a few minutes before which led to them scoring
7295077 it was a square up as far as i was concerned so i was pretty happy also in the context of the game it got us into a more comfortable position
7295078 we know this is a two match tour very happy with what we achieved today and rightly so but another challenge awaits us in seven days
7295079 we sent that report to the icc it would have been irresponsible of us as a board to send our youngsters to pakistan in the current situation
7295080 he wasnt listed in the starting team and also wasnt listed on the bench
7295081 i knew that he was warming up before the game so i just asked the referee and roar coach frank farina what was going on they told me he was having a test
7295082 i know that you can change at the very last minute but he wasnt listed as one of the subs
7295083 i was pretty pleased with the way we played both first half and second half
7295084 but as i said to the boys weve got to close those games out
7295085 if were serious about doing something this year those sorts of ones youve got to close them out when youve got them on the ropes like we had them
7295086 its just a matter of youve got to sort a fair bit of stuff out
7295087 im happy its out of the way a lot of stuff its nice all the focus is on the dragons now and i think it showed this weekend
7295088 they were a couple of little pretty things but i dont think they meant too much
7295089 i think our forwards were great and when you come up against that pack youve really got to aim up or it can be a hard day for the backs
7295090 i thought they were great and they probably deserve most of the credit
7295091 thats what helps you get in a position to win
7295092 they were great tackles even though gaz has tackled like a fullback this year he actually hasnt defended there and to size wade mckinnon up was a great effort
7295093 matty prior is a front rower and to get across where he got to again thats what helps you get into a position to do well in games
7295094 im probably the most un emotional bloke ever and then i saw mum and i couldnt really cuddle her because i was about to well up in tears
7295095 shes going to think i brushed her but i gave her the half cuddle and kept walking
7295096 the roosters are only two points ahead of us and weve got a better for and against so we can definitely go past them
7295097 it depends on us winning weve got to beat parramatta and then the roosters and we need a result to go our way
7295098 then they came out and said i was playing halfback i didnt get to touch the ball anyway it was probably a good thing
7295099 we think theres a number of players who are key players
7295100 at the start of the year we were picked to come last with our full squad
7295101 i guess there will be a little bit more pressure on me
7295102 the injury toll this year has been unbelievable but whoever we have put in has played awesome football

7295105 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger councils would step in to deal with an undernourished or neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents place children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right for a council to keep the childs health under review it is vital that councils primary care trusts and the nhs work with parents to ensure children dont end up dangerously overweight in the first place there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the childrens welfare is in jeopardy

7295125 it wasnt one of our best it wasnt one of our worst
7295126 it was just a quiet dull day i thought north melbourne were pretty good they turned up and played but we just seemed to have their measure for most of the day
7295127 i dont think some of our boys played today to the standard required but youve got look at the opposition and the opposition are first class
7295128 i thought he was outstanding hes actually playing at about 7 1 2 ft now when hes going for his marks
7295129 im pretty sure he wont kick eight goals the next time we play them
7295130 they have a good squad and good organisation they are athletic and they have power
7295131 hes a very good player but he is a player of real madrid
7295132 apart from the goal which was a wonder strike from deco after that they havent really done that much against us
7295133 you can see why deco has played at the highest level he has that little bit of extra quality
7295134 deco once again with a bit of magic i think thats whats going to help us win the league this year
7295135 i dont think it was as good as last week against

7295138 five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered except maybe towards the end a little bit on the clay
7295139 now it changes a little bit because obviously theres a shift in the rankings rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time so it will be interesting to see how he handles it
7295140 and maybe its nice for me to go into a grand slam for a change maybe not having no1 next to me
7295141 when you want to win the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same the goal is still continuing improve my tennis and continuing playing a very good tournament thats the only goal
7295142 be no1 sure very happy to be no1 its a big satisfaction for me after a long time being no2 but at the same time nothing changes no
7295143 never easy the first round of a tournament like this and playing against a qualifier who is coming with good rhythm
7295144 he won some matches before on the same surface so its going to be a tough match always and i have to try to start strong
7295145 ive won here the last four times i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a us open
7295146 rafa has never been beyond the fourth round or quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players that they dont have

7295153 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7295154 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7295155 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7295156 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7295174 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7295175 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7295176 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence

7295217 olympic athletes have to display an unnatural and it has to be said wholly unhealthy level of self discipline in the build up to big competitions how else is this going to manifest itself than with a volcanic release of pent up hedonism
7295218 a common sight to see recently knocked out athletes gorging on magnums and mcdonalds swilling alcohol and of course shagging like crazy
7295219 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions

7295258 like people to speak in this kind of thought speak where you talk for three minutes and dont say anything

7295260 slobodan milosevic is getting the living hell kicked out of him
7295261 my staff talks to me and sometimes im not in charge but all kidding aside
7295262 i find this the single most fascinating debate i have been involved in in 28 years i sincerely do it is not a joke i am not being facetious
7295263 in full disclosure i wrote that bill im not being facetious
7295264 no no im not being facetious im not being facetious when i say that
7295265 i introduced the terrorism bill in 94 that had a lot of these things in it
7295266 when i was chairman in 94 i introduced a major antiterrorism bill back then
7295267 i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing and the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill
7295268 the real threat comes to this country in the hold of a ship the belly of a plane or smuggled into a city in the middle of the night in a vial in a backpack
7295269 literally as recently as yesterday i spoke to the national press club and talked about the fact it is just as easy to fly from national airport into the white house as it is to you know do the same thing in new york

7295273 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7295274 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7295275 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
7295276 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together

7295280 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred during the operation by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province
7295281 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
7295282 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
7295283 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
7295284 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred
7295285 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up
7295286 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
7295287 we will have press credentials from 5280 and will be crashing all the parties and stalking all the famous celebrities here in town and interviewing them on camera
7295288 as the leader of the legendary party i believe we need to reach across the aisles and clubs and bars and have more fun

7295297 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think obamas made a very wise selection
7295298 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and a good man
7295299 bjp should strengthen us here like we did to them in bihar they are like our equal partners there so our demand of 15 20 seats in the capital is justified
7295300 we are concentrating on these constituencies as bjp cannot win these seats on its own due to various reasons
7295301 the singers will perform across delhi in the run up to the assembly elections they will inform people of delhi about the achievements and the good rule of the bsp government in uttar pradesh
7295302 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7295303 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7295304 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7295305 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7295306 always some else the next guy who will make your cold heart melt
7295307 theyre all the same they all want the money theyre all insane they live for fame honey they laugh at you when youre not even being funny
7295308 so ill wait til kingdom come all the highs and lows are gone a little bit longer and ill be fine
7295309 thanks to its own hard line policies and miscalculations and the determination of free people around the world beijing utterly failed to portray the happy picture of tibet it had planned for in the lead up to the olympics and during the games chinese authorities have espoused vitriol against the dalai lama and his supporters broken their pledges of media access and committed both petty and gross violations against internationally recognized human rights norms from blocking access to rock songs celebrating peace to shooting tibetan demonstrators dead
7295310 there is a real drama going on in tibet during these olympic games and it has little to do with the flying buddhist sprites of the opening ceremony or the operatically conveyed propaganda of the closing ceremony chinas leaders now should move beyond showmanship to statesmanship and engage the tibetan people in finding real solutions to the real problems in tibet
7295311 not only have the olympics failed to act as a catalyst for political liberalization in china but the regimes pre olympics security buildup looks set to enable the government to crack down as hard as ever on dissent after the games are over growing instability on various fronts has predisposed the hu leadership toward strengthening the police state apparatus that has been put together in the name of ensuring a trouble free olympics moreover cadres in the law and order establishment who include senior officials in the central political and legal commission as well as military police and judicial departments have gained immense clout not to mention much more funding since early this year
7295312 in one hotel which had no guests at the time about 20 soldiers took over upstairs rooms overlooking the street for the entire period they entered the hotel discreetly so few people knew they were there they were behind curtains or stood back from the window in some other way so as not to be visible from the street they were changed periodically by replacements they paid a small token fee for each room and were well behaved and friendly all were chinese my source believed that an order had been given for that 24 hour period that soldiers could shoot on sight anyone who was seen with a knife or other weapon
7295313 the source heard four or five gun shots while he was at home with family and friends he wanted to go out into the street to see what was going on but his family and friends advised against that because the situation was obviously dangerous and in addition strict restrictions had been imposed upon the movement of tibetans since a few days before the olympics began he along with his family and friends performed some prayers at home
7295314 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
7295315 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
7295316 all performers who are going to beijing must have the strongest consideration for political responsibility and must show the best ideological form in order for the performance to be lively and attractive
7295317 the performance must be symbolic of the great unity of ethnic groups in the tar and to represent the remarkable achievement of tibetan people under the excellent communist partys leaders and their policies
7295318 now you can say this is a perfect marriage between these two art forms just as the marriage of princess wencheng and king songtsen gampo was a marriage between the chinese and tibetan peoples
7295319 new city manager just struck it rich concords incoming city manager dan keen just hit the jackpot the terms and conditions of his new contract yet to be approved have just been released and boy are they nice
7295320 the city council wanted a commitment from tallen and keshen that the novato theater would be used for film and or performing arts tallen and keshen indicated they could not make that commitment
7295321 the north coast railroad authority is anticipating up to 60 railcars coming through novato and along highway 37 per day the ncra had not evaluated the impact noise vibration etc to the residents living working along the rail line nor committed to mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate those impacts
7295322 there can be no more excuses or reasons why this fight cannot happen
7295323 according to the organisations that matter i am as deserving of a title shot as any other heavyweight out there i knew that already but now its down there in writing
7295324 i have two top five rankings as a heavyweight and have only boxed 105 seconds as a heavyweight what does that tell you about the state of the heavyweight division what does it say about the organisations confidence in me dethroning klitschko they think im ready
7295325 klitschko should choose to fight me above the rest for a number of reasons
7295326 firstly a fight between us two is the only heavyweight fight that can bring excitement to the division
7295327 secondly unlike some other recent klitschko challengers i bring three key ingredients to the table ambition punch power and a six pack

7295354 us and european pre eminence in science based innovation cannot be taken for granted the centre of gravity for innovation is starting to shift from west to east
7295355 results and the knowledge generated through research should be freely accessible to all
7295356 shopping and walking on the street does not count as a performance
7295357 he who wisheth to apply himself unto so great and so difficult a science should have his mind free from all business and from all extraneous ideas of whatever nature they may be
7295358 the which matters being prepared it is necessary for thee to search out and arrange some fitting place wherein the magical art and its experiments can be put in practice
7295359 it will be necessary for thee to wait for the hour in which thou shouldest commence the operation but when once it shall be commenced at this hour thou shalt be able to continue it unto the end seeing that it deriveth its force and virtue from its beginning which extendeth to and spreadeth over the succeeding hours so that the master of the art will be enabled to complete his work so as to arrive at the desired result
7295360 when the master of the art wisheth to put in practice any operation or experiment especially one of importance he should first consider of what companions he should avail himself this is the reason why in every operation whose experience should be carried out in the circle
7295361 but if it be absolutely necessary for him to have companions these companions should be obligated and bound by oath to do all that the master shall order and prescribe them and they should study observe and carefully retain and be attentive unto allwhich they shall hear for those who shall act otherwise shall suffer and endure many pains and labors and run into many dangers which the spirits will cause and procure for them
7295362 but for the safety both of soul and of body the master and the companions should have the pentacles before their breasts consecrated and covered with a silken veil and perfumed with the proper fumigations by the which being assured and encouraged they may enter into the matter without fear or terror and they shall be exempt and free from all perils and dangers provided that they obey the commands of the master and do all that he ordain them if they shall act thus all things shall go according unto their desires
7295363 all being thus arranged the master should take heed that his disciples are perfectly instructed in those things which they have to perform
7295364 these companions or disciples should be three in number without including the master they may also be of the number of five of seven or of nine but so that they ever implicitly obey the orders of their master for thus only shall all things come to a successful issue
7295365 when they shall have arrived at the place and all things being disposed in their proper order the master shall take the knife or other convenient consecrated magical implement of steel wherewith to form the circle of art which he intends to construct this being done he must perfume it and sprinkle it with water
7295366 having entered into the circle to perform the experiment he should sound this trumpet towards the four quarters of the universe first towards the east then towards the south then towards the west and lastly towards the north
7295367 in order to properly carry out the greatest and most important operations of the art various instruments are necessary as a knife with a white hilt another with a black hilt a short lance wherewith to trace circles characters and other things
7295368 having chosen a place for preparing and constructing the circle and all things necessary being prepared for the perfection of the operations take thou the sickle or scimitar of art and stick it into the center of the place where the circle is to be made then take a cord of nine feet in length fasten one end thereof unto the sickle and with the other end trace out the circumference of the circle which may be marked either with the sword or with the knife with the black hilt then within the circle mark out four regions namely towards the east west south and north wherein place symbols and beyond the limits of this circle describe with the consecrated knife or sword another circle but leaving an open space therein towards the north whereby thou mayest enter and depart beyond the circle of art
7295369 make a small book containing the prayers for all the operations the names of the angels in the form of litanies their seals and characters the which being done thou shalt consecrate the same unto god and unto the pure spirits in the manner following
7295370 thou shalt set in the destined place a small table covered with a white cloth whereon thou shalt lay the book opened at the great pentacle which should be drawn on the first leaf of the said book and having kindled a lamp which should be suspended above the center of the table

7295377 we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky
7295378 when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public
7295379 interesting note that several wwe wrestlers are attending the upcoming democratic and republican national conventions
7295380 im not sure whos going where but i do know that batista and president bill clinton would have a helluva time together considering they are both socially inclined we dont do many politics on this site but i will tell you that i havent decided who i am going to vote for come november professional politicians who cant even balance our countrys check book and who govern only to be reelected and not to better our country have used up all their passes with me
7295381 really nice old school match on friday night smackdown between finlay and shelton benjamin both men wrestled aggressively and in a bad mood i loved the physicality it seems as if benjamin is starting to come into his own amazing athletic gifts like sheltons should be taken advantage of by the bearer i like what i have been seeing lately from the amateur standout from the university of minnesota
7295382 what if every wrestler in any training program or wrestling school were given dvds of a specific wrestler who the students resembled wanted to emulate or performed like in the ring
7295383 we ended up making it to the pay per view just late and they suspended us because of that
7295384 i would say yes as long as it never gets in the way of the show it would be great to see it at the cinema its been there before so it would be good to see it again a movie is 90 minutes thats not that different from making a single episode so im not against it
7295385 the best news ive heard for a long time is that john mayer is single i wouldnt have given him a second glance but all that changed when i saw him perform live on tv recently with his top off i had to be calmed down so i am putting it out there john mayer i am going to hunt you down
7295386 ms bynes was driving a bmw when she made an unsafe turn and another car hit her
7295387 it was determined that she was at fault but no crime was committed
7295388 drugs and alcohol were not involved it was just a typical car accident there was no serious damage to either vehicle
7295389 everyone here was in a state of shock when the news came through i saw an assistant of helenas who told me she is absolutely stricken with grief she cant believe what happened
7295390 hey chris im shooting for pitchfork and they told me you were offering a 1 but there isnt one in my envelope
7295391 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7295392 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7295393 aware of allegations that the engagement in the shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian casualties
7295394 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7295395 expressed his condolences to the people affected in the airstrike
7295396 all efforts of the afghan government to avoid civilian casualties have not yielded any positive results and our innocent countrymen are still killed in anti terrorism operations
7295397 oil prices have been correcting but the peso has been depreciating there is some concern on that and the market will still react to that
7295398 you can pick up cheap stocks or if youre accumulating go for blue chips because investors outlook is short term due to political and economic uncertainties at the slightest uptick investors lock in on profits
7295399 i remember the protests the police dogs and the fire hoses i remember those who died in the fight to register black people to vote i remember the church burnings and now we could have a black president of the united states im not just happy im thrilled im ecstatic
7295400 they thought we were no better than animals and kept us in the pens for horses and cows
7295401 race is the elephant in the living room here in america nobody wants to talk about it but its a factor
7295402 racism is not as overt and obvious as it once was we keep hearing that america wants a change but does it want change enough to vote for a black man well learn that on election day if he wins i will die a happy man
7295403 im afraid that if he wins he will go back to his muslim upbringing and change the country to reflect that
7295404 he says hes become a christian but im not sure his muslim past and this talk about change worry me hes got a lot of support among african americans but my friends are christian church going people like me and they all feel the same way
7295405 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
7295406 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
7295407 are current polls accurate i dont know this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
7295408 i wouldnt want to be obama and up two points going into election day my guess is that the obama campaign understands that and they know its not enough to be ahead they have to be ahead by a lot
7295409 our goal is to radicalise america so we can achieve a new revolution
7295410 this country is facing the greatest conflagration in its history im talking about an obama victory about the flag of new africa replacing the stars and stripes about the extinguishing of america and the american way of life
7295411 an obama victory will revolutionise and energise the american people like never before i think obama is going to win and i think we will benefit from the backlash against that victory
7295412 people lost their lives so we could enjoy the right to vote so dont insult me by telling me youre not registered to vote its the least we owe ourselves
7295413 ooo look at me im making people happy im the magical man from happyland in a gumdrop house on lollypop laaaaaaane

7295416 ive never seen an england team worst set up they were a complete shambles ive never seen an england team so easy to counter attack it was a total mess
7295417 the problem with capello is that he doesnt understand english footballing culture and i think this was the biggest problem with sven goran eriksson
7295418 i think it was madness to get rid of mcclaren
7295419 with mcclaren there were some much better performances when they were winning all the home games 3 0 im not saying mcclaren is the best manager of all time all im saying is that he beat guus hiddink 4 2 on aggregate
7295420 capello has now had five friendlies and he has messed every one up england are now in a worst position than they were when capello came in
7295421 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7295422 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7295423 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7295424 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7295425 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7295426 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7295427 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy than 98 percent of us
7295428 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7295429 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7295430 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7295431 they havent called but if they need me im on a plane whatever they want

7295456 das ist die einzige politische meinung mit der biden recht hat

7295458 picked somebody who has unparalleled expertise on foreign policy somebody who will help him rebuild the economy put people back to work make our country independent of energy
7295459 were comfortable with our pick we had a lot of great choices and we talked to a lot of different people but i think we settled on a great pick and a great partnership to bring about change in this country
7295460 we captured excellent video of the two idiots who practically posed for the cameras as they were leaving
7295461 we wont let these terrorists get the upper hand please continue to patronize nomad and other neighborhood businesses at night we want to support our community by keeping the place open at night and getting more neighbors and more eyes out on the streets in the evenings
7295462 when we got to san francisco i was totally surprised by the misconceptions that people had about wikimedia
7295463 its a charity nobody is making any money from the organization nobody has made any money and nobody will ever get rich from it because were never going to sell it were not open for business were not looking for investment
7295464 i remember saying in november before coming to san francisco that we were as unsophisticated as possible
7295465 now we are competent we have a basic idea of what we are doing and a team coming together to get things done
7295466 sue gardner has really been key in professionalizing the wikimedia foundation
7295467 before sue we operated as a community club now we operate as a community club with sound management
7295468 everybody is grappling with what to do about the decline in the newspaper industry
7295469 when i was in the conventional media we all spent a lot of time wondering what we were doing wrong i dont see it that way at all theres amazing journalism going on at newspapers and at npr to me its a market shakeout or a market correction
7295470 we dont yet know a reason for the decline but we suspect it is due not to the wisdom of crowds but to the increased level of conflict among community members often it is not the one with the right answer who has their say but the one who sticks around the longest and is best able to argue his case
7295471 i dont see any competition direct or indirect that will significantly change wikipedia
7295472 i think our next challenge is figuring out how to really support and facilitate their work
7295473 the bills are getting paid the servers are running theres stationery people have business cards this is a really new model something the world has never seen it deserves new approaches
7295474 i tried to hop the fence and i got caught
7295475 its like fort knox you jump one fence and theres two more to jump theyve got guards theyve got cops theyve got people on horses there arent any infiltration points
7295476 somebody offered me 100 to look the other way and let him go over the fence
7295477 i wouldnt do it its not worth it theres only one way to do a job and thats the right way
7295478 these tickets are out of my price range way out of my range
7295479 and this is about the only free thing you can do at the festival
7295480 the streets were a mess the music is too loud and the park is fenced off golden gate park is a park not a concert stadium the city is supposed to be the guardians of the park not the broker for it
7295481 ive lived here for over 20 years and these are the worst folks in golden gate park ever screaming in the streets afterwards throwing shopping carts down the street running stop signs and there is absolutely no security to be seen hopefully this event will never be allowed again
7295482 this thing was dangerous with people pushing through a narrow 20 foot gap anxious to get to the next band in time people were desperate for bathrooms they were running past the guards through the woods just trying to find a place to pee
7295483 the park is trashed garbage everywhere not sure how they got a permit for the music to be so loud i love radiohead but that was ridiculous i think the neighborhood has had enough of these mega events leave no trace my a
7295484 its not staying here at bay meadows whos taking it home
7295485 there is nowhere in the world youre going to get another one
7295486 i wanted to come away today with a piece of history
7295487 itll go in the backyard just a bit of memorabilia
7295488 im too young to have been here in its heyday
7295489 it was sad to come here and see 300 people
7295490 youll have locals and racing fans who want the memorabilia youll have restaurants that can use the equipment then youll have the looky loos the people who are just curious thats ok we try to market to everyone
7295491 its not the last place a person might own but a great place to spend three to five years as a young single to build equity and move up
7295492 youre in a small space with great amenities and the resources of the city
7295493 what its doing is providing middle income housing without a subsidy
7295494 i know there was some gang affiliation between the victim and the suspect
7295495 like most architectural firms sheiner day kunz associates uses a generic name on blueprints when working for a well known client
7295496 gabor lorant head of the phoenix area chapter of the american institute of architects
7295497 said that in his 29 years of work here he had never heard of a blueprint practice such as the one mccain described as common practice

7295499 but im not worried about matts confidence because i think this competition being pushed by kurt has made him mentally tougher
7295500 this man deserves to be honored he has made us happy
7295501 it shows you this region has another face and has things to celebrate
7295502 it is a source of pride for us not for us alone but for all sudanese people
7295503 i cant find words to express my joy this is an achievement for my country first and then for me
7295504 i was able to achieve this honor because of a lot of hard training
7295505 one of the things i was very pleased with us last year is that we finished games
7295506 we finished the season extremely well and we have to continue to do that
7295507 hopefully this year we can start off a lot stronger and a lot faster than weve done as far as the season goes and also at the beginning of games
7295508 if we do have the intangible qualities as our team had last year with the talent we have then we have a chance at some point to be a good football team during the course of this season
7295509 i definitely believe we can play with teams like auburn and alabama last year we played well against tennessee and south carolina but felt like we let those games get away from us late we believe we can be better and win those games this year
7295510 we won eight games and went to the liberty bowl but we want to go out and prove we are even better this year
7295511 weve got more national championships we got more players in the pros so our talent level in this conference is the best in the country
7295512 the quality of our coaches is the best in the country if youre going to compete in this conference youve got to prepare well and youve got to play well every week
7295513 its really great croom cares about us as a man and a person both on and off the field
7295514 we take it as a great opportunity to play for the first black head coach in the sec what hes doing now is opening doors for a lot of people
7295515 thats what is great about coach croom he doesnt sugar coat things
7295516 hell tell you when you need to be working harder and in which areas you need to improve
7295517 we had a good spring and if we have good two a days we can look forward to a good opener against louisiana tech
7295518 hopefully well get off to a good start and keep it rolling but we have to focus on each game without looking ahead
7295519 i wasnt mad but i just said id like to get a score
7295520 i think im fitting in better today and i think that next week ill feel the same way
7295521 i think the guys in that room would say theyre getting a better feel for me and how i play i felt more at ease in the huddle i felt more at ease on the field
7295522 but it looks like hes getting more and more comfortable each and every day and every game
7295523 ill present my side ill say that id love to play one series two series
7295524 he may say that its not worth it and so be it
7295525 that was probably just me staying in mike mccarthys ear
7295526 i say heck if im going to practice i want to play at least a series
7295527 we had two long passes that i thought were really good plays they were set up nicely its just frustrating when you have those types of plays called back itll kill you
7295528 you can run all the laps you want but when the live bullets start flying you just have to do your thing
7295529 i would prefer not to be hit but thats ok
7295530 to sit here and say as the season gets under way that i wont get hit thats crazy i think our line is very good but most of the teams well be playing against are good
7295531 but i was able to use my feet to bail myself out a little bit
7295532 this man deserves to be honored he has made us happy
7295533 it shows you this region has another face and has things to celebrate
7295534 it is a source of pride for us not for us alone but for all sudanese people
7295535 i cant find words to express my joy this is an achievement for my country first and then for me
7295536 i was able to achieve this honor because of a lot of hard training
7295537 this year weve made a conscious effort to balance the introduction sessions with deep dives
7295538 it provides customers with the best of both worlds they get their local trusted advisor and local people but by being part of a national organisation theres a lot bigger skill base and resources we can bring to bear on projects
7295539 our strategy is around the quality of people and their technical capability weve done a bit of work with them and theres a high degree of mutual respect

7295541 epson had been heavily involved in the pc industry they had lost a lot of money and had divested out of it
7295542 this wonderful new product called the colour inkjet came through our technology was supreme and we went through rapid growth
7295543 we went from being a loss making company to being a significant profit maker we have been profitable ever since
7295544 my first years were spent evolving epson a lot of the industry was small resellers there were a lot of mum and pop shops noel leeming and dick smith were starting to come through and they were trying to add pcs and peripherals to their products i had experience at sanyo putting our facsimiles into mainstream retail
7295545 about 18 months ago we went to total individual cartridge machines which improved the price value of consumables to consumers and promoted that heavily we saw a very good lift in our sales it met what consumers wanted low cost individual cartridges
7295546 there has been a shift by consumers to buying genuine products thats because we have given them the price equation they were looking for you do pay a premium over a clone but weve pushed the advantages such as ink longevity and colour and light fastness
7295547 if you just want to take any old ink and put it into a plastic container it is cheap to do you can make silicon chips in the environment where were making ink cartridges
7295548 we are very niche with inkjet technology but we go a long way with that in the retail market epson has been very photo centric that has done us a lot of good but it has probably niche marketed us tighter than we would like to be
7295549 epson is starting to push its technology into the business arena we have been focussed on the consumer market that has been difficult because the price contraction and commoditisation has all happened at the consumer end
7295550 we are very strong in the lcd projector market epson is the number one lcd projector company by some margin and were a market leader here
7295551 the home entertainment projector market has been hit by the lower cost of lcd and plasma big screens and the downturn in the economy
7295552 the education market has provided a lot of growth for us lcd projectors have become high on the desired list for all schools
7295553 a big part of our income is from consumables ink and media if there is a recession it will still be affordable to print with epson
7295554 the business was always owned by epson australia so the managing director of epson australia was always on the board of epson new zealand it was the first time ever a local person was placed in the role
7295555 thats a very big thing these days i think this is a testament to the fact that it is a place where people want to work and want to stay that makes a successful company making sure the environment is a place people just want to be
7295556 we have a culture where you are not micro managed we have a lack of bureaucracy but not a lack of accountability
7295557 we have been involved with it for the past 10 years when we started new zealand was not in the world rankings now it is ranked in the top five
7295558 weve given lot of opportunities to a lot of kids through the club they learn the application of discipline reward respect and recognition i wish we could push it through to more kids because it really works
7295559 it is important and not a lot people do it i go to the gym six times a week they are not long sessions but i make sure i go

7295571 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think u s coach mike krzyzewski said
7295572 well its supposed to be nasty and salty and disgusting so why should i try it
7295573 given the sources we now have on the internet that information can almost always be easily found online speed and information go well together its poetry that primitive technology which is slow going and belongs in journals and books when we cant be there to hear it anyway
7295574 think that it is clear that we now can shape and defend an adequate conception of basic human equality apart from some religious foundation
7295575 a failure of argument on a very broad front indeed
7295576 claims that human relations must be conducted on the basis of an assumption that everyones life is equally important and that all members of a society have equal standing
7295577 light enough to lead them to the knowledge of their maker and the sight of their own duties
7295578 as a creature who knows about the existence of god and who is therefore in a position to answer responsibly to his commandments this is someone whose existence has a special significance
7295579 that every man acknowledge other for his equall by nature
7295580 as if master and servant were not introduced by consent of men but by difference of wit which is not only against reason but also against experience
7295581 nature hath made men so equall in the faculties of body and mind as that when all is reckoned together the difference between man and man is not so considerable as that one man can thereupon claim to himselfe any benefit to which another may not pretend as well as he
7295582 there are few so foolish that had not rather governe themselves than be governed by others nor when the wise in their own conceit contend by force with them who distrust their owne wisdome do they alwaies or often or almost any time get the victory
7295583 from this equality of ability ariseth equality of hope in the attaining of our ends therefore if any two men desire the same thing which they cannot both enjoy they become enemies
7295584 t he remedy to the problem of living in society is not derivd from nature but from artifice or more properly speaking nature provides a remedy in the judgement and understanding for what is irregular or incommodious in the affections
7295585 im not sure that this claim is true because it seems to me that there have been stable societies where one group of individuals has systematically oppressed another group of autonomous individuals
7295586 if we cant ground our basic moral principles by appeal to supernatural moral religious facts then arent we left with the conclusion that the principle of equality is baseless a pragmatic justification for basic equality wont satisfy us because we feel that basic human equality is absolute and not something you can just opt out of
7295587 if it is asked what justifies using this vocabulary i admit that there is no answer but why should we expect there to be if we cannot get others to connect their natural sentiments of fellow feeling to a moral notion of equality then there is no further debate to be had with them only conflict
7295588 definition properties of type p supervene on properties of type q iff a thing cannot change its p properties without changing its q properties
7295589 def properties of type p supervene on properties of type q iff a things p properties cannot change without a change in its q properties
7295590 however it has been persuasively argued in john mackies ethics and by many since
7295591 if it is asked what justifies using this vocabulary i admit that there is no answer
7295592 ok thats true but why do we need necessary and sufficient conditions for equality heres my naturalist story of equality which certainly doenst require god s
7295593 i know what you are saying but i think you can be bolder there is no rational justification but there is a perfectly good humean justification that goes something like cos thats the sort of society i want to live in and if you dont then i reckon there is something wrong with you and i dont want to share this society with you and that is all we need and as far as im concerned thats as good a justification as we need
7295594 if chris wants to see that as lacking something crucial he has to provide an argument that there is something more to our practise of moralising what am i missing
7295595 scientific data have proven that for attending low risk births that is births without complications midwives are not second class obstetricians but rather obstetricians are second class midwives
7295596 it is a natural visualization in nearly all cultures and may even resemble our very thought process when we think about or imagine something a window like object
7295597 should i be typing with a pen in my hand
7295598 brain and computer are bound in metaphor and in function they also appear to be coevolving into likeness of being interfaces and devices on each side are matching each other more closely for example the computers graphical resolution is approaching the humans optical resolution while humans most adept at typing quickly ensure their survival in the computer world
7295599 it would then seem to follow that the structures that are most likely to prosper in computing are the ones most compatible with existing structures in the brain
7295600 this would support the view that our neurons are arranged in conceptual clumps domains that can be laterally progressively or regressively linked and that a hyperlink is just one of many primitive forms of artificial synapse
7295601 whatever it was whether it was the marketing the product function or the product name no one can dismiss the popularity of microsofts windows
7295602 and maybe just maybe i shouldnt be drinking this seawater
7295603 theyre all out looking for renewable clean power and a way to lasso it
7295604 its exciting that people are interested because the more people who are interested the lower the prices are going to be because the greater the competition will be
7295605 we may have a starting gate that has 200 horses in it
7295606 i expect theres going to be a lot of bidders in this clean power call but still the b c utilities commission has to decide the demand and confirm b c hydros need and it also has to confirm all contracts b c hydro has to enter into
7295607 youve got the potential for wind projects in this province
7295608 youve got the potential for run of river hydro projects in this province maybe someones come in on the tidal side or there is the ocean side i dont know because right now its so early its hard to tell how big the starting gate is for the horse race
7295609 all new electricity generating projects are going have to have zero net greenhouse gas emissions
7295610 the reason for these calls is were committed to be electricity self sufficient by 2016
7295611 the dilemma with this field is there is a lot of hyperbole and a lot of dramatic positioning driven sometimes by very real ecological concerns sometimes by other factors
7295612 every builder has to pound the ground and cut the forest down to put a house in its place
7295613 we want him to follow through with what i think was a very good term from back in former prime minister john diefenbakers days roads to resources
7295614 the corridor down the mackenzie valley opens up communities as well as economic opportunities as well as securing northern sovereignty in our area
7295615 i will only be happy if they get substantial convictions
7295616 it will always be somewhere in the back of his mind and im sure it takes part in some of his dreams
7295617 it was a terrible thing to happen that should never have happened
7295618 if we call our case we lose that last kick at the cat opportunity as well
7295619 by not calling evidence the crown has to draw all the strings together and try and come up with a common thread and then we have an opportunity to hear the entirety of that argument before we make ours
7295620 in general theres a circumstantial body of evidence that the crown is going to rely on and suggest that it is sufficient to prove his involvement
7295621 obviously the man was kidnapped its a question of who did it or if you will what involvement they had
7295622 i might have something to say after the verdict but not now
7295623 our job is going to be to say when you look at the evidence carefully that actually isnt what occurred
7295624 basically the law on circumstantial evidence is such that if theres other reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence the judge is obliged to consider those
7295625 its all stuff that can be dealt with by way of argument because if there are other inferences that can be drawn he silverman is obliged to consider them
7295626 hes so experienced as a former criminal defence lawyer himself that he is capable of doing that
7295627 if it was a jury trial it would have been substantially different
7295628 for these guys that means getting up at five oclock in the morning getting shipped in
7295629 its a long long day for these guys because they have to come in so early and theyre stuck downtown they dont get back until close to suppertime
7295630 is the official slogan to promote the country it feels so right
7295631 i do think canada can get to the top 12 in 2012 but its going to take a big effort i do think there is a need for more investment
7295632 there were a number of events out there where we got a silver and i thought dammit just short of the gold
7295633 our ultimate objective at some time has to be how many gold medals will we win were certainly talking about that a lot more
7295634 we would appeal to prime minister stephen harper to give us the extra 6 million dollars wed asked for in the last budget
7295635 wed asked for 30 million lets look at the extra 50 or 60 million were going to need over the next few years to try and build the kinds of programs theyve got in britain and australia and the united states
7295636 if were going to play with the big boys if were going to be a g8 nation lets be g8 at all levels
7295637 its definitely hard to compete with the top countries especially when you look at diving trampoline and gymnastics
7295638 it was so difficult to compete against the chinese athletes here and the programs they have in place are just amazing
7295639 funding has to come early enough that theres time for the athletes to prepare and have access to everything they need and the support they need to compete with the top countries in the world were already seeing small improvements and hopefully its going to continue that way
7295640 we made a decision some time ago to start targeting the money and we realized we couldnt be a mile wide and an inch deep
7295641 australia targets the sports where they know they can get medals
7295642 im not sure we can ever be as targeted as that and i dont think canadians would accept that we have a certain egalitarian nature that is going to demand that every kid gets a chance but we can target more than we have in the past
7295643 the more you see of these tremendous young people the more you want to see of them but if you dont see them and you dont know who they are there isnt that passion to watch them
7295644 its tough enough in the ups and downs of the olympics world its another game in the ups and downs of the political world
7295645 athletes are training to perform in the sports world we would be very careful how they might be used in the political field
7295646 what i want to be when i grow up a hockey player
7295647 daddy went off on one of his disappearances and mother was ready to get a lawyer and divorce him when on that christmas eve before you were born in august here he came knocking on the back door like a tramp and i heard mother screaming at him telling him to go away but you know how persistent daddy is when he wants to be hardheaded like his father and mother mothers always saying and soon i peeked around the corner of the back hallway and there came daddy crawling on his knees like a penitent making the stations of the cross with his hands up in the prayer mode begging mother to let him come back home and mother caved daddy was so santa claus handsome that night so pleading next thing i know i was told to go to bed and leave them alone and i did but i stayed awake and listened to them arguing and daddy crying and mother cussing him out and reducing him to mincemeat and then it got quiet and next thing i heard was their old iron bed hitting the wall in a rhythmic way and then mother started moaning and well you were conceived on christmas eve and figure it up you were born nine months exactly later
7295648 where does the little brazz ohs river get its water
7295649 why do you say these questions could go on forever and a day daddy
7295650 why am i white daddy and isabel arispe is brown as a berry
7295651 isabel arispe is a mexican son thats why hes brown youre an american son thats why youre white
7295652 daddy you said i was white because the sun had bleached me
7295653 does that mean i was black like johnny shine i play with over at the darbys once
7295654 no son if you were ever black it was way back in ancient times
7295655 i can tell you the first person that obama sat down and talked to at all about this vice presidential issue was sen clinton they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with sen clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else in the last couple of months so thats simply not true
7295656 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7295657 obama has a high regard for sen clinton shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt that sen biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7295658 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7295659 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7295660 sen obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7295661 dont go with your strongest candidate and then go with a candidate that actually emphasizes all your weaknesses and has been quite vocal about them
7295662 i have not been as far as i can tell vetted if they do tell you about that
7295663 i am certain that the candidate its down to three or four candidates it is not me
7295664 it was a broad wide ranging conversation about whats going on in the country
7295665 i started to wonder whether the ad could be politically fatal for the organization
7295666 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7295667 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7295668 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7295669 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7295670 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things

7295688 i walked with her from work to catch the city bus that day and weve been together ever since on february 22nd they celebrated 16 years of marriage
7295689 not only are they new missions technically but there are also organizational and cultural differences among the adjutant general branch finance branch and logisticians so understanding adapting to and assimilating these new missions soldiers and units were the biggest challenge

7295778 one of the suspects had the knife police suspect was used in the murder
7295779 its good to see the offense and defense from a different perspective its actually pretty good it helped me a little bit
7295780 he used to be my apprentice i got him a locker right next to me i let him have my pads my coveted red pads i gave him everything i had because he was under my tutelage he left us he left all of us it was a secret coup behind my back its heartbreaking
7295781 indeed paredes was the most surprised about the switch but a move was needed because of injuries to running backs david farmer strained right knee and jake heun herniated disc whats more daniel libre did not practice because of a minor ailment the only healthy running back with game experience is leon wright jackson
7295782 hes tough rugged and he can run he played running back in high school he knows the offense hell be good because of that physical toughness and blocking ability
7295783 we still like him on defense too i think hes going to be a good team member
7295784 paredes who is 5 feet 11 and 235 pounds was a linebacker and receiver at castle high school but he also was used as a running back in certain situations
7295785 i saw him out there and i said whats going on but he did look good out there at running back
7295786 felt pretty natural i still have a lot of fundamentals and techniques to work on i have to get my footwork down
7295787 it looked worse on film but it was good news i hope to be back in a couple of weeks
7295788 left wideout greg salas and right wideout malcolm lane have won starting jobs but the development of nasca who moved from slotback to wideout a week ago and taylor a junior college transfer who was cleared to practice the past wednesday have created more options the speedy nasca a pearl city high graduate who transferred from azusa pacific last year has ascended to no 2 right wideout because nasca and taylor are still learning the position it was decided that pollard who was the no 2 right wideout through the first two weeks of training camp should move to left wideout
7295789 lee also said that when nasca and taylor become more proficient at right wideout then lane also could be used to spell salas at left wideout
7295790 so too can taylor who was recruited as a slotback
7295791 he has a lot to learn but his speed can help us
7295792 in schemes involving five defensive backs nickel 4 2 5 and okie 3 3 5 mouton becomes the nickelback often sneaking into the tackle box mouton has made several sacks off blitzes during team drills when mouton moves to nickelback roberts enters as the cornerback jeramy bryant a junior college transfer and jopierre davis also have been in the rotation but now chris black also a junior college transfer has entered the competition
7295793 i had to get all of that done before i could transfer out here everything is ok now
7295794 black who is 5 10 and 175 pounds has been competing at left cornerback yesterday he made two diving pass breakups and an interception
7295795 he had a big day i thought he did a heck of a job
7295796 in db drills i kind of sprained it a little bit but i got it taped up im ok it felt pretty good out there

7295800 footballs supposed to be fun its been a long camp and everybodys tired but you just try to keep it upbeat when were on the field its serious its about business
7295801 hes got the smarts hes got the instincts hes got the ability once in a while youll get a fast guy but he may be a little slower reacting because he doesnt understand the concepts as well or he doesnt react as quickly ryan is a smart fast guy he tackles well his technique is very good hes the most explosive person on the field
7295802 hes so talented hes got speed hes got great vert hes such a talented guy i dont really have to worry about him
7295803 you cant try to do too much just be in position to make a play knowing youre playing against the guys they have the burners and the nfl caliber guys that they are you have to be jacked up for those types of thing
7295804 i go home and im there for two or three days and the next thing you know im calling this guy
7295805 were laid back we like to make practice a little more fun so the new guys can see its not just a hard struggle game time its serious no jokes on the field
7295806 they come in bunches the last few days weve been really tightening things down reacting better to the quarterbacks seeing the ball thrown and actually making the play
7295807 its a big jump it was pretty intense its just the different type of drills catch you off guard
7295808 it could have been worse so it was good hopefully ill just rehab and im planning to be back in a few weeks

7295822 come in for a hike and then look at art or look at art and then go out for a hike

7295832 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7295833 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7295834 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7295835 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7295836 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7295837 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7295838 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7295839 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7295840 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7295841 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7295842 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7295843 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7295844 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7295845 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7295846 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7295848 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7295849 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7295850 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7295851 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7295852 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7295853 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7295854 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7295855 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7295856 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7295869 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7295870 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7295871 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7295872 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7295883 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7295884 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7295885 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7295886 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

7295894 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7295895 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7295896 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7295919 a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7295920 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and join me in making washington work for the american people i searched for a leader who understood the rising costs confronting working people and will always put their dreams first
7295921 today ive come back to springfield to tell you ive found that leader
7295922 president lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place and then stand firm
7295923 today in springfield i know my feet are in the right place and im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama

7295928 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7295929 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7295930 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7295931 this training camp here wasnt really that hard practice wasnt really that hard
7295932 at mount carmel they practice at a higher level than a lot of other places
7295933 mount carmel did prepare me for a lot of the things im going through here
7295934 the linemen are a lot bigger and stronger and youve really got to be a lot more physical than you were in high school
7295935 just because youve got guys running 4 3s 40 yard dash times 4 4s 4 5s youre not the only guy on the field running a 4 5 anymore
7295936 its definitely a big jump from high school to college
7295937 its definitely a big learning curve but so far i think its gone pretty smooth
7295938 youve got to come in here mentally ready to take in everything that theyre throwing at you im actually proud of myself for taking in things like i did thats been a big improvement on my part
7295939 actually i was kind of worried about it at first putting my hand on the ground at the next level
7295940 because im not so big as the other guys on the defensive line but im actually pretty glad that im playing that spot because it helps me to use the same defense
7295941 but ive actually been gaining a couple of pounds here and there so its coming up ive eaten a lot they feed us
7295942 coach ruben mendoza hes going to get me up there
7295943 but the injury has actually allowed me to learn the system better thats the only positive if there is a positive
7295944 im just trying to learn as much as i can about the defense and my position
7295945 theres so much to learn so many things to get used to
7295946 i have older guys in front of me that can teach me a lot
7295947 if i just sit back and learn from them and coach tenuta whos a great coach i can be successful
7295948 because in the summer theres not many people here were working out and taking classes but theres not many people on campus now that its camp we dont really have any social life so now that people are starting to come on campus i am excited for the student body to get here i think its going to be pretty fun
7295949 i dont know if anyone looks forward to starting classes
7295950 but its part of the college experience i am looking forward to it in a way because ill get to meet a lot more people im looking forward to getting to see some girls around here

7295971 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7295972 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest

7295974 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again

7295982 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7295983 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7295995 he asked if they could get a quick meal even though the kitchen was closed they wanted pasta and salad so the chef next door at serafina made it and brought it over

7295998 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7295999 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7296000 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7296001 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7296002 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7296003 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7296004 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7296005 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7296006 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7296007 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7296008 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7296009 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7296010 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7296011 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7296012 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7296013 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7296014 these are genuine documents nobody can challenge you just give me your photographs and choose a name in four weeks youll have a new identity
7296015 because bulgarias in the european community you have full rights in this country you can live here legally take advantage of the free nhs everything and no one can stop you travelling
7296016 he said its easy to find buyers especially on fridays at the main jumma prayers when the mosque is packed he then handed me a passport and asked me to deliver to a bangladeshi whos here illegally
7296017 i was so furious i came straight to the news of the world not only is it against our religion to commit fraud these documents could be used by extremists
7296018 i can help we can make as many passports as you want
7296019 these are 100 per cent genuine passports i know a bulgarian who has a connection in the home office over there thats how i get them i charge 2 500 but as you will want more i can do them for 2 000 a piece
7296020 am i ready to change the world of course i am
7296021 some people might call them the starbucks democrats versus the wal mart democrats
7296022 i think we can teach them how to talk to the rest of us
7296023 so far its been great meeting people talking to them discussing differences but i am concerned about the future
7296024 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7296025 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be okay
7296026 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7296027 you have to crack a few eggs in order to make an omlet
7296028 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7296029 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7296030 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7296031 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7296032 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7296033 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7296034 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7296035 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7296036 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7296037 as with all of my videos please feel free to forward share blog and get it out there youtube and
7296038 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7296039 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7296040 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7296041 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7296042 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7296043 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7296044 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7296045 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7296046 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7296047 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7296048 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7296049 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7296050 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7296051 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7296052 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7296053 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7296054 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7296055 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7296056 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7296057 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7296058 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7296059 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7296060 holy shit that damn dirty negro is defiling that white woman
7296061 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7296062 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7296063 hey du singst ich singe wollen wir mal zusammen singen
7296064 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7296065 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7296066 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7296067 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7296068 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7296069 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7296070 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7296071 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7296072 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7296073 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7296074 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7296075 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7296076 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7296077 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7296078 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7296079 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7296080 china won a total of 51 gold medals which proved chinas increasing national strength
7296081 as chinese living in a foreign country we were very proud of that
7296082 the olympic dream cherished by the chinese people over the past century now came true when china won 100 olympic medals at the beijing olympics
7296083 we were proud of our motherlands strength and wished the country more prosperous
7296084 we were very excited when knowing the chinese delegation was on the top of the gold medal list
7296085 although we are living and studying abroad we cheer for chinese athletes from our hearts
7296086 weve got a beach thats eroding thats being eaten away right now
7296087 it is affecting the way people are living what theyre used to
7296088 the north is never going to be a place that has a lot of resources
7296089 we want him to follow through with what i think was a very good term from back in former prime minister john diefenbakers days roads to resources
7296090 the corridor down the mackenzie valley opens up communities as well as economic opportunities as well as securing northern sovereignty in our area
7296091 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7296092 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

7296102 i think its amazing after such a bad result to come here to a new track and do a fantastic job
7296103 it was difficult to choose the right tyres particularly in qualifying and i think we did a perfect job on that
7296104 making the pole position winning the race and making and the fastest lap theres nothing more we can ask for especially after such a bad result
7296105 we still need to work very hard becasue today we had another problem with kimi and another one in the garage
7296106 we need to look forward we have time to work and have so many important races in front of us im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7296107 the first stint was nothing special but very good every lap i was pulling away by a couple of tenths
7296108 in the second stint we won the race there because the car was just perfect it was amazing to see the gap increasing
7296109 then in the last stint with the grip on the track and the temperature the car was even better on the soft tyres so i managed to drive in a really relaxing way but i was still doing similar lap times to the second stint the car was just perfect during the whole race

7296220 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7296221 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7296222 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7296223 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7296224 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7296225 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7296226 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7296227 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7296228 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7296229 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7296230 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7296231 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7296232 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7296233 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7296234 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7296235 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7296236 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7296237 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7296238 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7296239 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7296240 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7296241 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7296242 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7296243 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7296244 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7296245 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7296246 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7296247 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7296248 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7296249 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7296250 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7296251 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7296252 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7296253 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7296254 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7296255 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7296256 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7296257 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7296258 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7296259 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7296260 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7296261 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7296262 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7296263 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7296264 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7296265 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7296266 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7296267 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7296268 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7296269 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7296270 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7296271 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7296272 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7296273 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7296274 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7296275 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7296276 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7296277 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7296278 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7296279 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7296280 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7296281 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7296282 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7296283 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7296284 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7296285 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7296286 this is a planning took where all things are going
7296287 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7296288 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7296289 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7296290 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7296291 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7296292 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7296293 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7296294 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7296295 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7296296 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7296297 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7296298 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7296299 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7296300 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7296301 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7296302 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7296303 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7296304 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7296305 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7296306 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7296307 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7296308 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7296309 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7296310 liebe carol ich wei nicht was f r eine art weihnachten wir haben werden die n chsten sechs monate werden politisch schwierig vor allem wegen der arbeitlosigkeit aber wir werden das problem meistern konomisch wird sich die lage bessern bevor auch die arbeitslosenzahlen sinken werden
7296311 if there are stories that are from the top end or from darwin in particular that can then tour around australia or to asia or new zealand or even europe why not
7296312 there are some great storytellers up here some high profile others not so high profile whose work i think could be dramatised and thats something we might develop over a period of three years
7296313 on that level there might be 10 or even 20 or 30 small projects like that that we might kick off next year
7296314 but there is some really good work out there theatre thats made to talk to kids about things that are important to them
7296315 for me its about balance but i dont want to have a formula that is one third this and one third that
7296316 projects have to be here on merit there are a couple of shows that i have in mind from europe that ive seen before ive worked with the companies and i know i could bring them in here a few days earlier to work with some local artists not necessarily on their show but to concentrate on what their skill is
7296317 id hope we could get interest from other venues around australia so that we could co produce things
7296318 its had tremendous growth but there are still more things to develop with the festival
7296319 its a celebration of both cultures putting our life experiences together particularly from a womans perspective
7296320 so everyone who comes whether its the audience the artists the journalists the sponsors everybody brings something to the festival
7296321 you bring something that you can share with the people here that might be just a talk or you might be a brilliant puppet maker that can share that skill
7296322 everybody has a different opinion of what the festival means to them and what they want from it
7296323 theres such a broad demographic of people up here but we know those people who have supported the festival will come along with us if we change things

7296343 obesity is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of obstructive sleep apnea osa a corollary to this statement is that weight loss following bariatric surgery may not be sufficient to resolve osa
7296344 many individuals who initially achieve significant weight reductions regain a portion of their weight
7296345 it might be assumed that bariatric surgery resulting in significant weight loss would also improve obstructive sleep apnea
7296346 however many patients report persistent somnolence and snoring despite substantial weight loss
7296347 few studies have reported outcomes in terms of frequency of disease resolution using postoperative polysomnography
7296348 the severity of osa improved in only 50 of subjects
7296349 nearly half reported a persistence of daytime somnolence and more than half continued to have epworth sleepiness scale scores greater than 10
7296350 patients and healthcare practitioners should recognize that reliance on weight loss as a cure for osa may lead to an inappropriate cessation of cpap therapy
7296351 failing to recognize or treat persistent osa may significantly impact health and quality of life
7296352 despite numerous claims in the lay press that bariatric surgery can cure osa several studies have shown that osa may persist following weight loss
7296353 a very small minority of patients actually experienced resolution of obstructive events after sustained weight loss and many continued to require cpap therapy
7296354 recurrence or worsening of sleep apnea has been observed following an initial weight reduction even without a concomitant weight increase
7296355 overshadow the fact that surgical weight loss may not cure sleep disordered breathing
7296356 despite dramatic reductions in our patients apnea hypoxic index the overall prevalence and severity of osa remained high
7296357 patients who felt that their snoring had resolved were at much higher risk of inappropriately discontinuing cpap therapy
7296358 unfortunately resolution of subjective snoring did not predict reductions in the actual severity of osa
7296359 patients and physicians need to recognize that subjective resolution of snoring does not equate to improvements or cure of osa following weight loss
7296360 use of these criteria supports our concern that many if not most individuals will have persistent osa despite significant weight loss following surgery

7296387 they probably got that result because they wanted it a bit more and did the horrible things more than my players
7296388 the way the lad went down i thought he was going to be in hospital for three or four days
7296389 but hes got up and finished the game with no problem and that says it all so im disappointed by it
7296390 theyre steadily getting there and hopefully we might have one back for mondays home game with bath city

7296400 nicholas in case you read this intel won big time it will be hard to compete against the dells and intels of this world we all knew that and you did not accept the fact however where you could have been unique outstanding and special was guess what with education software out of the labs of mit and surrounding institutions and projects
7296401 a classmate based computer that will be produced in portugal and distributed to portuguese children on primary education for 50 free or at 20 for students on social aid as well as exported to other countries
7296402 nicholas you are a visionary yes you captured the imagination of many but intel actually carried the vision further and created a real product creating a real product is so much harder than prototyping
7296403 and no it does not help to to whine that intel and the big giants are against you you tried to beat the giants at their own game but when you try to do that then you actually have to be better than the big boys your sales department was not it was too small it was only you for a long time

7296414 i think its amazing after such a bad result to come here to a new track and do a fantastic job
7296415 it was difficult to choose the right tyres particularly in qualifying and i think we did a perfect job on that
7296416 making the pole position winning the race and making and the fastest lap theres nothing more we can ask for especially after such a bad result
7296417 we still need to work very hard becasue today we had another problem with kimi and another one in the garage
7296418 we need to look forward we have time to work and have so many important races in front of us im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7296419 the first stint was nothing special but very good every lap i was pulling away by a couple of tenths
7296420 in the second stint we won the race there because the car was just perfect it was amazing to see the gap increasing
7296421 then in the last stint with the grip on the track and the temperature the car was even better on the soft tyres so i managed to drive in a really relaxing way but i was still doing similar lap times to the second stint the car was just perfect during the whole race

7296437 in some cases im the first person to talk to these guys about their music in thirty years ive seen incredible things heard extraordinary stories in one instance i heard about people looking for a place to live be cause things have gotten so shitty in some of these places that they would just go into the vaults of recording studios and just grab all the tapes and pressing plates and old acetates and just burn it all just to make room for a place to sleep it began to dawn on me that if i didnt try to save this music no one would i decided to build an archive and rather that just bootleg the music like others often do id start trying to get the license and see what more i could discover

7296452 les taux dint r t ne sont pas le probl me mais le fait que les europ ens ont assist passivement la fa on dont leuro est devenu de plus en plus fort
7296453 les gardiens de la monnaie devraient prendre des mesures afin que leuro ne progresse pas encore une fois de fa on exorbitante
7296454 finalement avec un euro trop fort les europ ens importent la r cession des etats unis
7296455 a mon avis les gardiens de la monnaie europ enne ont commis une erreur capitale ils ont laiss leuro devenir trop fort en croyant aveugl ment que leurope serait suffisamment r sistante conomiquement pour se d tacher dun ralentissement de l conomie am ricaine

7296460 sua experi ncia pode acalmar aqueles que se preocupam com a pouca experi ncia de obama em assuntos mundiais
7296461 fortalece as credenciais da chapa democrata em pol tica externa e d a obama um candidato combativo quando se encaminha para a luta com o candidato republicano casa branca senador john mccain
7296462 em biden obama escolheu um senador conhecido por sua experi ncia em assuntos internacionais mas tamb m por sua destreza no combate pol tico
7296463 se obama pretende sanear a cultura pol tica de washington escolheu como seu escudeiro uma emin ncia parda n o um rosto novo
7296464 comparado com obama que freq entemente descrito como calmo e emotivo o senador joe biden direto e despreocupado
7296465 obama diz que representa um novo tipo de pol tica n o partid ria mas fez uma escolha conservadora de companheiro de chapa
7296466 biden em muitos sentidos o que obama n o tem experi ncia conhecedor de assuntos exteriores e cat lico
7296467 talvez e isto o mais importante n o seja temeroso com um hist rico de classe trabalhadora e estilo combativo biden poderia resistir s tentativas do partido republicano de qualificar obama de elitista
7296468 obama se exp s a duas cr ticas a de que est compensando sua pouca experi ncia como o presidente dos eua george w bush fez quando escolheu dick cheney e que a inclus o de biden enfraquece o argumento de obama segundo o qual a sabedoria mais importante do que a experi ncia
7296469 preciso dar cr dito a obama porque n o permitiu que estas obje es t ticas o impedissem de escolher um companheiro impressionante
7296470 deve se perguntar importante escolher algu m que me ajude a ganhar a elei o ou algu m que me traga benef cios se eu realmente ganhar
7296471 com sua escolha de joe biden obama sabiamente optou pelo ltimo
7296472 o fato de obama ter escolhido biden sugere que ele n o se intimida com os colaboradores e conselheiros fortes e conhecedores que possam questionar seu pensamento e que assumam tarefas importantes
7296473 obama escolheu o certo em vez do duvidoso e a experi ncia em lugar da mudan a
7296474 biden mostrou imediatamente que est pronto para assumir o papel tradicional de combatente agressivo e descreveu mccain como um homem muito rico que n o consegue entender os problemas do cidad o comum

7296477 uma figura p blica tem que pensar nisso um figurino essencial pode dizer tudo sobre a pessoa
7296478 o povo gosta de ver gente bem vestida gosta de se identificar com um pol tico que ascendeu socialmente que era pobre e chegou l e que agora est bem bonito elegante
7296479 o pol tico nunca pode estar extremamente bem vestido para n o ficar longe demais da popula o os primeiros ministros brit nicos por exemplo nunca est o t o bem vestidos quanto o pr ncipe charles
7296480 pe as de malha por exemplo s o muito informais n o passam essa sensa o
7296481 o candidato n o precisa ser uma pessoa bonita mas deve transmitir contemporaneidade ou ao menos transmitir o estilo do seu pensamento atrav s da forma como se veste
7296482 na rua o candidato tem que mostrar que elegante mas que est pr ximo do povo figurino de homem sempre muito cl ssico ele n o pode aparecer como se fosse um emo
7296483 imprescind vel estar atento aos detalhes levando em considera o acima de tudo as caracter sticas pessoais sen o corre se o risco da perda da identidade os looks cl ssicos neutralizam poss veis refer ncias taxativas e s o ideais para ocasi es de grande exposi o como o caso dos candidatos nas elei es

7296500 no momma the aisle seats are much better look how everyone has taken them first before the middle or window seats

7296505 how could i be happy living my dream if you werent living yours as well
7296506 the bean to bar process involves roasting the beans breaking them into small pieces called nibs and removing the shells referred to as winnowing grinding the nibs usually with sugar to form a chocolate paste then refining and conching very forceful kneading to produce the desired smoothness and to develop flavors
7296507 think chocolate cant get any better these willy wonkas beg to differ
7296508 because i think these two percentages of cacao taste completely different from one another and when you use only the finest ingredients you can taste the difference that 3 makes
7296509 a beautiful chocolate showcasing lively notes of plum preserves that intermingle with fruits rouges and enticing hints of butter hazelnut toffee importantly the cocoa butter is pressed right here in the patric chocolate facility from cacao of the exact same origin as that used in the bar this ensures that the flavor profile and bouquet of this delicious chocolate are consistent and un muddied by unrelated tastes and aromas
7296510 rich and inviting with notes of luscious citrus red wine and berries
7296511 chocolate lovers have become as snobbish and wordy as wine enthusiasts which in turn has made us pretty skeptical about claims made by new chocolatiers

7296518 an entrepreneurial explosion has occurred over the last few years in public education
7296519 the creativity exhibited by this new group of educators is helping raise student achievement empower teachers close the minority learning gap and bring hope to places where its been in very short supply its a movement that we believe sen obama and other democrats have taken to heart and we hope to see these reforms increase in schools across america during the obama administration
7296520 without a father he was forced to arm himself and to make his own way into the worlds he chose to join and to master
7296521 i think my strength actually comes in my case from the absence of a father at some level i had to raise myself my mother obviously was the dominant influence in my life and i had a stepfather and a grandfather who both participated in raising me and were good men who did good things for me but if i think about how i have been able to navigate some pretty tricky situations in my life it has to do with the fact that i had to learn to trust my own judgment i had to learn to fight for what i wanted
7296522 that will be the aim of much of the pageantry at the democratic convention
7296523 in the saga of ann dunham and her parents the campaign sees a mother lode of votes a biographical narrative to show he understands the economic fears and cultural cues of white middle class voters in swing states
7296524 but because many americans think obama is not what he actually is it has become that
7296525 for obama that is a potential problem particularly in a race that shows ever more signs of being extremely close
7296526 at some point these are issues thoughtful people will need to face head on rather than cede the ground to propagandists who traffic in intolerance and who deprived of the ability to make racial slurs with impunity simply shift their focus to religion
7296527 many have discoursed on what an obama victory could mean for america we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives
7296528 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to in this event the worlds judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race
7296529 modern campaigns are about flinging 10 things against the wall every day and hoping something sticks everything else from fund raising to advertising paid for by the fund raising to speechmaking to web strategy is in the service of applying that adhesive either to cement the candidates message or muck up the other guys engine with sludge
7296530 thats because memorable lines images gaffes and monikers act like a piece of gum on the bottom of your shoe in the world of marketing sticky branding means intentionally creating an emotional attachment to a consumer product
7296531 like fantasy football and baseball fantasy politics is an exercise in make believe that is intended to keep its players occupied and to make the winners feel good
7296532 the most exhaustive examination of the mccain and obama budget proposals ive found comes from the tax policy center
7296533 though details differ neither plan would realistically limit spending or eliminate deficits this is especially true when the obama and mccain health proposals are considered both would cost far more than 1 trillion over a decade says the tax policy center
7296534 good evidence that the customs and institutions that arise from the dominant personality of a place can shape the personalities of people who are not that way to begin with
7296535 toda a fotografia sempre uma manipula o embora haja a tend ncia para considerar que aquilo que captado pela objectiva de uma c mara tenha for osamente que existir
7296536 there is just too much offense for the u s team
7296537 we put it all out there on the floor every single time and we didnt leave anything for anybody else
7296538 i thought we were the team who played the best basketball this whole olympics and we were the team who was deserving of the gold medal
7296539 my advice would be that as democrats gather at the national convention they shouldnt be asking where the best parties are but where the local phone banks are
7296540 this is an absolute battleground if they want to help barack obama they should spend some time on the campaign trail
7296541 theres no doubt that colorado has become more competitive in the last month and a half
7296542 i think the opportunities for barack obama in the mountain west are enormous and its likely to make the difference for him
7296543 when you pick a running mate to correct a defect in your resume as has happened in this case you underscore the defect
7296544 the next leader of egypts banned extremist islamic group talks about barack obama cair and why he feels misunderstood
7296545 als ich ankam litt ich an grippe ich hatte aus diesem grund fast jeden tag ziemlich hohes fieber und wenig energie ich hatte zudem ein gro es problem mit einem spasmus im nacken was um ein haar dazu gef hrt h tte dass ich dieses wochenende nicht gefahren w re
7296546 ich wachte gestern sehr sehr fr h auf vor f nf uhr und ich hatte in meinem nacken einen spasmus gl cklicherweise habe ich einen gro artigen doktor der mir die ganze zeit ber zur seite stand es war so schlimm dass ich sogar probleme hatte aufzustehen und so bekam ich injektionen in meinen nacken und nahm jede menge schmerzmittel zu mir gl cklicherweise habe ich einen gro artigen trainer der geholfen hat pedro freute sich schon darauf zu fahren
7296547 ich bin mir ziemlich sicher dass das nicht noch einmal ein problem sein wird es hatte wohl etwas mit meinem kissen zu tun die art und weise wie ich schlief denn es trat auf als ich aufwachte
7296548 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7296549 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7296550 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7296551 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7296552 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7296553 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7296554 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7296555 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7296556 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7296557 were seeing locals stay here in a big big way
7296558 locals are coming here renting a cabana for the day eating at the restaurant at night and sleeping over
7296559 its out of left field but its a bonus that helps us sell out on the weekends
7296560 both the newly launched aloft and element hotels offer fantastic lobbies to encourage guests traveling the ability to be alone and together
7296561 aloft lexingtons lobby is a great space for local residents to mix mingle and enjoy signature cocktails at the xxyz bar
7296562 we actually have a lot of locals coming and staying for the weekend or the week
7296563 i think economics right now has demanded that people stay local and we find guests dont care if the hotel is only 10 or 20 miles from home
7296564 with all the amenities and events we do on the property its a mini disney vacation without spending the three grand
7296565 and the indoor water park makes it appealing to families all year round
7296566 theyre traveling closer to home and looking for added value
7296567 americans treat vacations as a birthright theyll go away but not as far and maybe not as long and the hotels are motivated to provide extra values
7296568 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7296569 what you saw today was a team everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals well what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7296570 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7296571 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world

7296579 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7296580 der sechs punkte plan ist nach jetzigem stand nicht erf llt

7296582 the people and things we are connected with in our personal networks who or that distribute or consume our capital which in turn influences our individual production outputs
7296583 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7296584 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7296585 one person on board the aircraft died and three were wounded during the incident
7296586 we re going to use that campus going forward as the backbone for shared services
7296587 credit suisse didn t have a lot of presence in the u
7296588 they were really much more interested in what was happening in the rest of the world
7296589 many companies after acquisitions look to cutting costs through expense saving synergies
7296590 i do not believe we have seen significant cost cutting initiatives at general casualty but management must be concerned that they do not undercut their core business value of talent and relationships with their agents
7296591 we did not have a direct insurance infrastructure in the u
7296592 said john lacava chief administrative officer of qbe the americas
7296593 we felt this would be a foundational piece for us
7296594 we re taking some functions we ve had around the united states and we re consolidating and bringing those jobs here
7296595 we see this as such a good mature well run organization that it s very easy now to scale from that
7296596 we really appreciate that effort they re going through to keep their headquarters in sun prairie
7296597 they bring quality jobs to our community they have the potential to expand in our community and we see that as a bonus
7296598 we re starting to see some synergies with some other companies that are owned by qbe
7296599 i read shakespeare and the bible and i can shoot dice thats what i call a liberal education
7296600 they have given their very best in a fair play environment and achieved amazing results by breaking 38 world records and 85 olympic records
7296601 the chinese people have honored their commitments they solemnly made
7296602 we always want a very powerful and successful host team to foster the enthusiasm in the entire population and you have achieved that four years beforehand
7296603 the city of chicago is wildly passionate about hosting the games the people are very much into it
7296604 our olympic heart will be right in center city in the parkland
7296605 these types of incidents happen regularly it is a daily event for all airlines he said
7296606 we owe this to the victims and passengers the md is a type of plane which is flying at the moment and as such it is of interest to global aviation to know exactly what happened interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba said yesterday
7296607 these types of incidents happen regularly it is a daily event for all airlines he said
7296608 whats the best day and time to launch an email campaign
7296609 they have a good squad and good organisation they are athletic and they have power
7296610 hes a very good player but he is a player of real madrid
7296611 apart from the goal which was a wonder strike from deco after that they havent really done that much against us
7296612 you can see why deco has played at the highest level he has that little bit of extra quality
7296613 deco once again with a bit of magic i think thats whats going to help us win the league this year
7296614 i dont think it was as good as last week against
7296615 about 5pm the temperature dropped drastically by 10 degrees from the high 30s ibrahims mother soraya ouaida said
7296616 with the changes of weather the ocean went a bit wild and sarah got pushed back by a wave and caught in a strong rip
7296617 but a child of eight what can he do its just too much for a little body an emotional ms ouaida recollected
7296618 all that time he kept smiling to her and saying youre going to be fine and i love you
7296619 please look after my sister my mother needs her shes very important before letting go
7296620 she always calls him her special angel and hero ms ouaida said
7296621 she writes poems about what happened and about her special brother who looked after her
7296622 the most important thing is having each other all the other things that people complain about are not really important
7296623 could be more concise but i guess it gets the message across
7296624 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president
7296625 figure out which of the kitchen tables to sit at
7296626 the first mainstream african american candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7296627 cheryl knew she was the new girl and had to get her relationship with dannii off to a good start
7296628 but theyve reached a stalemate and its stayed like that
7296629 the girls have tried to create a professional image in public but the truth is they dont even speak to each other
7296630 if they are standing together they stare straight ahead or look round for someone to talk to rather than make any attempt at chatting
7296631 danniis arrival last year was not marked with anywhere near the same fanfare as cheryls
7296632 but dannii is not interested in being a support artist in the
7296633 the best way to describe the glam metal emo pop tween group
7296634 is like the jonas brothers for girls who prefer chipped black nail polish and fishnet stockings to unicorn puffy stickers and purity rings
7296635 would you like to share a taxi with me its the same price as the bus
7296636 kanako since youre a slow hiker why dont you descend first and yuuki and i will catch up a few minutes later ill carry your backpack until we catch up with you then you have to carry it
7296637 well at least the town has good weather but how about 1500m higher up in the land of eternal fog

7296763 by posting an average annual volume growth of nearly 50 year on year the mongolian business has established itself as one of the strongest performing operations globally i am also delighted to see that the leadership of mcs coca cola has continuously demonstrated its commitment to invest in the development of its people and manufacturing facilities critical to ensure continued future growth of the coca cola business in mongolia
7296764 with the burgeoning beverage market in mongolia we have recorded remarkable growth rates in 2002 we sold 4 coca cola products to every average mongolian consumer in 2008 we are selling an average of 67 beverages to every mongolian consumer this has caused our first plant to run out of manufacturing capacity 7 years ahead of schedule
7296765 we are greatly encouraged by the outstanding performance of our bottling operation as both the bottling company and the coca cola company have exceeded all projections of profitability and sales our investment in the new plant is just our first step to bring world class manufacturing to mongolia

7296795 governor i cant find anything this man did wrong but because there is a plot against him im sending him to you and ordering his accusers to present their case to you
7296796 we have found this man to be a troublemaker stirring up riots among the jews all over the world he is a ringleader of the nazarene sect and even tried to desecrate the temple so we seized him by examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him
7296797 so then king agrippa i was not disobedient to the vision from heaven first to those in damascus then to those in jerusalem and in all judea and to the gentiles also i preached that they should repent and turn to god and prove their repentance by their deeds that is why the jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me but i have had gods help to this very day and so i stand here and testify to small and great alike i am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and moses said would happen that the christ would suffer and as the first to rise from the dead would proclaim light to his own people and to the gentiles
7296798 what i am saying is true and reasonable the king is familiar with these things and i can speak freely to him i am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice because it was not done in a corner king agrippa do you believe the prophets i know you do
7296799 do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a christian
7296800 short time or long i pray to god that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what i am except for these chains

7296802 pride goes before destruction a haughty spirit before a fall

7296805 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven
7296806 for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil some people eager for money have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs

7296808 do not boast about tomorrow for you do not know what a day may bring forth
7296809 i tell you now is the time of gods favor now is the day of salvation
7296810 i know this no way makes up for all the pain and suffering i gave you
7296811 all of my days i want to praise let every breath shout to the lord let us sing
7296812 then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free

7296822 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes bargaining chips or financial purposes
7296823 but journalists who spoke in condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seems to be a pre planned attack

7296906 kakek nenek tolong beritahu kepada kami resep akur dan cara kakek dan nenek mempertahan cinta selama ini agar kami yang muda muda bisa belajar
7296907 ini pengalaman kakek dan nenek yang tak mungkin terlupakan dan rasanya perlu kalian dengar dengan baik suatu hari kami berdua terlibat obrolan tentang sebuah artikel di majalah yang berjudul bagaimana memperkuat tali pernikahan di sana dituliskan masing masing dari kita diminta mencatat hal hal yang kurang disukai dari pasangan kita kemudian dibahas cara untuk mengubahnya agar ikatan tali pernikahan bisa lebih kuat dan bahagia nah malam itu kami sepakat berpisah kamar dan mencatat apa saja yang tidak disukai esoknya selesai sarapan nenek memulai lebih dulu membacakan daftar dosa kakekmu sepanjang kurang lebih tiga halaman kalau dipikir pikir ternyata banyak juga dan herannya lagi sebegitu banyak yang tidak disukai tetapi tetap saja kakek kalian menjadi suami tercinta nenekmu ini
7296908 nenek membacanya hingga selesai dan kelelahan dan sekarang giliran kakekmu yang melanjutakan bercerita
7296909 pagi itu kakek membawa kertas juga tetapi kosong kakek tidak mencatat sesuatu pun di kertas itu kakek merasa nenekmu adalah wanita yang kakek cintai apa adanya kakek tidak ingin mengubahnya sedikit pun nenekmu cantik baik hati dan mau menikahi kakekmu ini itu sudah lebih dari cukup bagi kakek
7296910 nenek sungguh sangat tersentuh oleh pernyataan kakekmu itu sehingga sejak saat itu tidak ada masalah atau sesuatu apa pun yang cukup besar yang dapat menyebabkan kami bertengkar dan mengurangi perasaan cinta kami berdua

7296919 one of the effects of paying so little attention to australia is that it is always such a pleasant surprise to find it there every cultural instinct and previous experience tells you that when you travel this far you should find at the very least people on camels there should be unrecognizable lettering on the signs and swarthy men in robes drinking coffee from thimble sized cups and puffing on hookahs and rattletrap busses and potholes in the road and a real possibility of disease on everything you touch but no its not like that at all this is comfortable and clean and familiar apart from the tendency of men of a certain age to wear knee high socks with shorts these people act just like you and me this is wonderful this is exhilarating this is why i love to come to australia

7296926 each time you fly from north america to australia and without anyone asking how you feel about it a day is taken away from you when you cross the international date line i left los angeles on january 3 and arrived in sydney fourteen hours later on january 5 for me there was no january 4 none at all where it went exactly i couldnt tell you all i know is that for one twenty four hour period in the history of earth it appears i had no being i find it a little uncanny to say the least i mean to say if you were browsing through your ticket folder and saw a notice that said passengers are advised that on some crossing twenty four hour loss of existence may occur which is of course how they would phrase it as if it happens from time to time you would probably get upand make some inquiries grab a sleeve and say excuse me there is it must be said a certain metaphysical comfort in knowing that you can cease to have material form and it doesnt hurt at all and to be fair they do give you the day back on the return journey when you cross the date line in the opposite direction and thereby manage to somehow arrive in los angeles before you left sydney which in its way of course is an even neater trick

7296945 to me he always acts like that he always stays on the outside to pass or to defend and then suddenly he closed the door when you have somebody on the inside who cant disappear then you have to leave him the space to go around the corner and he would have been on the inside for the next one if you make a mistake and are on the outside normally the wall is a bit closer so its easier to go in that

7296958 fortalece as credenciais da chapa democrata em pol tica externa e d a obama um candidato combativo quando se encaminha para a luta com o candidato republicano casa branca senador john mccain
7296959 em biden obama escolheu um senador conhecido por sua experi ncia em assuntos internacionais mas tamb m por sua destreza no combate pol tico
7296960 se obama pretende sanear a cultura pol tica de washington escolheu como seu escudeiro uma emin ncia parda n o um rosto novo

7296968 com sua escolha de joe biden obama sabiamente optou pelo ltimo
7296969 o fato de obama ter escolhido biden sugere que ele n o se intimida com os colaboradores e conselheiros fortes e conhecedores que possam questionar seu pensamento e que assumam tarefas importantes

7296971 at the end of the day if we dont learn from our mistakes we are not going to grow and whatever growth we do have will always come to nothing if we continue to make the same mistakes over and over
7296972 if we want to compete and win at this level we cant afford to make the same mistakes such as getting out the same way over and over which tells me that we are not assessing situations as well as we could
7296973 whatever the team requires they must be prepared to do that thats what being a mature individual is all about
7296974 i think we are maturing but doing so very slowly i believe if our guys put a bit more planning and commitment into their cricket they will succeed but at the end of the day we still have certain things to work on and players must be willing to work because its not just going to happen by saying it you have to put in the work
7296975 chris showed the amount of talent courage and will to succeed at this level while in the bowling department young kelly stefan held his own and continues to be a force to be reckoned with at this level
7296976 generally i thought he played very well and was very patient which is a good sign to see and hopefully he can go onto to do better things for bermuda
7296977 i thought he picked the bowlers and waited on the right balls to hit where he knew he was strong
7296978 the experienced players didnt put their hands up and perform as they could and they knew who they are
7296979 we had young and inexperienced players performing at a level beyond their maturity and then players that have been involved at this level for a number of years who didnt produce when it really mattered
7296980 i wore my abaya washed my face and took the children to my neighbor without saying a single word
7296981 i was in shock and the only thing i had in mind was my husband
7296982 in a moment the car stopped everything changed the way they were speaking with me moved from being kind to tough
7296983 i was scared and it worsened when a man with an ugly appearance appeared in the room and directly asked if i had a way to get the money to pay for my husbands life
7296984 i started to cry and say we were from a simple family and what we get from our work wasnt enough to pay our bills
7296985 the man said there was a way to pay for my husbands liberty as well as mine and told me to take my clothes off and lay down on the floor
7296986 i fought against him for a while but later discovered that i didnt have a choice and was raped by four militants who after all disgusting things they did to me drove me back home with my husband
7296987 he said he preferred to die than continue to be married to an impure woman
7296988 i saved his life but couldnt save mine after six years of marriage

7297012 that really changed the dads mind about how wise kids are using technology
7297013 his point was that schools shouldnt ban the use of the devices but learn from the students and also create an environment that promotes technology
7297014 its exciting but i think we need to stay focused on what the outcomes are for kids as far as content
7297015 if a student brings their own laptop is it going to be on the schools network then what about viruses and filtering
7297016 im not sure schools are quite comfortable with it yet

7297227 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7297228 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7297229 it is said that if you want to find out a secret ask lynx medicine unfortunately it is difficult to get the silent lynx to speak to be confronted by the powerful medicine of lynx signifies that you do not know something about yourself or others
7297230 lynx medicine is a very special type of clairvoyance if this medicine is strong in you you will get mental pictures concerning other people and the exact things they have hidden either from themselves or from others you will see their fears their lies and their self deceptions you will also know where they have the treasure if there is any you will never speak of these revelations you simply know
7297231 if you have pulled the lynx card you can be sure that secrets are afloat if this is your personal medicine you should listen to your higher self be still and pay attention to the revelations you receive either in the form of mental pictures or through a high singing voice in your inner ear perhaps you will receive information in the form of omens you can be sure that mother earth is signaling to you in some manner some people believe that the sphinx of ancient egypt was not a lion but a lynx this lynx does not say much with an enigmatic smile the great cat watches over the sands of time forever

7297247 the games are like a decathlon only the end result counts
7297248 we are not far from our objective for the london 2012 olympic games of reaching the top 25 in medal ranking

7297253 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
7297254 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
7297255 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
7297256 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
7297257 do you even know how to read music or is bluegrass really just for the unqualified

7297262 they were shooting the ball well today and when they get going like that they are tough to stop
7297263 you never want to get in a scoring battle with the hungarians because they are such great shooters we wanted to make it a defensive game but we just didnt get it done
7297264 you always got to believe you have a chance to win but when the seconds are ticking down and you realize were gonna probably not win this game thats a slap in the face it stings
7297265 we were with them for awhile but they just kept coming and thats why they are three time consecutive gold medal champions
7297266 its gonna hurt tonight its going to hurt tomorrow and for a few days but as the weeks and months go by the players are going to realize what a huge accomplishment it is
7297267 nobody expected them to do anything here they had a great run and theyve got a lot to be proud of
7297268 solo dopo averti preso la mano sentendola cos vicina alla mia ho sentito veramente la stretta del tuo cuore porta la tua mano vicino al mio cuore ora lo puoi sentire sta cantando in questa mia vita ho provato cos tante emozioni ogni genere demozione della quale io non conosca nome stata provata ho sentito un usignolo cantare stamattina ho aperto la finestra ho sospirato la vita un dono ma spesso penso che sia come un gioco di fortuna e di abilit chi meglio sa giostrare le sue pedine riuscir infine a trovare larmonia che riesce a mantenere in equilibrio tutto quanto posso provare a immaginare come sar la mia vita senza di te qui accanto a me ma quando provo a immaginare la mia vita sapendo che tu non esisti mi sento morire dentro

7297272 do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward
7297273 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
7297274 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father

7297279 ive seen a big improvement in the u s teams play between 04 and 08
7297280 i think they took this tournament very seriously they were very hungry they gave a better feeling of a team it wasnt so much individual stuff individual talent
7297281 we have so many opportunities to grow and there are just markets that are exploding all over the world

7297294 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7297295 there is no evidence of listeria contamination in product beyond the production lines originally under investigation
7297296 tragically our products have been linked to illness and loss of life to those people who are ill and to the families who have lost loved ones i offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies
7297297 this week our best efforts delivering the highest quality safe food have failed us for that we are deeply sorry we know this has shaken consumer confidence in us our actions will continue to be guided by putting their interest first
7297298 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7297299 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7297300 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7297301 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7297302 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7297303 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7297304 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7297305 and so we believe the games had a good influence

7297308 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7297309 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7297310 barbarians thats what they are they kill innocent people here how many kilometers outside the battlefield they bombed all over georgia
7297311 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7297312 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7297313 many restroom attendants at local fairs work in hot uncomfortable conditions in the dead of summer and it is absolutely mind boggling to me that a company would have the audacity to avoid paying these workers at least a minimum wage
7297314 worse yet this company saw nothing wrong with taking half of these tips back from the workers here in new york this way of doing business is over for portlock maintenance systems

7297319 the nieman foundation appreciates the support of the gates foundation in creating these fellowships for journalists who are committed to global health reporting and whose news organizations share that commitment
7297320 the extent of global health problems is enormous and the public and policymakers are not sufficiently well informed effective reporting on disease and the treatment of disease is a critical part of building broad understanding about illnesses that burden the worlds poorest people over time we expect the work of the nieman global health fellows to make a difference
7297321 by joining the journalistic experience of the nieman foundation with the expertise of the harvard school of public health these fellowships will help ensure that committed well trained journalists will continue to highlight critical problems and solutions in global health
7297322 this new initiative underscores the far reaching influence that well informed journalists can have in drawing the worlds attention to the challenges of hiv aids malaria tb and other health threats in developing countries
7297323 we are grateful to the gates foundation for its support
7297324 we are interested in identifying projects that can make an impact on the publics understanding of global health issues
7297325 the results of the fieldwork might be stories a case study or a handbook of best practices related to reporting on health in a developing country
7297326 attention to the woman entering stonewall station you were told to leave if you do not exit onto the road someone will come and get you

7297328 its amazing what you can do at such a low income level
7297329 alone none of these errors or any of the other unexplained omissions including counsels waiver of an opening statement waiver of cross examination of certain witnesses giving a cursory and unorganized closing statement and failing to object to inflammatory statements made during the prosecutions closing argument which included calling defendant a
7297330 however considering the totality of the circumstances presented here we are convinced that no legitimate trial strategy existed for counsels actions which when considered in the aggregate deprived defendant of meaningful representation

7297335 the real madrid would never want to retain a player against his wishes and as a result they have no alternative but to accept his unilateral decision to rescind his contract if that is what the player wants
7297336 more than likely the results stem from a combination of physiological and mental factors
7297337 um fil sofo um homem que experimenta v ouve suspeita espera e sonha constantemente coisas extraordin rias que atingido pelos pr prios pensamentos como se eles viessem de fora de cima e de baixo como por uma esp cie de acontecimentos e de fa scas de que s ele pode ser alvo que talvez ele pr prio uma trovoada prenhe de rel mpagos novos um homem fatal em torno do qual sempre ribomba e rola e rebenta e se passam coisas inquietantes
7297338 there is no reason we wouldnt want him to perform and i dont know why we didnt contact him
7297339 i am surprised by the level of affection for me and for 19
7297340 have been listening to your two albums when i can
7297341 however unfortunately our long range patrol vehicles dont come standard with cd players so we cant listen to your songs in the lup lying up post
7297342 instead were stuck listening to the local call to prayer five times a day
7297343 i owe my life to the choppers at long tan
7297344 this is an extremely difficult time for me and my family my main concern at the moment is the welfare of our family
7297345 i appreciate everything that owners sean buckley dave mueller and gabrielle guenzi have done for me by keeping me on her
7297346 it was one of those things i thought she was running in the mcewen so i committed myself to bel mer circumstances are always different but mick has been one of my best supporters so the least i could do is repay that faith
7297347 once we got hold of the ball and moved it forward quickly we knew dan and fab and carlos hernandez would cause a lot of trouble and that was exactly how it worked out
7297348 it was just great to see both the performance and the result
7297349 weve got 21 rounds to get in the finals so you can never lose sight of that fact
7297350 but lifes much easier if you pick up points early on theres a good feel around the team and picking up points is just vital all the way through
7297351 were not going to win every week but it certainly helps
7297352 those who criticised when we got kewell should talk now id be curious to hear what they have to say
7297353 he might be fit for next week but we will find out in the next couple of days
7297354 there are currently negotiations with west ham and glasgow rangers but i am hoping he stays he is a player who makes a difference
7297355 i have to do three weeks quarantine in melbourne before hong kong so it makes sense to get a run in while down there but its hard to work out whether theres a suitable race
7297356 a lot depends on the handicapper in those big mile races
7297357 to start from the pole here for the first time for sure is very nice
7297358 the track here is not very easy especially the surface which is a little bit slippery so to make the perfect lap is always difficult
7297359 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7297360 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7297361 felipes going to be hard to beat but well certainly push for it
7297362 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7297363 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7297364 lets make it real clear im not apologising for it
7297365 well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7297366 you come off the field thinking whos injured this week
7297367 its one of our options well just have to have a look
7297368 whoever has come in this year has played awesome and i suppose whoever replaces thommo and herbie will get the job done too
7297369 overall i was happy with the performance but there was probably a little too much to play for for canberra today
7297370 it was a fantastic finish its always important to win but to win in this way with the passion and commitment of the players is much better
7297371 this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points
7297372 its good to look over my shoulder and see a scoring option like cisse on the bench
7297373 when that cross came in sometimes its written in the stars
7297374 clearly its a worry that weve got specific job losses occurring in certain companies but that of course is part and parcel of overall economic activity
7297375 i think its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what you have to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is in reasonably good shape
7297376 we did an examination of those suppliers and 46 of the 200 have a turnover under 50 million
7297377 we are at a point where we have to act and act quickly on tariffs

7297382 this is the best group of women they all really care about each other
7297383 great group of mommys make you feel welcomed for everything
7297384 love it truly a great group of women and babies
7297385 clearly london has always been a financial center but i think the talk over the last 12 to 18 months even mayor bloomberg in new york hinted at it is that it will become the financial center
7297386 thats a very big statement to be making and if you go back 6 or 10 years i dont think anyone would have actually made it
7297387 practically speaking london makes a lot of sense not only in terms of the travel times but also time zone differences
7297388 theres been a fair amount of times when im talking to colleagues in mumbai its just easier
7297389 the united kingdom as a nation and the u k government in particular has been particularly focused on being very supportive of a true free market economy
7297390 resist unnecessary regulation and overtaxation that would drive business and investors elsewhere
7297391 because of the way london lives and breathes you have the ability to work seven days a week and you can easily bring in friends and family
7297392 i read through my work over a whole bunch of cups of coffee
7297393 from time to time ill invite friends to come for lunch what i find most often is that they say thats a good idea and they bring work too
7297394 i have always enjoyed being out in life and because i love what i do it consumes me when i am there
7297395 leave a voicemail for yourself in new york and leave a voicemail for yourself in london
7297396 i guarantee if you stand on a street in new york and leave yourself a voicemail for long enough youll hear sirens the police youll hear a lot of honking a lot of shouting do it on the streets of london and you probably wont hear a single taxi
7297397 one of the things i love most about london is the people who live here
7297398 if i really want to unwind it typically is at someones home sitting around the kitchen while someones cooking and everyones pitching in over a glass of barolo
7297399 when you come to london people very much retain their cultural and national identities so youre from spain and you will always be from spain or from ethiopia or the north of england
7297400 it defines the food the culture the fashion the people the talk in a way that makes it fascinating to experience
7297401 it opens your eyes to what is going on in the world not from your perspective but from lots of other peoples perspectives
7297402 thats a very important thing as the world gets smaller
7297403 i think london has a singularly unique ability to be a modern center culturally financially politically while at the same time holding on in a very proud way to a long history going back through the ages
7297404 this leather goods shop is run by the gentleman who owns it who is passionate about what he does its not about buying a brand its about buying quality
7297405 when you go for your 7 30 you see all the business guys in suits then you leave at 9 00 or 9 30 and the fashionistas come in the whole place turns over and you get a much more fashionable cool crowd

7297408 having miles of packed dirt to run on surrounded by manicured gardens open park and waterways is perfection

7297410 when working late i typically order sushi in itsu does a very nice job theyre everywhere
7297411 its this charming little dive of a place but it is legendary amongst the asian community

7297416 the fire of the chinese peoples passion to embrace the world will burn forever

7297423 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions

7297433 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7297434 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7297435 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7297436 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7297439 the success of the beijing olympic games is attributable to the concerted efforts of the chinese people and people from the rest of the world
7297440 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends across the world who have been involved in the games in various ways
7297441 a grand event of international sports competition and cultural exchanges
7297442 since the opening of the beijing games friends from all parts of the world have come together in the chinese capital to experience the charm of the international olympic movement

7297519 this man deserves to be honored he has made us happy
7297520 it shows you this region has another face and has things to celebrate
7297521 it is a source of pride for us not for us alone but for all sudanese people
7297522 i cant find words to express my joy this is an achievement for my country first and then for me
7297523 i was able to achieve this honor because of a lot of hard training
7297524 one of the things i was very pleased with us last year is that we finished games
7297525 we finished the season extremely well and we have to continue to do that
7297526 hopefully this year we can start off a lot stronger and a lot faster than weve done as far as the season goes and also at the beginning of games
7297527 if we do have the intangible qualities as our team had last year with the talent we have then we have a chance at some point to be a good football team during the course of this season
7297528 i definitely believe we can play with teams like auburn and alabama last year we played well against tennessee and south carolina but felt like we let those games get away from us late we believe we can be better and win those games this year
7297529 we won eight games and went to the liberty bowl but we want to go out and prove we are even better this year
7297530 weve got more national championships we got more players in the pros so our talent level in this conference is the best in the country
7297531 the quality of our coaches is the best in the country if youre going to compete in this conference youve got to prepare well and youve got to play well every week
7297532 its really great croom cares about us as a man and a person both on and off the field
7297533 we take it as a great opportunity to play for the first black head coach in the sec what hes doing now is opening doors for a lot of people
7297534 thats what is great about coach croom he doesnt sugar coat things
7297535 hell tell you when you need to be working harder and in which areas you need to improve
7297536 we had a good spring and if we have good two a days we can look forward to a good opener against louisiana tech
7297537 hopefully well get off to a good start and keep it rolling but we have to focus on each game without looking ahead
7297538 if the community doesnt trust us it makes our job harder
7297539 we dont have enough man power to enforce the local and state laws right now
7297540 by us bringing in another area of enforcement all its going to do is diminish what we were sanctioned to do crime fighting
7297541 im not talking about two weeks of training or three weeks of training
7297542 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
7297543 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
7297544 it seems to me ice used this as nothing more than a publicity ploy as a means to justify their harsh enforcement of immigration law
7297545 there is no all out war only all out peace in mindanao
7297546 bravo and pangalian to the proper authorities because they are
7297547 they are the ones that we expect to create problems even after a final peace agreement has been signed
7297548 we are not putting the peace talks in the backburner the peace process moves on
7297549 it is in this light that military and police forces as part of their pursuit operations and representatives from various government agencies are to touch base and work closely with local government officials and community leaders in areas affected to ensure the delivery of necessary social services to people
7297550 the talks will continue the matter of disarmament will be a subject that can be effectively addressed when the peace agreement is signed

7297577 and whosoever disbelieves in faith then fruitless is his work and in the hereafter he will be among the losers
7297578 and indeed it has already been revealed to you as it was to those before you that if you join others with allah in worship then surely all your deeds will be in
7297579 it is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards east or west but it is righteousness to believe in allah and the last day and the angels the book and the messengers
7297580 the messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his lord as do the believers each one of them believes in allah his angels his books and his messengers they say we make no distinction between one another of his messengers and they say we hear and we obey we seek your forgiveness our lord and to you is the end of all journeys
7297581 o you who believe believe in allah and his messenger and the scripture which he sent to his messenger i e the quraan and the scripture which he sent to those before him any who disbelieves in allah his angels his books his messengers and the last day has indeed gone far far astray
7297582 know you not that allah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth verily it is all in the book al lauh al mahf z verily that is easy for allah
7297583 iman or faith is to believe in allah his angels his books his messengers the last day and to believe in destiny the good of it and the bad of it
7297584 is when two of the little hunchers land together on your ear and start singing their birthday songs at the top of their lungs
7297585 its like they want you to hear them as if it brings them an even greater procreative joy black maggots with wings fuh fuh fornicating on your ear like that you can even feel the little beggars humping away its usually like one two three and off they go again
7297586 thats unless you happen to be in possession of a flyswatter in the right hand at the right time or god forbid a two by four because when the flies do that you know they are doing it with purpose and there aint nothing for it cept to destroy that unnatural aberration
7297587 i have two buds who were driving back from tallahassee one night trying to get to miami by sunrise around about midnight somewhere near kissimee the driver joe shook the passenger gary awake joe asked gary what the devil he thought that tiny little light off in the distance was and gary got a focus on the light joe was pointing to just about the time both of them realized it was the reflection of the eyeball of some stupid cow standing in the middle of the road bang
7297588 when the cow got hit by the car it gave off something like a death scream going moooooooo eeeeeee through the air to its final resting place in the ditch alongside the road
7297589 that crazy cousin of mine in maine called last night her grandpa on her mothers side passed away two nights ago old man had raised beagles to hunt with as soon as the old man passed them dogs started howling and carrying on and just wouldnt stop
7297590 they had to take them down to the vet today and have them all put to sleep every last one of them dogs were killing themselves in grief but how did they know how did they know
7297591 i mean its things like this make people ask that question of questions why
7297592 are we part of god that can only get here by being born into these bodies that would sure explain all the pain and hate and confusion but what does that make all other life a part of god as well but lesser as female and male are only two halves of god all lesser forms of the whole
7297593 oh no now were all going to get that new kind of aids called hearing aids you get it from listening to assholes
7297594 that was a good result and a great performance by the team the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7297595 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship

7297616 i had a good start to the race and gained three places to 13th but that was the highlight of my race really we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid after we had expected to perform a lot better i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
7297617 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pit lane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race we need to get to the bottom of the brake problems that we have had all weekend as these cost me a lot of time and positions it was a poor weekend overall
7297618 jenson got a good start and was able to make up three places during the first lap however the midfield was quite close today and with a heavy fuel load he was unable to progress through the field starting rubens from the pit lane was the right decision as he benefited from the mel e at turn 2 and ended up being further up the field than he would otherwise have been contrary to expectation though there was relatively low attrition with only three cars failing to finish and no safety cars which meant there were no real opportunities to take advantage of
7297619 fundamentally we have improved the car over the august break and we saw clear signs of that progress in free practice

7297625 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
7297626 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation

7297630 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7297631 what you saw today was a team everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals well what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7297632 from day one weve been together its been a bond for the last three years
7297633 this team has come a long way and we had a lot of blowouts those first few games so it was fitting that this one would be a close one it really tested us to see what we were all about and in the end we showed were the best in the world
7297634 the good news is unsolicited five or six of these guys said they want to be part of this going forward
7297635 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7297636 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that

7297649 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7297650 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7297651 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7297652 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7297730 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi before the first corner however im not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction as a result i could close the gap to robert kubica a little at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer having said that its good that the team scored a lot of points with lewiss second place and my fourth place
7297731 we saw another extremely solid vodafone mclaren mercedes team performance today the result of which was a very useful clutch of championship points but in truth we lost the chance of outright victory yesterday in qualifying
7297732 but the nature of the circuit dictated that it was always going to be difficult for him to overtake today and that being the case we opted fairly early on to take the championship strategic option of settling for second place following on from his victory in hungary heikki also drove very strongly and helped bolster our points total in the constructors championship he responded well to the pressure applied by kimi and thoroughly deserved his fourth place

7297774 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7297775 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7297776 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7297777 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere

7297849 the little girl has been taken to hospital suffering from injuries from her fall we wish her well with her recovery
7297850 she missed two pks and hit the post twice she was really upset with her herself and she shouldnt be
7297851 shes a fabulous player and set up the goal that we scored we are where we are because of her
7297852 she was at the right spot and wehre we wanted her to be
7297853 if you dont capitalize when you have those opportunities you pay for it later we capitalized on ours and fortunately they didnt on theirs
7297854 we had a lot of opportunities and we didnt capitalize on them
7297855 we work on them every day in practice and my coaches just said watch their hips and take your best guess and thats what i did
7297856 she had a little bit to prove tonight and she did and played very very well
7297857 we still wanted to come out and play hard no matter what
7297858 in that particular year we beat them in the playoffs so i would love for history to repeat itself
7297859 we do have a lot of speed and we like to spread the field both defensively and offensively
7297860 we like to use the speed on defense to control the ball and it lets us make plays
7297861 its important to win the midfield and with three new players out there they did a good job
7297862 were very deep and its ahrd to keep the talent on the bench so we try to rotate them we try to keep the flow of the game we dont want to lose the flow of the game but were really fortunate to be able to mix and match
7297863 i knew we had injured players so i really wanted to step it up and prove that i can play
7297864 im just trying to earn my time and during the game i was just really focused and really tried to pay attention to where i had to be on the field
7297865 i love it playing on a deep team because we have really good teamwork
7297866 i might not get as much playing time as i would if i was playing on a team that wasnt as good but since we are such a good team its nice to do whatever i can to help
7297867 we were ready to be physical and we were ready to be first to the ball
7297868 we were mentally ready and it didnt translate into physically ready we didnt step to the ball and we had the ball taken away when you dont have the ball you cant win the game
7297869 we played a great team but we knew we had a great team a better team we dominated the entire game and it was a win that we deserved because we beat them we outplayed them the whole game
7297870 i feel like tonight was the north bayside championship game
7297871 unless something crazy happens kent island will probably end up winning the north
7297872 we knew the goal was going to come it was just a matter of time
7297873 at first i thought it was going to out but then i knew i could get to it
7297874 we did cover for each other well and we were able to save a couple of balls early on we got lucky in the beginning a couple of times
7297875 i knew it was going to come down to who got the breaks we got our one break and i was hoping that would be enough
7297876 i thought the call was a tough acll to make
7297877 we had all ball in my opinion even if it was a little from behind it was all ball in an overtime game you dont make that call
7297878 to be on the losing ened it stinks with the way those two goals went by
7297879 we knew it was going to be a tough game and a battle kent island just came out stronger than we did
7297880 i didnt know what to do so i just shot it and thank god that it went in
7297881 was one goal enough and obviously it wasnt i hope we realize that with 20 minuets to go a one goal lead isnt good enough and we have to keep on battling and fighting hard we know we are going to be a good team we are just not quite there yet
7297882 i know we are not where we are going to be and thats why it is very unfortunate to play this game so early
7297883 kent island pulled it out so they might be a little ahead of us but we are looking forward to seeing them again
7297884 it feels good to win because we knew coming into north caroline that they were going to play us tough because they always do
7297885 you never know how your team is going to respond and for the first half north caroline had some chances and that made me a little nervous
7297886 shes just a tremendous athlete and is smart on the field
7297887 she kind of controls our team we know when she is on the field and near the ball good things are going to happen
7297888 as a senior she gets to pass it down and she gave it to me it means a lot to know that she trusted me to take her position on the team
7297889 we were doing great things in the first half and we had opportunities we just didnt capitalize
7297890 but as soon as we start to capitalize it becomes a lot easier
7297891 we all played together and it was more of a team effort i was just there to score the goals
7297892 in the second half we started to play as a team win the 50 50 balls and good things started to happen
7297893 they are a great team and they just keep reloading they are the team that we want to get after and we did get after them in the first half we just couldnt finish
7297894 we need to get in a little more soccer shape and we just ran out of gas
7297895 they can go 25 deep where we have just 16 and that makes a difference
7297896 anytime you can play teams on the western shore its going to be a good test
7297897 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
7297898 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
7297899 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
7297900 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late

7298036 this is showing those who arent religious that there are other social groups im not going to pretend im religious so i can be part of a group
7298037 theyre making a decision that theres life without god and were concerned about it
7298038 they believe were moral relativists who dont believe in truth
7298039 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved
7298040 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
7298041 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
7298042 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
7298043 been reading your blog for quite some months now however unless im mistaken there is something of an omission from the listings what should you be feeling if you fail to get a pupillage the first time around im in that boat having done the oxbridge thing i went to city and did ok ish on the conversion course high commendation with a few distinctions i got quite a few second round interviews 7 to be precise but got absolutely nothing apart from a few reserve places that did not materialise i was and still am pretty distraught over the failure and really dont know what to do for the sake of frankness i feel pretty much locked into the bvc having paid the cash thanks to the beautiful deadlines for finding out about pupillage and feel like a very undesirable candidate at the risk of turning your blog into a psychologists couch what should someone like me be thinking is the second attempt going to be a fruitless one is there going to be any sort of discrimination as a result of the first failure having not set the world alight in my conversion course am i now a less valuable prospect should i not apply to the same chambers as the outcome will be inevitable what should i be doing for the horrible intervening year after the bvc

7298049 an entrepreneurial explosion has occurred over the last few years in public education
7298050 the creativity exhibited by this new group of educators is helping raise student achievement empower teachers close the minority learning gap and bring hope to places where its been in very short supply its a movement that we believe sen obama and other democrats have taken to heart and we hope to see these reforms increase in schools across america during the obama administration
7298051 without a father he was forced to arm himself and to make his own way into the worlds he chose to join and to master
7298052 i think my strength actually comes in my case from the absence of a father at some level i had to raise myself my mother obviously was the dominant influence in my life and i had a stepfather and a grandfather who both participated in raising me and were good men who did good things for me but if i think about how i have been able to navigate some pretty tricky situations in my life it has to do with the fact that i had to learn to trust my own judgment i had to learn to fight for what i wanted
7298053 that will be the aim of much of the pageantry at the democratic convention
7298054 in the saga of ann dunham and her parents the campaign sees a mother lode of votes a biographical narrative to show he understands the economic fears and cultural cues of white middle class voters in swing states
7298055 but because many americans think obama is not what he actually is it has become that
7298056 for obama that is a potential problem particularly in a race that shows ever more signs of being extremely close
7298057 at some point these are issues thoughtful people will need to face head on rather than cede the ground to propagandists who traffic in intolerance and who deprived of the ability to make racial slurs with impunity simply shift their focus to religion
7298058 many have discoursed on what an obama victory could mean for america we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives
7298059 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to in this event the worlds judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race
7298060 modern campaigns are about flinging 10 things against the wall every day and hoping something sticks everything else from fund raising to advertising paid for by the fund raising to speechmaking to web strategy is in the service of applying that adhesive either to cement the candidates message or muck up the other guys engine with sludge
7298061 thats because memorable lines images gaffes and monikers act like a piece of gum on the bottom of your shoe in the world of marketing sticky branding means intentionally creating an emotional attachment to a consumer product
7298062 like fantasy football and baseball fantasy politics is an exercise in make believe that is intended to keep its players occupied and to make the winners feel good
7298063 the most exhaustive examination of the mccain and obama budget proposals ive found comes from the tax policy center
7298064 though details differ neither plan would realistically limit spending or eliminate deficits this is especially true when the obama and mccain health proposals are considered both would cost far more than 1 trillion over a decade says the tax policy center

7298127 salman arrived on set of yuvraj feeling a bit unwell before he could begin his filming he started vomiting instead of canceling the shoot immediately as suggested by unit members he insisted on resting a bit and then resuming

7298139 we are aware of gang rivalries when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm

7298141 china has been quick to catch up with india and surpass it in terms of art prices despite paying attention to art post 2004 bulk of the buyers of chinese art are westerners who started looking to quality chinese art in galleries spread across hong kong the indian market on the other hand is homegrown
7298142 few people were interested in chinese artists and their art
7298143 the global nature of the collectors have changed most of them have made money on their own which has given an amount of self confidence they see good things about indian and chinese art on the front pages of newspapers and flock to the global sales
7298144 now you have celebrities collectors like charles saatchi and frank cohen buying indian art i am sure we will cross the chinese market in the next three to four years
7298145 they are more focused on quality and only the best are being picked up it has never happened in the art market before

7298211 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly

7298280 i would like to appeal for calm in the sense that a life has been wasted and if there is tension within the community then people need to talk to the police
7298281 we are aware of gang rivalries when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm
7298282 we are very much alive to the intelligence that comes from the community itself and we have put extra resources on the ground we have put on high visibility patrols and that does include armed patrols
7298283 this type of crime does remain rare in terms of gun crime in birmingham one murder is one murder too many and we will pull out all the stops to bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion
7298284 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7298285 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7298286 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable

7298361 love those who serve god and who render strict justice and hate covetousness

7298364 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
7298365 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
7298366 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
7298367 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects

7298372 when a landmine explodes the combination of sand and air pressure tosses the vehicle and the driver up in the air we have to find a method to absorb the pressure something that is lightweight and doesnt take up much space we dont yet have the technology but were working with the design tools that we have already developed

7298376 there is a tension at the heart of our efforts to collaborate this tension and its possible resolution is best captured by the following questions
7298377 het is alleszins nog te vroeg om een doorgedreven analyse te maken dat doen we zeker de komende dagen globaal gezien hebben de belgische sporters te weinig medailles in de wacht gesleept
7298378 de gouden medaille van tia hellebaut en de zilveren van de vrouwen op de 4x100 meter zijn zeker schitterende medailles ze getuigen van wereldtop en daar mogen we best fier op zijn
7298379 soms scheelde het weinig of de belgen hadden alsnog een medaille in de wacht gesleept
7298380 in samenwerking met alle partners wil ik een duidelijk actieplan voor 2009 2012 opstellen met duidelijke doelstellingen voor onder meer de spelen van londen we moeten duidelijke keuzes maken en hard inzetten op de dingen waarin we geloven
7298381 het zoeken van sporttalent kost veel tijd in 2004 ben ik begonnen met het uittekenen van een vlaams topsportbeleid daarvoor bereikten we mooie resultaten in sommige sportdisciplines maar die waren eerder ge soleerd in 2004 hadden we 6 miljoen euro voor een topsportbeleid voor 2009 trekken we 22 miljoen euro uit
7298382 een totale balans van mijn topsportbeleid kunnen we pas na twaalf jaar dus in 2016 opmaken
7298383 en als de franse gemeenschap ook hard investeert in topsport kan belgi zelfs de top vijftien bereiken
7298384 ik ben super tevreden met deze zege het was een moeilijke rally en eerlijk af en toe hebben we wat geluk gehad op momenten dat we voluit in de aanval gingen maar na alle tegenslagen sinds het begin van het seizoen mag het ook al eens meezitten zaterdag kregen we een geweldige strijd met mijn teammaat nicolas vouilloz peugeot 207 s2000 jammer dat hij zondag snel technische problemen kreeg ik moest de wedstrijd dan controleren en dat is niet makkelijk ik had een ruime voorsprong en moest geconcentreerd blijven maar het lukte geweldig de volgende wedstrijd wordt in spanje gereden dat wordt een compleet nieuwe rally voor mij ik weet niet wat ik er moet van verwachten maar deze zege geeft me alvast veel vertrouwen voor het vervolg van het kampioenschap
7298385 ik had wat last van onderstuur slipte en gleed op een brug aan de kant van de co rijder de deur was beschadigd maar erger was dat de elektrische kabel van de starter was gebroken waardoor we niet meer konden starten het is moeilijk om zon wedstrijd te beginnen zonder enige vorm van voorbereiding de eerste vier klassementsritten heb ik echt gezwommen ik vond geen goede afstelling nadien ging het beter een testsessie organiseren bewijst dus wel degelijk zijn nut want dan ben je vanaf de eerste meters mee ik rij zeker nog de rally van san remo eind september en misschien de rally du valais eind oktober maar dan hopelijk wel met een goede voorbereiding

7298397 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work

7298399 stanley has absolutely no taste and no feelings for the people involved

7298401 those sorcerers you spoke of from the adjacent kingdoms could any of them do up a set of trumps
7298402 yes but theirs would be less than perfect it is my understanding that you have to be an initiate of either the pattern or the logrus to do them properly some of them could do a sort of half assed set though one youd be taking your chances on using maybe winding up dead or in some limbo sometimes getting where you were headed
7298403 and then there are the inhabitants of the various shadow kingdoms nearest to amber and to chaos those at both ends breed mighty sorcerers just because of their proximity to the two power centers some of the good ones can become fairly adept at it but their images of the pattern or the logrus are imperfect so theyre never quite as good as the real thing
7298404 we suggest that public health campaigns will be more successful if they attend to how behaviors act as markers or signals of identity

7298563 the most intangible legacy is that throughout the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world

7298565 london will be constrained in that they will have an actual budget and cant haul in a thousand workers from the countryside force them to build buildings and then send them back again

7298567 we acknowledge that the situation has not been perfect but we acknowledge that the situation was a major change in comparison to before the games so we believe the games had a good influence in that
7298568 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come true
7298569 we have inquired of the authorities who said the protests and the inquiries of the citizens have been met in mutual agreement that is my reply

7298591 what i would like to do for people is to present the life in christ as something that is accessible and as something that works so that all of the wonderful phraseology like you find in ephesians 4 galatians 5 colossians 3 1 corinthians 13 or matthew 5 doesnt just sit over there like a platonic form out of reach where youre just able to see enough of it to feel guilty it doesnt just have to do with forgiveness but more than anything it has to do with a relationship to real life

7298598 we pledged a clean team it appears weve done that
7298599 these games are significantly more competitive than those in athens
7298600 coming in we said that china was going to be a strong country and as the host expected a bump
7298601 you see that more in their gold medal count right now than maybe their total medal count for the increase theyve had from previous games
7298602 we dont gauge our performance strictly on the number of medals
7298603 weve been clean and drug free we could not be more proud of how this team has behaved and exhibited olympic ideals
7298604 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7298605 as the most intangible legacy but also a very important one is that through the games china as been scrutinized by the world
7298606 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe that this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7298607 we have politicians we have other ways to do that
7298608 i think the olympics are about brining people together our hearts go out to people in other countries who arent in the best situations but as an athlete we all have been focusing on performing to the best of our abilities and our next event

7298631 het is alleszins nog te vroeg om een doorgedreven analyse te maken dat doen we zeker de komende dagen globaal gezien hebben de belgische sporters te weinig medailles in de wacht gesleept
7298632 de gouden medaille van tia hellebaut en de zilveren van de vrouwen op de 4x100 meter zijn zeker schitterende medailles ze getuigen van wereldtop en daar mogen we best fier op zijn

7298634 in samenwerking met alle partners wil ik een duidelijk actieplan voor 2009 2012 opstellen met duidelijke doelstellingen voor onder meer de spelen van londen we moeten duidelijke keuzes maken en hard inzetten op de dingen waarin we geloven
7298635 het zoeken van sporttalent kost veel tijd in 2004 ben ik begonnen met het uittekenen van een vlaams topsportbeleid daarvoor bereikten we mooie resultaten in sommige sportdisciplines maar die waren eerder ge soleerd in 2004 hadden we 6 miljoen euro voor een topsportbeleid voor 2009 trekken we 22 miljoen euro uit
7298636 een totale balans van mijn topsportbeleid kunnen we pas na twaalf jaar dus in 2016 opmaken
7298637 en als de franse gemeenschap ook hard investeert in topsport kan belgi zelfs de top vijftien bereiken
7298638 ik ben super tevreden met deze zege het was een moeilijke rally en eerlijk af en toe hebben we wat geluk gehad op momenten dat we voluit in de aanval gingen maar na alle tegenslagen sinds het begin van het seizoen mag het ook al eens meezitten zaterdag kregen we een geweldige strijd met mijn teammaat nicolas vouilloz peugeot 207 s2000 jammer dat hij zondag snel technische problemen kreeg ik moest de wedstrijd dan controleren en dat is niet makkelijk ik had een ruime voorsprong en moest geconcentreerd blijven maar het lukte geweldig de volgende wedstrijd wordt in spanje gereden dat wordt een compleet nieuwe rally voor mij ik weet niet wat ik er moet van verwachten maar deze zege geeft me alvast veel vertrouwen voor het vervolg van het kampioenschap
7298639 ik had wat last van onderstuur slipte en gleed op een brug aan de kant van de co rijder de deur was beschadigd maar erger was dat de elektrische kabel van de starter was gebroken waardoor we niet meer konden starten het is moeilijk om zon wedstrijd te beginnen zonder enige vorm van voorbereiding de eerste vier klassementsritten heb ik echt gezwommen ik vond geen goede afstelling nadien ging het beter een testsessie organiseren bewijst dus wel degelijk zijn nut want dan ben je vanaf de eerste meters mee ik rij zeker nog de rally van san remo eind september en misschien de rally du valais eind oktober maar dan hopelijk wel met een goede voorbereiding

7298691 since its launch in 2003 easycatalog has been used to create catalogs brochures and price lists in over thirty countries around the world one of the biggest problems has always been how we import complex structured data thats stored in a relational database such as mysql this latest module overcomes this by allowing the user to reproduce their database structure in easycatalog and use that from within indesign

7298701 some people in this environment need excuses for their own performances and they look for someone to blame while there are others who want medals and they will sleep on a barbed wire fence they will eat rolled oats and they will bloody well perform because they are hungry
7298702 it is the best finish in 40 years but we do know we have a long way to go in terms of building for london
7298703 we think we can achieve six medals in london that will be our target we had 11 top 10 placings here that was 25 per cent of our team in the top 10 in the world
7298704 we need more communication from the hierarchy to the athletes so that the athletes can know what is going on that is one of the things that has been lacking
7298705 there needs to be a lot done to encourage younger athletes to stay in the sport and make it financially viable that they are staying in the sport

7298723 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months
7298724 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
7298725 the overall debt burden in the us economy is currently at record levels raising concerns that a recession if it occurs could set off a sharp downward spiral
7298726 the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959 the process is accelerating and will require the fed to slash rates at its september meeting
7298727 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
7298728 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
7298729 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
7298730 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
7298731 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight
7298732 the federal reserve definitely caused the great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933

7298742 the freedoms dangled before the unfree are in reality disguised power
7298743 when the nss document presents the free market as one of the three components of the ideal political system
7298744 the market is a surrogate a stand in for globalization empire
7298745 is taboo in u s political debate no major politician or party has so much as publicly remarked on the existence of an american empire
7298746 relies more on private media than on public agencies to disseminate propaganda reinforcing the official version of events
7298747 the democrats politics might be described as inauthentic opposition in the era of superpower having fended off its reformist elements and disclaimed the label of liberal the democratic party is trapped by new rules of the game which dictate that a party exists to win elections rather than to promote a vision of the good society accordingly the party competes for an apolitical segment of the electorate the undecided and puzzles how best to woo religious zealots should democrats somehow be elected corporate sponsors make it politically impossible for the new officeholders to alter significantly the direction of society at best democrats might repair some of the damage done to environmental safeguards or to medicare without substantially reversing the drift rightwards by offering palliatives a democratic administration contributes to plausible denial about the true nature of the system by fostering an illusion among the powerless classes that the party can make their interests a priority it pacifies and thereby defines the style of an opposition part in an inverted totalitarian system in the process it demonstrates the superior cost effectiveness of inverted totalitarianism over the crude classic versions
7298748 politics are the shadow cast on society by big business
7298749 the range of vision embraced by the primary contestants in the major u s parties has always been bounded by the horizons of property and enterprise they have accepted the economic virtues of capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man that culture has been intensely nationalistic
7298750 if political preferences are simply plugged into the system by leaders business or other in order to extract what they want from the system then the model of plebiscitary democracy is substantially equivalent to the model of totalitarian rule
7298751 america the greatest democracy that money can and did buy
7298752 guided one at its worst it is a corrupt farce amounting to manipulation with the larger population projects of propaganda in a controlled and trivialized electoral process it is an illusion
7298753 that real change can ever come from electing a different ruling class sponsored candidate
7298754 the truth is that in obama a worried establishment has found the vessel through which they hope to restore international and domestic stability
7298755 obama like carter can be useful to the u s power elite in calming things down and re establishing confidence in the legitimacy of the current political order in short he can reinforce the argument that the system still works

7298777 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7298778 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7298779 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7298780 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child

7298807 a solid choice that adds political savvy national security experience and a pit bull campaigner to obamas ticket
7298808 is one of congress most knowledgeable and respected voices on national security
7298809 brings far more to the ticket than foreign policy experience he has a powerful personal story and bidens record in the area of crime and the judiciary is another asset democrats can point to that will go beyond his foreign policy credentials

7298814 da gibt es nicht viel zu sagen ich bin zu fr h weggefahren das war mein fehler
7298815 hast du vor dem motorschaden schon irgendwelche warnzeichen gesp rt
7298816 nein erst in den letzten kurven ich wei nicht was passiert ist aber wir werden genau untersuchen was mit dem motor nicht gestimmt hat vielleicht war es ein hnliches problem wie bei felipe massa anm d red im letzten rennen das werden wir noch herausfinden
7298817 der speed war auch nicht optimal wo hat es gehapert
7298818 wir hatten nicht wirklich das qualifying das wir uns erhofft hatten daher starteten wir relativ weit hinten da kannst du nicht viel ausrichten es war ein wochenende das ich am besten schnell wieder vergesse aber im nachhinein ist es egal weil wir das rennen sowieso nicht beendet h tten das ist schade aber ich denke wir kennen unsere schw chen und k nnen sie hoffentlich ausmerzen
7298819 gut es war kein nettes wochenende denn wir haben auf den f hrenden in der weltmeisterschaft boden verloren aber wir haben noch eine chance den r ckstand wieder aufzuholen
7298820 vor dem wochenende warst du sehr optimistisch deine erwartungen haben sich nicht erf llt
7298821 wir sind nicht ins ziel gekommen und wir hatten auch nicht das qualifying das wir uns erhofft hatten wenn du hinter so vielen leuten stehst kannst du nat rlich nicht mehr viel machen der speed war im rennen nicht so schlecht aber das sieht man hinter einem anderen fahrzeug nicht dann hatten wir das problem beim boxenstopp das war egal denn wir w ren so oder so nicht ins ziel gekommen jetzt m ssen wir nach vorne schauen

7299059 i just threw everything i had he caught me with a couple of good shots i caught him body shots as well that probably didnt score
7299060 but im not going to start making excuses ive had a great campaign i want to thank all the supporters here and at home thats it thats the end of the fairytale for now
7299061 im happy im very very happy it would have been nice to take the gold its always the same when you win something you want more
7299062 he boxed well himself he had a hard draw himself he done well and beat the russian and kazakh you cant take it away from him he done it there tonight
7299063 a blind man could see that kenny scored four or five clean shots that he didnt get a couple of times zhang didnt have clean shots but he got them
7299064 at the end of the day he is going home with a silver medal we wanted gold but unfortunately it wasnt to be and he certainly has done his country proud
7299065 i am delighted to congratulate kenny egan on his outstanding achievement egan has crowned a distinguished boxing career with todays silver medal victory it is a proud day for our country and for irish sport
7299066 for irish boxers to win three olympic medals is really a stellar achievement and todays silver medal victory has further cemented boxings important position as an olympic sport and a key sport for ireland
7299067 as captain of his team kenny egan led from the front and set a superb example to the rest of the boxing team by applying his vast array of skills and experience to great effect

7299073 the boys ran a good race they ran a tough race bekele took charge he seems like he was having an easy day today
7299074 we spent all day yesterday watching videos of boonjomnong because we knew that there has to be an effective strategy to fight him
7299075 nobody else could find the right stratgey but i guess we did
7299076 i made history because im the second boxer in the history of the dominican republic to win a medal
7299077 this is so important for me but also for my country i dont have a coach i have a magician
7299078 i want to dedicate my victory to my parents my two little kids and to all the people in the dominican republic who have been watching my bouts at 3am in the morning every day just to support me
7299079 all my life ive been waiting for today i went through so much hurt so much but i have tried my hardest

7299082 i think for an hour today we were great we passed the ball real well and the travelling caught up with us the last half hour of the game the effort was phenomenal everybody kept going right to the end which is not surprisingly considering the players we have on the one hand were disappointed but on the other hand the effort was good we made chances we could of won the game we only have one fit striker at the present time but were travelling here there and everywhere and that takes it toll so were kind of happy to get something out of the game
7299083 we played well as a team its a hard place its a great place to play they get great fan support and its a great environment to play soccer tonight was one of those where we got the lead early and just couldnt hold on they kept pushing and attacking we created chances they created chances at the end of the day both teams did well for the point we could have got the 3 points late in the game its one of those where you take one point out and look forward to the next one
7299084 its tough man its a lot tougher than it looks its a tough place to play and its a good atmosphere you know we were fortunate to get that first goal and unfortunate to not score that goal in the 90th minute but we definitely absorbed some pressure there but well take a point up here because its a tough place to play
7299085 obviously were a little disappointed not getting the victory we definitely had the better run of play early on but to get a result on the road in a hostile place like this is big
7299086 i thought we deserved to get something more although we could have lost it near the end you know sutz sutton pulled off a great save julius james pulls off a fantastic block he does that every day in training so when he did it tonight i was pleased because that is as good as a goal what he did i thought it was a good game i thought the first half we gave away an unbelievable sloppy goal weve got three against one in the box the guy is put under no pressure twellman is a good striker and its in the back of the net
7299087 well he had one or two things to sort out obviously because he was away on international duty it was very difficult for him to get back into la to sort all that out but he is our player i know mos johnston made contact with him hes looking forward to coming he wished all the guys the best of luck tonight hell be with us hopefully monday and he cant wait to get going
7299088 it was just kind of a bang bang play from them they got a lucky deflection that was able to sneak through he ralston got a pretty good shot off and i got enough of a hand on it to put it wide of the post
7299089 we did more than enough to get the 3 points we had good chances we dominated and sutton really didnt have to do too much defensively we were pretty solid they get one chance and we make one mistake and its unlucky for the guys because we worked our tail off the whole game
7299090 no as i said before when i played my first game here i like the pressure you know i thrive on it i scored two goals in four games but i want to score four in four games i dont want to stop but with carlos up here hopefully he can bang some in too and we can get some wins

7299100 molto positiva da un punto di vista musicale e stato un stimolo che mi ha fatto veramente sentire coinvolto nella costruzione di qualcosa come fu la chiesa per eliot e che d il vero senso di appartenenza come io stesso lo sento non mi sono mai trovato in un periodo cos concreto come questo ci sono valori che condivido e che ho cercato di portare avanti in questa opera che stata davvero importante per me

7299105 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7299106 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

7299115 the federation and people in charge should put these boys together and take very good care of them because they are the future of the senior national team
7299116 they will come out in future to represent the country at the senior level and make nigeria proud as they have done here
7299117 it was a very difficult game both teams were a little bit tired because of the excessive heat
7299118 im guessing of the top players who could carry the game for us and for them didnt play to their level because of the heat
7299119 working for the weekend until our lungs hurt we then took an anticlimactic walk across the street to oil can harrys and spent about 10 minutes watching the gays stand model and endlessly search for the greener grass
7299120 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7299121 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7299122 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7299123 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7299124 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7299125 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7299132 africa is the centre of the world with a population of almost one billion while the middle east north african region has a population of 400 million we have all the ingredients to make this project a reality
7299133 the idea is to finance the project in progressive phases and implement it step by step
7299134 our aim is to increase our non aviation revenues and passenger numbers at klia through creation of activities in the long term we want to make klia an airport city
7299135 a master plan has been developed outlining development options and submitted to the sepang municipal council we expect it to be approved in two months
7299136 in the meantime we will continue to generate awareness of the project among developers and investors both locally and abroad
7299137 we will self develop some of the development components for long term recurring rental income
7299138 we wont invite just anybody the developers and investors must offer premium development properties in order to maintain the klia brand of modern and high technology facilities this must be carried out throughout the whole development
7299139 we will also invite developers and investors to submit a rfp to develop and operate a 40ha theme park a logistics centre and golf courses at the airport land
7299140 the advantages our location has are its proximity to the airport the abundance of land and the presence of a low cost terminal
7299141 for this area to be successful it must be well connected as such we are proposing a tram or train line to connect the commercial centre to the airport
7299142 we are studying what is best we have allocated some parcels of land for this transport centre
7299143 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7299144 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7299145 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7299146 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7299147 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7299148 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7299149 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7299150 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7299151 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7299152 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7299153 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7299154 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7299155 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7299156 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7299157 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7299158 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7299159 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7299160 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7299161 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7299162 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7299163 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7299164 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7299165 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7299166 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7299167 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7299168 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7299169 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7299170 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7299171 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7299172 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7299173 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7299174 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7299175 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7299176 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7299177 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7299178 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7299179 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7299180 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7299181 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7299182 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7299183 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7299184 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7299185 probably the most significant factor in this reevaluation has been the success of the surge in iraq
7299186 almost all the experts said it wouldnt work and it did work and the evidence is everywhere when a president is right and all of his critics are wrong sooner or later voters who are not hard partisans recognize that and give the president credit
7299187 the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream
7299188 in many cases the next president should follow rather than reverse them
7299189 i think were getting hints of the image rehabilitation that will inevitably come but it wont come until some time in the next presidency or two
7299190 it generally takes time for peoples partisan feelings to abate and for people to look back and take a fresh view of an old presidency
7299191 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7299192 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7299193 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7299194 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7299195 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7299196 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7299197 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7299198 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7299199 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7299200 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7299201 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7299202 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7299203 who are open to doing something on the production side
7299204 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7299205 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7299206 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7299207 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7299208 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7299209 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7299210 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7299211 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7299212 je crois que les gens se sont dit si ces gars ne sont pas capables de mener une convention sans se battre entre eux dans la rue et la convention comment pourraient ils diriger le pays
7299213 la derni re saison des primaires 2008 est le fruit direct de celle de 1968
7299214 si les dirigeants du parti avaient eu le dernier mot dans le choix du nomin cette ann e il est probable que nous aurions plut t que le jeune obama comme candidat
7299215 les repr sentants et les s nateurs ont vu la fa on dont les tudiants prenaient les rues et ils se sont dit quil valait mieux diriger cette nergie vers une participation la vie politique
7299216 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
7299217 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7299218 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7299219 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7299220 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7299221 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

7299252 the state has property that is unused that needs to be used as a railroad that was its intended purpose

7299255 the purpose is to restore blount street to a shadow of its former glory when it was nothing but a street of large historic homes
7299256 tell you the truth i think its a shame that theyre actually moving them
7299257 this is a pretty stretch of road and i hate that theyre actually moving the historical houses

7299263 one of the things weve had recently is a lot of swimming advisories out on the channel and they are due to a warm blooded bacteria
7299264 the contamination will either come from humans birds or other warm blooded animals and one source of that can be human obviously
7299265 this could contain pathogenic bacteria which are disease causing organisms that can cause people to get sick to have upset stomach diarrhea skin irritations eye irritations and all kinds of nasty things like that
7299266 with the last couple years with all the pollution that weve had in our creeks and waterways i think it is definitely good
7299267 it could take a few months or a few years
7299268 was a creation of the jihadist culture of the pakistani army

7299272 they the elderly couple were leaving the side road near the bp intending to turn right towards annandale outside the cluden racecourse
7299273 there was a car in front of him at the stop sign where roadworks are being undertaken
7299274 the car in front of him did a right hand turn and it would appear that the elderly driver didnt completely stop at the stop sign and hasnt seen the car coming from the right
7299275 unfortunately the landcruiser has t boned the car hitting directly where the elderly driver was sitting and he was killed instantly

7299277 this upgrade provides a whole new dimension to the civic theatre
7299278 the one very good thing is the provision for disabled access to the top level of the auditorium
7299279 now we have got approval we will be moving very quickly
7299280 we would be very keen to have it completed by july
7299281 if its done before the v8 supercars race it would be great
7299282 a middle sized theatre is still going to be a need
7299283 i would be trying to persuade them to do it earlier than 10 years
7299284 that opportunity has been set aside by the state government
7299285 were just simply surprised the government didnt allow the project to go through the normal processes
7299286 the environmental impact statement would have gone through state government and federal government checks
7299287 what was surprising was the sweeping nature of the decision
7299288 qer is currently reviewing the announcement by the queensland government in respect of development of the states oil shale resources
7299289 the company had no advance notice that the queensland government was considering taking the premature decision it has announced
7299290 i think it was too close to the coast and wetlands
7299291 it was also unproven technology there was no running example where you could touch it and see the impact

7299317 international laws and rules are unreliable defense and promotion of a liberal order still depend on the possession of military might
7299318 to initiate a war of aggression is a supreme international crime in that it contains the accumulated evil of the whole
7299319 rather remarkable truth is that the iraqis have made enormous strides towards liberal democracy
7299320 there are hopeful signs that the iraqis of differing religious ethnic and political persuasions can work together a far cry from the predictions before the war both here and in europe that a liberated iraq would fracture into feuding clans
7299321 obviously the administration intends to publicize all the weapons of mass destruction u s forces find and there will be plenty
7299322 the answer will have to be invasion not merely an air and missile strike to put an end to irans nuclear program as well as its regime
7299323 if the u s decides it must take strong action it will have an easier time showing that all other options were exhausted
7299324 i do not believe that anyone should make promises as a candidate for president that they cannot keep if elected
7299325 to promise a withdrawal of our forces from iraq regardless of the calamitous consequences to the iraqi people our most vital interests and the future of the middle east is the height of irresponsibility
7299326 its a failure of leadership to support an open ended occupation of iraq that has failed to press iraqs leaders to reconcile badly overstretched our military put a strain on our military families set back our ability to lead the world and made the american people less safe
7299327 these likely consequences of americas failure in iraq would almost certainly require us to return to iraq or draw us into a wider and far costlier war
7299328 the dramatic reduction in violence has opened the way for a return to something approaching normal political and economic life for the average iraqi
7299329 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life
7299330 john mccain impressed me as somebody who understood how the economy worked
7299331 i think that comment about not understanding economics which was made one time and blown totally out of proportion is frankly more a reflection of john mccains innate humility than anything else
7299332 when you think about how much this war has cost this country
7299333 how does the iraq war play into his economic goals
7299334 theres no question that the iraq war is costing us a lot of money
7299335 but its also the case that the housing crisis has nothing to do with the iraq war high fuel prices have nothing to do with the iraq war per se and high food prices in particular have nothing to do with the iraq war its not fair to try and make the iraq war the cause of our our current economic difficulties
7299336 when youre spending over 50 to fill up your car because the price of oil is four times what it was before iraq youre paying a price for this war when iraq is costing each household about 100 a month youre paying a price for this war
7299337 there is no job that is americas god given right any more
7299338 a year ago john mccain started calling for a substantial reform of unemployment insurance
7299339 he said we need to train people so they can compete we help them get back in the game by giving them the skills they need to compete for 21st century jobs
7299340 for the majority of americans who havent met any of the brave troops whove been cavalierly tossed into the quagmire
7299341 the war is out of sight and mind in a way vietnam never was
7299342 i think from the beginning the plan with this was was to kind of keep it out of sight and out of mind
7299343 it blew up and now people just dont want to deal with the mess
7299344 you look at the polls everybody wants us out of iraq
7299345 and yet john mccain trusted by 14 percent more people on the iraq war than clinton or obama thats just strange because hes so wrapped in this unpopular war
7299346 if the democrats are going to win theyre going to have to make the case how hes wrapped
7299347 the biggest thing is that we keep maintaining we have this functioning democratic government thats standing up troops the white house announces and mccain does too the iraqis are in the lead well theyre in the lead for about 10 minutes the british and the americans had to rescue them
7299348 theres a sense that the country feels that they went into it lightly and now no one knows what to make of it no one knows what victory is it seems the only things we can measure it by are either having a functioning government in iraq which we dont or bringing troops home which were not

7299464 over the course of the next few minutes the vehicle is seen a number of times in the neighbourhood by a number of police members and there are some attempts made to stop the vehicle
7299465 all this is subject to investigation but we know that our police member discharged a firearm at the driver of the vehicle the vehicle carried on for a short distance about a block and a 34 year old male was taken into custody and then immediately taken to hospital by ems for treatment of serious injuries

7299467 its an injury sustained in this incident but not firearm involved he wasnt shot
7299468 they may not have a complete picture of what occurred but they may be able to add a very pertinent piece of information
7299469 we need to do an investigation that looks into use of force by a police officer using a firearm that causes injury

7299484 the amendment will not produce bloodshed and suffering in iraq
7299485 more bloodshed and suffering than weve already seen which has been exacerbated by the failure of iraqs leaders to stop sectarian violence and produce a durable widely accepted political settlement
7299486 more than 4 million iraqis have already fled their homes for fear of sectarian violence at a rate now of 100 000 every month
7299487 ethnic cleansing is rampant and therefore we should encourage them to finish the job quickly

7299510 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7299511 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7299512 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7299513 theres a huge complementarity between the feds lender of last resort function and the intimate knowledge of financial institutions
7299514 the macroprudential supervisor would recognize that for the system as a whole excessively conservative lending policies could prove counterproductive if they contribute to a weaker economic and credit environment
7299515 in principle such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered and because activities or risk taking not permitted to regulated institutions have a way of migrating to other financial firms or markets

7299520 when she cried we all cried we felt we had put too much on pressure on her
7299521 she came second but in the eyes of australia shes a winner
7299522 her interview in the mixed zone afterwards was one of the most refreshing pieces of sports interviewing ive ever seen she was such a breath of fresh air we had a lot of fun with that story
7299523 while it has obviously been so successful for team gb i also love some of the stories that have come out of the other 200 countries here
7299524 it is important to remember there are places in the world suffering a lot of pain and thats the power of sport it does not solve problems but it can make you feel better
7299525 what moved me most was the attitude of this man the attitude to say this is a big failure i take responsibility but i will come back and i will win gold
7299526 the games is not only about winning its about the struggle of everyday athletes to reach his or her own limits
7299527 her father died while she was living in italy then her mother fell ill so she tried to get back to cuba to see her mother
7299528 they would not grant her a visa but in the end she got one but then on the plane home she got a text to say her mother had died
7299529 so she switched planes to meet up with her team mates and got to beijing in time to play at the olympics
7299530 its very gratifying to find out that were so popular in israel
7299531 were not the most fashionable unit touring out there in the world were not spring chickens but the shows were putting on are among the best weve ever done that filters around to fans they talk to each other on chats and websites and i think that our continued success has something to do with that
7299532 when roger and i play together its like second nature we dont even have to think about it when somethings about to happen we know about it even if we dont know exactly what it is thats going to happen sometimes its in relation to just one note and the way its played and you react immediately in the same way two musicians locking in
7299533 without ian deep purple is not the same its obvious that we were missing his singing and his demeanor on stage during ian s years away from the band when you go back to what created our megasuccess in the early 70s and if you keep the greater percentage of people involved in that process you can also keep the spirit of the music of that time so when you have three of us from that lineup its easy to continue getting the music to feel the way it should and play it the way it should be played
7299534 ich glaube h meine berater werden sich bei ihnen melden
7299535 we were just listening to each other smile on the phone
7299536 weve all gone through triumph and tragedy in the past four years and we saw one at the beginning of this tournament here
7299537 who knows why this guy did what he did if i spend time getting angry thats not really going to help me heal or help me support my wife or my family my job is to be there for them and to help everyone get through the grieving process i think if we sit around being angry at something thats already happened thats a waste of a lot of emotion
7299538 if you want to make a case for working hard and being good then take a look at our team were not the biggest guys were not the fastest and were not going to hit the hardest but when we come on the floor we bring it i just like our heart a lot
7299539 on the one hand im mourning the loss of my father in law
7299540 my heart aches for my wife and for our family on the other hand im extremely proud for my team for our organization for what weve been able to achieve over these four years those are the two emotions i have obviously theyre conflicted

7299545 somebody told me my first spring training one of my hitting coaches that that box is your office and you can do whatever you want with it so you mets sunday story time
7299546 that was most enjoyable my dear james you really ought to go on the halls now about that little problem of yours this business of not knowing good men from bad men and villains from heroes and so forth it is of course a difficult problem in the abstract the secret lies in personal experience whether youre a chinaman or an englishman
7299547 you admit that le chiffre did you personal evil and that you would kill him if he appeared in front of you now
7299548 well when you get back to london you will find there are other le chiffres seeking to destroy you and your friends and your country m will tell you about them and now that you have seen a really evil man you will know how evil they can be and you will go after them to destroy them in order to protect yourself and the people you love you wont wait or argue about it you know what they look like now and what they can do to people you may be a bit more choosy about the jobs you take on you may wnt to be certain that the atrget really is black but there are plenty of really black targets around theres still plenty for you to do and youll do it and when you fall in love and have a misress or a wife and children to look after it will seem all the easier
7299549 surround yourself with human beings my dear james they are easier to fight for than priciples
7299550 but dont let me down and become human yourself we would lose such a wonderful machine

7299558 on the one hand i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly and my heart aches for my wife and family and for the loss
7299559 my first emotion is shock said outside hitter reid priddy
7299560 this is extremely emotional for so many reasons weve all invested our lives in this sport and to hear our anthem played thats something you think about when youre 12 years old
7299561 this win doesnt bring back todd but they invested their lives in this too and i know theyre happy our prayers will continue to be with their family we know this is a bittersweet time were just happy to come out on top
7299562 from the first set everybody believed in it said u
7299563 we were making incredible plays its like the story came true it happened this is how it should end

7299591 right wing women have surveyed the world they find it a dangerous place they see that work subjects them to more danger from more men it increases the risk of sexual exploitation they see that creativity and originality in their kind are ridiculed they see women thrown out of the circle of male civilization for having ideas plans visions ambitions they see that traditional marriage means selling to one man not hundreds the better deal they see that the streets are cold and that the women on them are tired sick and bruised they see no way to make their bodies authentically their own and to survive in the world of men right wing women are not wrong their desperation is quiet they hide their bruises of body and heart they dress carefully and have good manners they suffer they love god they follow the rules they use sex and babies to stay valuable because they need a home food clothing they use the traditional intelligence of the female animal not human they do what they have to do to survive

7299612 oh great guruji ive tasted fame and fortune girls adore me but i still feel that theres something missing tell me what is the most important thing in life
7299613 how many commercials aimed at american youth even jokingly have the quest for the meaning of life as a plot device
7299614 you know im really too young to have an answer for that yet but i think its probably to be the best person you can be so that when youre dead and gone other people can say yeah he was a really good person
7299615 ill tell you what well waive that rule for you here if you can tell us who the jews are
7299616 its a surprise her daughter is turning 18 youd think she could have planned ahead
7299617 it wont be good for me or my neighbors or the bank or merced if i lose it yet thats where im headed its very frustrating
7299618 could have figured out that too much inventory and not enough bodies was a recipe for disaster
7299619 in four or five years when their credit is better and the market has recovered ill sell the house back to them
7299620 ill try my best to pay my mortgage but if not ill have no choice to leave like the other people
7299621 its her luck why would i be mad at her
7299622 there were supposed to be stores and a fire station over there
7299623 we could all march down to city hall and picket but whats really going to happen with that
7299624 i would never deny we all got greedy everyone was setting records nobody was there to take away the punch bowl
7299625 they swore they were going to live in the houses
7299626 property is unacceptable due to high foreclosure rate and volatility of subject market
7299627 if a few institutions take the position that prices in the central valley are still excessive and they need to wait to finance houses there youll have the total collapse of the market
7299628 we have to stop thinking that more growth is always the answer
7299629 we have more housing than we need we need jobs

7299632 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
7299633 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
7299634 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
7299635 why couldnt you have told me this either of the times weve been to walmart in the last three days
7299636 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7299637 hac an temer que la obra de auster estaba bajando
7299638 this is the final step for this four year period now our goal is to win the gold medal and to develop a program that other players want to be a part of for the next olympics
7299639 now we have to close the deal by winning that gold medal
7299640 the olympics opening ceremony was very dazzling showcasing the charisma of the chinese people the closing ceremony also has its own charm with its peacefull and joyful atmosphere
7299641 we took deep pride from providing service for the olympics
7299642 tears are coming to my eyes i dont want the games to end
7299643 i really wish that time could be back to 16 days ago
7299644 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7299645 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7299646 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7299647 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7299648 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7299649 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7299650 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7299651 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7299652 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7299653 lets throw a bunch of random words and images against the wall
7299654 if you test for the average youll get average results
7299655 id agree about the power of a b testing at the end of the day people get the best results from very small tests small tests make you focus multivariate tests can make you lose your focus
7299656 how to use plr properly to generate profits and traffic
7299657 such a lot of money on food borders on misdemeanour on governments part
7299658 we were never given more than a cup of tea at meetings how can the bill be so high
7299659 officials have no will to make it work and even the meetings which were very regular earlier have now become few and far between and any rwa member who does not turn up for two consecutive meetings has his her name struck off there has been no outcome at all and on hindsight i now feel that it was all a pr exercise at government expense a political stunt the rti figures only confirm my suspicion
7299660 a lot is talked about and the ground reality is not up to the mark and i had no inkling that such a lot of money is spent on these lunches and dinners if these figures are true then i am sorry this looks like yet another wastage of the tax payers money to further the governments image the money should have been used so much better for the development of colonies
7299661 we have never been given more than a cup of tea at the meetings how can the bill be so high anyway all bhagidari has attained is a hypothetical empowerment of rwas nothing more
7299662 highly justified each workshop lasts for three days it is common courtesy that you feed these people who have agreed to spare so much of their precious time for the community
7299663 the court has banned the bag at all places where it is used the most the only setback at this point appears to be the lack of a deadline for implementing the ban the government may take forever with this order
7299664 once the illegal units are shut what is to happen to all this waste
7299665 delhi pollution control committee does not have sufficient staff for such an operation
7299666 till some time back dpcc did not even have a clear idea of the extent of illegal plastic recycling taking place in the city the collection mechanism was based largely on ragpickers while the order is good for the city the government needs to plan out its course of action before implementing the order in a hurry
7299667 no problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it

7299878 with all the exposure that womens water polo got in these olympic games i think our sport will grow and especially grow outside of california to become a national sport i think there is still a lot to be done to offer things outside of college for women
