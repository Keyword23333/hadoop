6510196 the dc office cant run business after confiscating a business centre what will we do with that and we have stopped confiscating immovable property who will be responsible if any loss is occurred to the confiscated property and the convicted finally secure order through appeal from higher courts to get their property back
6510197 all the verdicts made by the special courts can be challenged or appealed against so the money confiscated so far is being deposited to a code so that it can be returned to the convicted once he she wins the appeal
6510198 if the government ultimately wins the confiscated property will be transferred to another code and become non returnable
6510199 fine or penalty should be ensured if contractor concerned failed to complete construction works by the deadline road repairing works should be done at night instead of daytime
6510200 the advantage of the deep sea platform is that it has a draught of more than 60 metres depth large ships carrying 100 000 to 200 000 tonnes of oil anchor near kutubdia such a volume of oil can be instantly unloaded to erl facility in the coast from the deep sea platform using a 40 60km underground pipeline
6510201 but the disadvantage is the high investment requirement the government has already been toying with this project for some time a public sector project has been cleared in principle by the planning ministry and forwarded to the economic relations division erd for funding but the funding has not yet been ensured
6510202 thats why at a meeting earlier this month it was suggested that this project be pursued on build operate transfer bot basis with private investment and that there be an alternative lower cost investment opportunity which is doable and realistic the bpc is looking into this matter now
6510203 sure this means a 200 000 tonne ship wont be able to avail the unloading facility but it would make way for large ships the length of the underground pipeline will be much shorter and therefore the cost will be much lower
6510204 but the point is this facility must be cost effective its easy to avail a finance of 100 million than 700 million
6510205 a person shall be disqualified for election as or for being a member of parliament if he has resigned or retired from the service of the republic or of any statutory public authority or of the defence service unless a period of three years has elapsed since the date of his resignation or retirement
6510206 notice of three months or more from the date of submitting nomination paper as a defaulter
6510207 the government neglects the institution and the bfa officials are just passing days as if spending leisure time they do not have any knowledge about films
6510208 the bfa preservers do not have any technical knowledge about film preservation they must know how to preserve film scientifically and fund crisis is another problem of our government
6510209 we have lost many of our documentaries and short films on the liberation war but i found a number of them well preserved in the archives of cbs in uk 10 years ago the films preserved there is very well arranged and scientifically maintained when i went there they asked me to have a cup of tea and produced a list of bangladeshi documentaries and short films they have preserved before i had finished my tea
6510210 preservers must be well trained and training must be arranged for them the bfa has become a neglected organisation of the country and you will not find an archive like ours anywhere on earth
6510211 the people working in film preservation are not film technicians the unskilled persons must be trained immediately and we also need budget for the bfa and it needs to be digitised like other film achieves of the world
6510212 an accurate temperature and humidity is required to ensure quality of films in preservation it cannot be ensured in a rented house the people working at the film archive are sincere but they need training and budget to carry out their duties
6510213 you must wear gloves before you touch a film we never allow touching films without wearing gloves but it is being done at bfa
6510214 who will take the risk of giving films only to be destroyed at the bfa moreover it costs tk 60 000 70 000 to make a print of a film and we have financial constraint it is difficult to give a print of a film for preservation immediately after its release a print of the film can be given six months after the film is released
6510215 due to the way the films are being so called preserved a number of them will be destroyed within 10 years while some will be ok for a little while more but the films will not be recoverable if the preservation procedures are not modernised immediately
6510216 if immediate steps are not taken to convert the films into digital format a few years later it would not be possible to convert those films
6510217 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6510218 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6510219 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify staying in the coalition
6510220 members belonging to our party in the parliament asked asif to become the next president
6510221 the provincial leaders unanimously recommended to the central executive committee that it should declare zardari as the party candidate for the office of the president
6510222 there was an understanding between the coalition partners that the presidential candidate would be decided by mutual consensus
6510223 during the meeting bilateral issues came up and both sides emphasised joint activities on the border to reduce trans border crimes
6510224 i have to leave the house before eid ul fitr

6510229 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defence
6510230 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6510231 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6510232 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behaviour in georgia
6510233 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
6510234 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
6510235 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
6510236 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
6510237 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
6510238 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

6510256 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6510257 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6510258 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6510259 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6510260 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6510261 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6510262 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6510263 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6510264 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6510265 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6510266 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6510267 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6510268 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6510269 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6510270 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6510271 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6510272 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6510273 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6510274 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6510275 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6510276 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6510277 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6510306 the more jobs created in milwaukee the more people will be employed and the increased the levels of production services and commodities will increase the state sales and income taxes respectively by sup porting that growth milwaukee will not only contribute more revenue to the budget but will also effectively increase its own portion of shared revenue through increased economic activity
6510307 seriously discuss a mass transit system that can bridge the employer employee gap in other areas
6510308 i believe we should fund those entities that are educating our children the issue is not choice vs public school the issue is educate vs incarcerate
6510309 i was raised pro life from the womb to the tomb
6510310 our location and the availability of a strong workforce are going to be the keys to our success we are perfectly poised to take advantage of the current energy crisis because of how our community is set up and our close proximity to downtown people are going to want to live here again we have to make sure that these changes benefit the people that live here now there will be good construction jobs and opportunities in retail and tourism and we need to take full advantage of these opportunities
6510311 army of volunteers help out in the schools to combat underfunding
6510312 we need to be very careful to make sure that this money is not mismanaged or that cur rent funding isnt altered to siphon money from these programs
6510313 i would like to uplift the people in the 16th assembly district and throughout the state
6510314 we as a state should work with businesses to stay or locate here health care is an issue that needs to be dealt with if a business has to pay too much for their employees they will leave or reduce their workforce
6510315 i have not seen any evidence that the school choice program has been successful i do not think it should be expanded we as a state should concentrate on public education
6510316 as milwaukees voice in the state assembly on many budget issues i worked hard last year to find 27 million in new funding to expand the sage program and 3 million to expand kindergarten pro grams for 4 year olds im especially proud of our work to support veterans with 32 million in new money to help our men and women in uniform pursue a higher educa tion degree after their service has ended i was able to bring much needed funding to milwaukee public schools in the form a new high poverty aid program authored by myself and sen lena taylor this pro gram brings an additional 17 million to mps and we were also successful in granting mps 10 million to fund more math and science programs
6510317 the assembly gop proved that they had no interest in fixing this funding flaw in fact when they wrote their version of the state budget they not only ignored the funding flaw they expanded the pro gram statewide thus i worked with sen lena taylor to create a plan that got an additional 27 million in funding for milwaukee public schools
6510318 i have worked with gov doyle to have this item placed in the state budget but it was pulled out by the assembly republicans
6510319 it is important for me to ensure that milwaukee gets its fair share of state funding in doing so i will establish close working relations with other lawmakers the working partnerships i will build will be built on common ground needs and free of antagonisms i will reach out to leg islators in order to develop efforts based on building alliances designed to move wisconsin forward by making milwaukee stronger and a better generator of revenue for partners outside of milwaukee
6510320 the choice program has shown itself to be just another experiment unable to break the bi products of poverty our educational system has pock ets of unique educational needs for the various populations of our state poor communities need more resources than rich districts

6510326 we are going to parliament to defend our mandate our problem is with the convening of parliament not the swearing in of members
6510327 we want cooperation and sharing of power not sharing of positions but sharing of power executive authority shared between the presidents office and the prime ministers office
6510328 there is one stumbling issue that we have been grappling with which is the framework of powers and roles of president and the new position of prime minister for the duration of transition leading up to two and a half years
6510329 that has been the crux and fundamental basis of this agreement thats why i think the kenyan experience becomes very important lesson to learn from

6510340 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

6510350 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6510351 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6510352 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6510353 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6510354 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6510355 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6510356 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

6510370 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6510371 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6510372 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6510373 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6510374 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6510375 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6510376 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6510377 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6510378 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6510379 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6510380 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6510381 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6510382 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6510383 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6510384 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6510385 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6510386 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6510387 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6510388 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6510389 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6510390 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6510391 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6510392 darken the cram with hard dated words i have to endure that this is it
6510393 stay with me please look it cant you read proteje damx mais san sez de vieux

6510396 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6510397 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6510398 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6510399 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

6510404 thanks to everyone who submitted questions to us all credit goes out to them but there are too many to mention
6510405 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6510406 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6510407 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6510408 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6510409 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6510410 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6510411 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6510412 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6510413 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6510414 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6510415 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6510416 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6510417 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6510418 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6510419 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6510420 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6510421 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6510422 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6510423 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6510424 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6510425 is a firefox extension which can add the same functionality to firefox statusbar

6510427 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6510428 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6510429 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6510430 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6510431 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6510432 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6510433 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6510434 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6510435 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6510436 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6510437 our new research reveals that cmdb deployments are at a fundamentally different stage than just two years ago as they move from the planning stage to value driven initiatives
6510438 we are a compassionate company that believes in giving back to the community so a portion of all proceeds will be donated to children charities in the respective countries
6510439 well be fine once the season starts i promise you once the preseason is over i think its almost like another switch is turned off and another one is turned on
6510440 well play however much coach phillips says we will play
6510441 obviously everybody wants to win the super bowl my goal is different my mentality is i want to win a super bowl but we cant win a super bowl without winning a playoff game so my thinking is lets win a playoff game
6510442 if you go back and watch that game i felt like i could have done more
6510443 as amas foram desenvolvidas por mim e pelo governador jos serra psdb evidente que se o ex governador geraldo alckmin quisesse ter feito alguma ama ele teria feito nos doze anos em que esteve frente do governo estadual
6510444 toda obra uma realiza o conjunta dos governos estadual e federal
6510445 eu tenho sempre reconhecido o governo estadual e o governo federal o papel importante que todos eles t m quantas realiza es importantes eu fiz com o presidente lula o importante mostrar o que o prefeito faz e eu fiz a minha parte

6510452 when we see that wounded traveler on the road to jericho
6510453 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6510454 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have different perspective
6510455 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccain s anytime anytime
6510456 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6510457 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6510458 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6510459 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6510460 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6510461 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6510462 i was inspired to race in mme this year because of two reasons
6510463 angeline i have been saying that i will loose weight since i was a little girl i am already 23 years old if i do not do this now i will never do it down the road when time has passed me by
6510464 the notification to other vets about the outbreak should have been more timely and accurate
6510465 i dont think theres anyone in the whole team who would have a bad word to say about him
6510466 he was easygoing obliging would never shirk what he had to do
6510467 since 1994 theres been a bit of an increasing incidence
6510468 every year we seem to be having one two or three outbreaks so the disturbing thing for me is does that mean its increasing in the flying fox population
6510469 as a result of climate change and environmental degradation were seeing wild animals brought into closer contact with domestic animals and humans and that will increase the spread of these diseases
6510470 im excited and honored to have this opportunity to show young people that suffer from any form of disability that with perseverance anything is achievable
6510471 i appreciate all the hard work bob babbitt from caf and competitor magazine has put into this along with my trainer david bailey
6510472 ricky has a gift and its easy to see whatever he wants to do he does
6510473 whether its figuring out a way to ride his motorcycle racing trucks or triathlons hes not scared i have no doubt he will finish ironman in his first attempt and thats saying a lot considering less than a year ago he had to learn all three disciplines from scratch
6510474 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6510475 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
6510476 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6510477 the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids
6510478 production of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid from biodiesel waste glycerol by microalgal fermentation agfd 272
6510479 wed characterize this influenza vaccine candidate as very promising based upon the immune responses and tolerability we saw in the clinical trial participants
6510480 utmb is committed to further studies of the vaccine candidate which has the potential to be a safe highly effective and much needed option to prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza a
6510481 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6510482 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6510483 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6510484 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6510485 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6510486 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6510487 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6510488 i have no doubt over the last eight weeks given some of the media articles we have suffered brand damage
6510489 that people read something and say this but a few days later they say well we understand that qantas has a great reputation
6510490 theres a perception now being created of a lot more problems with qantas than there is in reality
6510491 we undergo as an airline close to 150 audits a year
6510492 i have no doubt over the last eight weeks given some of the media articles we have suffered brand damage
6510493 i know we have because i amp squo ve seen the research
6510494 decided hes got to go all in on the black side
6510495 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6510496 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6510497 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to
6510498 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6510499 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6510500 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6510501 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6510502 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today

6510504 cooperation with nato is a complex issue and until russias political leaders have made a decision on what is involved the defense ministry has suspended military cooperation with the alliance
6510505 i think all major decisions on our cooperation with nato will be made during the consultations
6510506 were bringing the first entertainment district to this side of town
6510507 weve definitely have aimed high and felt like even in a bad economy really good projects that need to exist will do well and we definitely felt it was time for somebody to bring a project and product to eagle that was different
6510508 that is just a fantastically designed building that will obviously attract a number of other businesses that will want to co locate and create a very fun entertainment and boutique shopping district for this area
6510509 if you look at people coming from star or coming from emmett wheres the closest theater that they can get to right now especially for people in eagle the only theaters that are closer are in meridian or in boise
6510510 we have price points that will start as low as 160 000 which hasnt been seen in eagle with the amount of amenity and creativity weve brought to the area so we just felt like we put together a very good business plan based on the economy and we planned to have the time we need to be able to be successful in this area
6510511 its gonna be an awesome party with more than 7 things i like
6510512 its gonna be totally awesome i hope its a great time
6510513 i love roller coasters so this is my ultimate birthday

6510517 third point at least had nothing to do with bears demise the fund put on a large short bet on bear stearns in the summer of 2007 when the stock was in the triple digits and even reduced its prime brokerage exposure to the firm but after making a nice profit third point covered its bear trade later that year before the collapse that saw shareholders get just 10 a share for a stock that a year earlier was fetching 170

6510520 languages of the world this is an archive of over 1 500 human languages assembled in the year 02008 c e magnify 1 000 times to find over 13 000 pages of language documentation
6510521 this is one of the most fascinating objects on earth if we found one of these things 2 000 years ago with all the languages of the time it would be among our most priceless artifacts i feel a high responsibility for preserving it for future generations

6510533 were not going to let russia so soon after the iron curtain fell to again draw a dividing line across europe
6510534 the russians are hell bent on recapturing some of the territory that they believe is rightfully theirs that now is in the hands of people indigenous to the area who are embracing freedom and democracy
6510535 it would be great if the country said lets throw the bums out and i didnt have to campaign
6510536 we dont live in a flood zone but it just came in and came in and came in
6510537 the storm continues to be a threat to this community
6510538 is producing historic flooding across a large portion of brevard county
6510539 fay has and will continue to produce copious amounts of rain over a large portion of northeast florida as the storm turns westward on august 21

6510545 it doesnt matter if they were or werent involved in an attack today yesterday or on sept 11 2001 we seek out terrorists and we will give them the option to be captured or killed or possibly flee
6510546 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6510547 we have been quite satisfied with the performance of the field turf installations at our practice facility and at our former home the rca dome
6510548 i know our players are happy that we will continue to play on field turf at our new home at lucas oil stadium
6510549 after playing a preseason game on field turf against the seattle seahawks in 2002 our players asked if we could put it in at our practice facility
6510550 after practicing on it we put it in at the rca dome weve had great experience with field turf and are excited that it will continue to be our playing surface in the new lucas oil stadium
6510551 the advance buzz throughout the sports industry is off the charts for lucas oil stadium and the fact that fieldturf will be the official playing surface at this fantastic facility is quite an accomplishment for our product we are extremely confident that we manufacture the absolute best playing surface in the world today but it feels great to get this type of affirmation from the colts of course fieldturfs latest selection by the colts tells us that owner jim irsay president bill polian and head coach tony dungy along with the players and team staff have been very pleased with the performance of our product during the past three years that they played and practiced on fieldturf now the colts will have the state of the art version of fieldturf to go along with their state of the art stadium
6510552 but we are willing to collaborate with other nations when it comes to the misuse of bank secrecy laws for tax evasion
6510553 the time has come for us to base our system of mutual legal assistance and administrative assistance in tax matters on a new foundation

6510556 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6510557 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6510558 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6510559 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6510560 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6510561 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6510562 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6510563 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6510564 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6510565 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6510566 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6510567 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota

6510573 jimmy carters long history of anti israel bias has rendered him unfit to address the democratic convention it is incumbent upon the democratic party leadership and senator obama to remove carter from the program in denver the democratic party and senator obamas continued embrace of carter and his anti israel bias sends a troubling message to the jewish community it stands in stark contrast to the gop and john mccains pro israel stance
6510574 additionally senator obama should reject carters superdelegate vote the hand that shook khaled meshals should not be allowed to rise in support of senator obamas candidacy for president
6510575 hey you know who we should nominate some young black three year senator without a serious accomplishment to his name that has ties to terrorists and whose spiritual mentor hates america

6510591 eso es lo que le ha ocurrido hoy a la titular de fomento magdalena lvarez
6510592 a pesar de los esfuerzos de la conselleria de intentar convencernos de que es una medida favorable para todo el mundo
6510593 la excusa que puso la conselleria para que los establecimientos pudieran abrir fue que era muy conveniente que los parkings de las grandes superficies como aqua o el corte ingl s permanecieran abiertos para facilitar el aparcamiento a los asistentes al gran premio
6510594 lo que ocurre en esas grandes superficies es que para llegar hasta el parking hay que pasar obligatoriamente por las tiendas por lo que estos comercios quer an abrir

6510712 one hundred and forty tibetans are reported to have been killed but the figure needs to be confirmed
6510713 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital lhasa alone
6510714 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned

6510734 i dont think theres any firing offense for sununu but its a tough year for republicans
6510735 he is a very accomplished ambitious young legislator so its not that hes done a bad job
6510736 its just that his party is having a very tough time and he has a very strong opponent
6510737 in some ways mr sununu has got many things going for him except that he is a republican at a time when theres this shift and no one knows ultimately how strong this shift will be
6510738 but if were playing the guessing game than yeah this race leans democrat
6510739 if mr sununu is the beneficiary of what were seeing in the presidential race a trend for this race to be close and for states to vote along traditional lines he probably has a chance to take himself out of the most endangered category
6510740 theres no question jean shaheen will have the money she needs to be competitive in this race the democrats are going to make sure of that

6510760 shortly after the convention were going to have a come to jesus meeting to decide who are going to be the individuals to carry that message and carry obama around the state and around detroit

6510762 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with saddam there is one big difference he has used them not once but repeatedly i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
6510763 you allow someone like saddam hussein to get nuclear weapons ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons how many people is he going to kill with such weapons we are not going to allow him to succeed
6510764 threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its wmd programs
6510765 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
6510766 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
6510767 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
6510768 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
6510769 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
6510770 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
6510771 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
6510772 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
6510773 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
6510774 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam

6510779 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list

6510783 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6510784 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6510785 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6510786 the challenges we face today from saving our planet to ending poverty are simply too big for government to solve alone
6510787 if you get a federal grant you cant use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you cant discriminate against them or against the people you hire on the basis of their religion
6510788 federal dollars that go directly to churches temples and mosques can only be used on secular programs
6510789 for those of who us who believe in protecting the integrity of our religious institutions this is a fundamental right
6510790 return the law to what it was before the current administration
6510791 any religious organization that does not want to comply with that requirement simply doesnt have to take the money
6510792 if you cant hire people within your faith community than youve lost the distinctive that is the reason why faith based programs exist in the first place
6510793 disagrees with sen obama that hiring at faith based groups should be subject to government oversight
6510794 wants a faith based program thats even better than the bush program
6510795 his plan reminds me of much that was best in both then vice president al gores and then texas gov george w bushs respective first speeches on the subject in 1999
6510796 especially in urban america all the empirical evidence continues to show that local faith based organizations can make a measurable civic difference
6510797 i am disappointed that any presidential candidate would want to continue a failed policy of the bush administration it ought to be shut down not continued
6510798 i didnt grow up in a particularly religious household but my experience in chicago showed me how faith and values could be an anchor in my life and an anchor in the community
6510799 while i could sit in church and pray all i want i wouldnt be fulfilling gods will unless i went out and did the lords work
6510800 i think it is a bold smart engaging attempt to use religious organizations to help the poor and to do for the faith community what the bush administration could not
6510801 but im concerned that his position on hiring rights will bog down this initiative just like bushs position on the other side did the same thing
6510802 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6510803 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6510804 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6510805 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6510806 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6510807 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6510808 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6510809 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6510810 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6510811 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6510812 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6510813 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6510814 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6510815 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6510816 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6510817 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory

6510819 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6510820 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6510821 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6510822 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6510823 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6510824 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6510825 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6510826 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6510827 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6510828 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6510829 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6510830 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6510831 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6510832 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6510833 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6510834 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6510835 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6510836 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6510837 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6510838 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6510839 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6510840 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6510841 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6510842 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6510843 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6510844 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6510845 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6510846 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6510847 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6510848 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6510849 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6510850 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6510851 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6510852 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6510853 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6510854 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6510855 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this

6510859 i understand that sen mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and
6510860 more zombies on screen than you can shoot in a second
6510861 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6510862 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6510863 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6510864 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6510865 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip
6510866 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6510867 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6510868 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6510869 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6510870 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6510871 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6510872 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6510873 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6510874 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6510875 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6510876 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6510877 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care

6510897 the truly great and fun part of these jazz musicians is that they can interact with the audience something youll never get from the cd
6510898 tengo tanto que contar que me encantar a poder compartirlo y ayudar a tanta gente que se siente confundida por este tema
6510899 somos los pap s de valentina queremos compartir con todos nuestra experiencia y construir caminos y puentes que achiquen las diferencias
6510900 porque son muchas las personas que quieren saber de santi de sus logros de las cosas que nos pasan
6510901 llev mi angel sin voz mara cuenta en su blog la experiencia de educar a su nico hijo de 4 a os diagnosticado hace 3 con autismo
6510902 there was an altercation involving an unknown male who obviously threw something through a window
6510903 there was a smash it the object must have been alight because it ignited the curtains and the house went up
6510904 i was there eight minutes later and it was just destroyed
6510905 through their heroics they entered there and retrieved one male who was nearly unconscious he was unable to get out on his own
6510906 they went back in to retrieve the woman couldnt find her and they found she gained access to the rear of the premises and was in the back yard
6510907 we wont know what he threw through the window until the forensics get there we dont know if he had some sort of accelerant or if things just went up themselves
6510908 it was the american colonels even more than the generals who were asking for more troops
6510909 we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight we know we can win it
6510910 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6510911 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6510912 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6510913 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6510914 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6510915 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6510916 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6510917 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6510918 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6510921 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6510922 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6510923 how many are worse off than you were since george bush took office that describes the reality of our politics over the last eight years
6510924 and that is the reason i am running for president of the united states of america because i want to make sure that the next generation here in martinsville here in henry county here in virginia here in the united states of america has the jobs and the opportunity of the future
6510925 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he is opposed to new drilling at home and he is opposed to nuclear power
6510926 my friends we have to have nuclear power nuclear power has got to be part of any way of us being energy independent
6510927 the bottom line i think at this stage is too close to call
6510928 we do not know who is going to win but i think we certainly know the myth that obama is going to ascend uncontested to the presidency through adulation and grace and successful oratory is certainly not the case
6510929 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6510930 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6510931 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6510932 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6510933 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6510934 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6510935 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6510936 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6510937 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6510938 we decided to pick him up in an ambulance out of consideration for his health
6510939 he will be well taken care of by the prison hospital
6510940 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6510941 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6510942 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6510943 the guards suspected the animal might be involved in drug smuggling once they noticed four prisoners visibly intoxicated shortly after the pigeon landed on a prison window
6510944 we suspect that the pigeon carried the drugs from tuzla
6510945 we do not know what to do with the pigeon but for the time being it will remain behind bars
6510946 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6510947 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6510948 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6510949 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6510950 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6510951 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6510952 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6510953 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6510954 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6510955 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6510956 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6510957 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6510958 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6510959 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6510960 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6510961 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6510962 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6510963 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6510964 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6510965 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6510966 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6510967 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6510968 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6510969 the appointment is not a political compensation lien is an expert in finance and has been offered major positions in banks he doesnt need any political compensations
6510970 my job is to fulfill my responsibility and i dont want people to associate my position with politics
6510971 sean lien was given the position because he is the son of lien chan and because he is a promising star in the kmt
6510972 how can he lead the company without administrative experience and expertise in the transportation field
6510973 prosecutors still need some time to figure out where the stolen money nt 1 billion us 33 million is but we will wrap up our investigation and indict wu in the near future
6510974 the government of the republic of china strongly opposes any conduct that damages social morals and abuses the freedom of international financial transactions
6510975 the government of the republic of china strongly opposes any conduct that damages social morals and abuses the freedom of international financial transactions president ma ying jeou has repeatedly stressed that even the head of state is not above the law
6510976 to make taiwans democratic system more complete both the ruling and the opposition parties have agreed to list an unaccountable asset act as a priority item in the next legislative session
6510977 to establish a clean government is never a slogan but a contract we have signed with the public we have to make the government come out on top in terms of integrity and transparency and make people proud of the government they elected
6510978 jurispudence is the last line of defense for social equality and justice anyone who violates the law will be subject to justice regardless of their social status or party affiliation
6510979 the tension across the taiwan strait could be relaxed and so could the tension between political camps in taiwan
6510980 this is because we are still negotiating the arms procurement deal with the us
6510981 we write the budget to reflect reality but for confidentiality reasons i cannot provide details
6510982 the increased spending will focus on education technology culture the economy and benefits for the poor
6510983 since the two statutes are still before the legislature and the legislature attached a resolution on the passed 2008 budget request that required funds earmarked for the hall be written under the name of chiang kai shek memorial hall the government decided to withdraw the two statutes
6510984 the name of the hall will be changed back to chiang kai shek memorial hall because the name change of the taiwan democracy memorial hall was never legitimized
6510985 as for the rest of the issue we will have to reach a public consensus through public forums
6510986 despite easing cross strait tensions no artillery bombardment does not mean there is no war
6510987 improved cross strait ties do not mean we can let our guard down
6510988 despite the recent improvement in cross strait relations we should never forget 823
6510989 we dont want to see the same thing happen to our children
6510990 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6510991 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future
6510992 best recruiting sergeant that the new anti americanism could have hoped for
6510993 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6510994 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6510995 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6510996 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6510997 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6510998 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6510999 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6511000 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6511001 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6511002 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6511003 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6511004 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6511005 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6511006 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6511007 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6511008 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6511009 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6511010 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one

6511018 que alemania haya elegido a la planta brasile a de juiz de fora es una excelente noticia para brasil pero tambi n para toda la regi n esa planta es un ejemplo de tecnolog a y niveles de calidad para todo el mercosur
6511019 por el momento el clc sportcoup no puede ser comecializado con los aranceles del mercosur porque no cumple con el porcentaje m nimo de componentes de origen local la mayor a de las piezas vienen de alemania pero nuestros colegas brasile os se pusieron unas metas muy ambiciosas para aumentar cada vez m s la integraci n regional de componentes y dicen que en dos a os estar an en condiciones de que el clc califique como un auto del mercosur
6511020 mercedes benz de brasil ya hizo una experiencia similar con el clase a hace algunos a os fue un producto excelente y con una calidad muy superior a la media de la poca pero en brasil nunca se alcanzaron los objetivos de venta que se hab an propuesto en la argentina en cambio el clase a fue un xito
6511021 no s si el clc ser a el auto m s indicado para la regi n pero sin dudas el esfuerzo de la planta de juiz de fora es un gran avance para volver a contar con un auto mercedes benz producido en la regi n y que se pueda vender con los aranceles del mercosur
6511022 en nuestra planta de gonz lez cat n no hay posibilidades de que se pueda dar un caso similar al del clc en brasil porque nosotros dependemos de la divisi n vans de mercedes benz nuestro objetivo es y ser producir veh culos comerciales para todo el mundo actualmente producimos la sprinter para el mercado local y otros pa ses emergentes mientras que para europa y ocean a producimos la nueva generaci n sprinter que se lanzar en nuestro mercado de aqu a dos a os m s o menos
6511023 en lo que resta del 2008 no habr muchas m s novedades con la excepci n del lanzamiento del glk nuestra gran apuesta del a o fue el lanzamiento de la l nea amg y los resultados ya est n a la vista creo que vamos a cerrar el per odo superando las 50 unidades vendidas que nos hab amos propuesto los amg son veh culos de nicho para un p blico muy exigente pero su imagen ayuda a elevar el nivel de percepci n de toda la gama mercedes benz
6511024 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6511025 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6511026 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6511027 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6511028 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6511029 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6511030 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6511031 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6511032 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6511033 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6511034 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6511035 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6511036 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6511037 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6511038 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6511039 earlier last week the doh received a report from a local hospital when a couple was diagnosed with dengue fever after an expanded examination we found eight of their neighbors to also be infected while another case was found at a hospital this brought the total number of cases to 11
6511040 since shezidao is next to a biking trail adjacent to the tamsui and keelung rivers many people go there to exercise by biking walking jogging or doing tai chi
6511041 preliminary evaluations revealed that the viral strain is the same as those found in cambodia and vietnam we will investigate whether someone in the neighborhood had traveled there recently as the virus may have been imported
6511042 as we have not found aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the region the epidemic control remains promising
6511043 one of the main reasons why dengue fever is rarely seen in northern taiwan is that aedes aegypti do not typically survive north of the tropic of cancer
6511044 while female aedes aegypti can bite several humans or other mammals for blood to sustain their pregnancies aedes albopictus takes longer draws of blood from one or two individuals as such the disease distributed by the latter mosquito would see a smaller spread
6511045 examine the fundamental rights of the 23 million people of the republic of china taiwan to participate meaningfully in the activities of the un specialized agencies
6511046 of course we understand the chances of taiwans proposal being adopted this year are extremely low but our approach meets the expectations of the international community including major players such as the united states and the eu
6511047 china is probably still too busy with the olympic games
6511048 china knows it must weigh its moves carefully so it wont appear be too hostile to avoid the risk of increasing support for taiwanese independence
6511049 we have jumped from one extreme to another extreme but neither method will convince the general assembly to include the taiwan issue on their agenda
6511050 despite our less confrontational approach this year beijing still wont let taiwans bid go through
6511051 will the committee resort again to its usual two plus two debate format or will more countries speak up for taiwan countries such as the us members of the eu canada japan and australia will not support taiwan to join the un but would they at least speak on taiwans need to participate in the international community
6511052 it would be justifiable to interpret it as meaning that beijing does not care for the diplomatic truce that president ma ying jeou has initiated
6511053 taiwan is retreating now in order to advance later but if beijing still blocks taiwans observership bid at the next world health assembly in may then we can take it that china has no interest in extending goodwill to taiwan on the diplomatic front
6511054 the integration of asean will begin in 2010 with china joining the organization that year after chinas participation about 7 000 products will be able to enjoy duty free treatment within asean member states
6511055 japan and south korea will also join the organization after china the republic of china which is closely connected with all the member states of asean in terms of trade and economy should not be excluded from the organization
6511056 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6511057 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6511058 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6511059 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6511060 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6511061 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6511062 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6511063 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6511064 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6511065 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6511066 wir hoffen dass verschiedene l nder hier konkrete vorschl ge vorlegen wie diese drei anliegen konstruktiv kombiniert werden k nnen
6511067 die eu hat bereits konstruktive vorschl ge f r wichtige prinzipien vorgelegt andere industrie aber auch schwellenl nder m ssen jetzt nachlegen
6511068 wenn das energie und verkehrssystem weltweit z gig umgebaut wird und zugleich die w lder gesch tzt werden
6511069 wir brauchen dringend eine finanzierung von wirkungsvollem w lderschutz aber der notwendige w lderschutz darf nicht gegen die reduktionsziele der industriel nder gegengerechnet werden sonst bedeuten sie das aus f r die notwendige energie und verkehrswende der neubau von kraftwerken w rde uns weltweit langfristig auf einen pfad hoher emissionen einzementieren
6511070 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6511071 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6511072 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6511073 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
6511074 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6511075 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6511076 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6511077 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6511078 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6511079 the pleasure of love lasts but a moment the pain of love lasts a lifetime
6511080 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6511081 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6511082 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6511083 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6511084 empfehlungen f r die n chste regierung zu formulieren wie amerikanische interessen in der beziehung mit russland zu f rdern sind
6511085 wir leben wie obdachlose und die leben wie k nige
6511086 mit der bev lkerung dort wird es keine probleme geben wenn erstmal die russen weg sind
6511087 aber was sollten wir sonst machen wir sind vier millionen die russen sind 150 millionen
6511088 sp ter haben die sich einfach abgesetzt und uns allein gelassen
6511089 denn gegen russland kann man nicht siegen man muss mit russland irgendwie auskommen wir k nnen georgien schlie lich nicht nach amerika verlegen
6511090 wir laufen hier wie die affen herum wir k nnen uns noch nicht einmal rasieren
6511091 wozu brauchen wir krieg wir wollten auch dass der waffenstillstand unterschrieben wird
6511092 nat rlich w re es sch ner wenn ich ohne waffe nur mit meiner frau und meinen beiden kindern gekommen w re
6511093 die luft hat stets f r alle gereicht aber wohl nicht der verstand
6511094 ich respektiere dass auch russland seine nationalen interessen verfolgt wie das die bundesrepublik nicht anders tut
6511095 more than 5 6 million votes were cast for 70 world class cities which determined 20 of the 22 cities featured in the game
6511096 i voted every day myself and asked as many people as i could to vote for taipei
6511097 i hope that more people learn about taipei and become interested in the city through playing monopoly and with their interest in taipei id hope they would want to know more about taiwan
6511098 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6511099 hes taken a really serious turn for the worse just now
6511100 the vets have had a look theyve said hes having breathing difficulties his flippers are at an unusual angle hes not going to last much longer you should put him down
6511101 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6511102 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6511103 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6511104 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6511105 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6511106 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6511107 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6511108 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside
6511109 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6511110 cancelation of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain moa ad is a painful step
6511111 the administration is sensitive to public sentiments and the president is also committed to upholding the constitution
6511112 in doing so she will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law set within the constitution
6511113 the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6511114 the dead included women and children as most of the fatalities occurred due to the incidents of houses collapsing
6511115 two girls were buried alive as their mud house fell on them
6511116 a similar pressure area exists over the bay of bengal under these circumstances heavy rains are expected in next couple of days
6511117 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6511118 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6511119 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6511120 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6511121 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6511122 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6511123 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6511124 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6511125 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6511126 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6511127 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6511128 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6511129 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6511130 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6511131 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6511132 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6511133 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6511134 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6511135 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6511136 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6511137 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6511138 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6511139 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6511140 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6511141 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6511142 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6511143 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6511144 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6511145 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6511146 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6511147 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6511148 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6511149 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6511150 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6511151 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6511152 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6511153 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6511154 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6511155 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6511156 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6511157 its a bird its a plane its a woman who looks suspiciously disheveled bumming at the speed of light
6511158 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
6511159 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
6511160 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6511161 04 tammy cochran what i learned from loving you mp3
6511162 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6511163 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6511164 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6511165 they told me there are going to be resources here
6511166 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6511167 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6511168 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6511169 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6511170 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6511171 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6511172 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6511173 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6511174 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6511175 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6511176 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6511177 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6511178 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6511179 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6511180 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6511181 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6511182 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6511183 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6511184 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6511185 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6511186 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6511187 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6511188 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6511189 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6511190 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6511191 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6511192 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6511193 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6511194 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6511195 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6511196 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6511197 if those figures were accurate there needs to be mass graves where are those graves
6511198 we are saying that we will not hand over any sudanese citizens to anyone for prosecution abroad
6511199 we are an independent state with an independent and fair judiciary system
6511200 the next year after completing the election law well have free elections
6511201 some forces who are targeting sudans resources are encouraging fighting in sudan and want her to be divided
6511202 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them just made them go with the action urgently
6511203 if he mugabe goes further and appoints a cabinet it will be against the letter and spirit of the mou
6511204 we are no longer in the age of land art
6511205 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6511206 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernized in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6511207 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favor and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs
6511208 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6511209 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6511210 missile defense of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6511211 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6511212 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6511213 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6511214 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6511215 works of a renaissance master the prints of albrecht d rer
6511216 the man who virtually invented the photojournalistic motion picture still
6511217 but at this point id rather gaze at the empire state building for eight hours than see another biopic or documentary that claims to recreate the strange and mysterious world of his new york studio
6511218 the chelsea apartments were built in downtown victoria in 1977 as social housing but were sold to a private owner who has retained the property to the present within three years
6511219 many homeless people live in the vicinity and use the chelseas parking lot as shelter and or as a place to use drugs
6511220 none of the participants in chelsea girls 2008 were particularly interested in self exposure for its own sake
6511221 were raw in some positions but it was a good test
6511222 we saw what we need to work on and what we did well
6511223 siamo alle solite come sulle questioni economiche e sociali anche in tema di giustizia berlusconi e il centrodestra non si curano degli interessi di tutti i cittadini che sono quelli di
6511224 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now
6511225 it is the responsibility of thai airways to take him out of the country
6511226 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world the changes im announcing today will strengthen that even further
6511227 it makes you sick he should go and live on a desert island nobody wants him
6511228 he wont be getting a pint in here we have children coming in with their parents you cant be too careful
6511229 the key is to purge the police there are some police officers who wouldnt even pass a drug test
6511230 units of the follow up forces which were earlier brought into the conflict zone are being pulled back now
6511231 the man who virtually invented the photojournalistic motion picture still
6511232 develops and commercializes geothermal technology to produce clean renewable power

6511237 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6511238 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6511239 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6511240 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6511241 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6511242 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6511243 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6511244 eu gostaria de ter ficado nua dos 12 aos 28 anos eu estava tima

6511246 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6511247 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6511248 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6511249 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four

6511254 i did an absolutely beautiful job up there and nothing went missing i dont go to houses thinking i could get 100 for that tv because thats a part of my life thats gone
6511255 prince charles has talked of offenders being given a second chance now its his chance to give me one

6511257 after serving two thirds of his sentence mark scott crossley will be a free man by lunch time tomorrow
6511258 more than 36 000 enemy soldiers have already been killed
6511259 if history is a guide the u s economy is probably at the brink of a turning point in inflation
6511260 this is entirely conceivable given the projection of weak economic conditions in the near term inflation expectations as measured by the difference in nominal 10 year u s treasury note yield and the 10 year tip yield as of august 19 stood at 2 15 down from 2 57 on july 3
6511261 the main conclusion is that both core price measures core cpi and core personal consumption expenditure price index peak several months after the peak of the business cycle
6511262 ich erwarte dass wir gemeinsam auf die probleme der menschen gucken
6511263 durch diesen gemeinsamen schritt von mlp und bedeutenden produktpartnern sichern wir dauerhaft das gesch ftsmodell als unabh ngiger makler
6511264 es la forma m s directa de acceder al centro pero es demasiado larga para cualquiera por eso hemos pedido a la municipalidad que construya un funicular que la reemplace
6511265 esta escalera la usan a diario todos los residentes pero obviamente para los adultos y m s ancianos es un acceso muy dificultoso a eso se le suma que es muy oscura y en la noche se re nen j venes a consumir alcohol lo cual ha provocado situaciones delictuales
6511266 no hay recursos humanos ni presupuesto para hacer inspecciones peri dicas ya que stas deben hacerse cada d a para que sean efectivas y no tenemos un ej rcito de inspectores para realizar esas tareas
6511267 no son inspectores t cnicos sino que est n encargados de velar por el cumplimiento de las normas urban sticas y los planos reguladores
6511268 al momento de la recepci n final del edificio o condominio el director de obras se focalizar en materias urbanas que son de su directa competencia en la recepci n final no se pueden advertir problemas del hormig n o de la impermeabilidad de los materiales adem s la gran mayor a de las deficiencias aparecen despu s de que el comprador recibe el inmueble
6511269 ahora la responsabilidad es clara y es de la empresa que vende el proyecto
6511270 no sirve de nada ampliar los plazos de garant a porque las inmobiliarias argumentan en los juicios que las fallas se deben a falta de mantenci n de hecho en los ltimos a os se ha masificado la entrega de manuales de mantenimiento a los propietarios con eso se protegen
6511271 es casi imposible cobrar las indemnizaciones porque las empresas operan a trav s de sociedades que parten con un capital m nimo cuando empiezan a construir aumentan explosivamente sus fondos y luego al cabo de los cinco a os que dura un juicio vuelven a presentar un capital peque o y casi sin bienes
6511272 la responsabilidad legal no caduca porque la empresa cambie de nombre o de giro son las personas que est n detr s las que responden incluso con sus patrimonios personales
6511273 el minvu est trabajando en entidades certificadoras de calidad que si bien no ser n obligatorias dar n m s confianza a las empresas y a las personas
6511274 una forma podr a ser que los permisos de edificaci n que pagan las empresas inmobiliarias sean destinados a mejorar el presupuesto de las direcciones
6511275 debieran crearse seguros obligatorios a la calidad de la construcci n tal como existen en espa a y estados unidos para que el comprador afectado reciba una indemnizaci n m s r pido y no despu s de cinco a os de juicio contra la empresa porque se entender directamente con la compa a de seguros
6511276 vamos a crear la asociaci n de consumidores inmobiliarios para agrupar a todas las v ctimas de estos problemas
6511277 la gente debe informarse a fondo y exigir sus derechos tienen que ser m s rigurosos con las empresas hay que tener en cuenta que el mercado es imperfecto porque no todos los compradores tienen acceso a la misma informaci n
6511278 la legislaci n permit a mayor fiscalizaci n en el rubro inmobiliario incluso revisiones por etapas pero todo eso cambi hace muchos a os es dif cil que las direcciones de obras volvamos a lo que ramos antes porque casi todo ha quedado en manos de las empresas
6511279 the end state requirements are not known at program initiation
6511280 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6511281 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6511282 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6511283 to me hes ridden the change horse this far in politics and if im him i dont want to get off that horse and i dont worry about shoring up my foreign policy credentials i worry about projecting an image of change
6511284 this agreement further solidifies the great relationship we have with major league baseball and together with our television deal allows us to bring the game of baseball to more fans than ever before
6511285 wir versuchen einen ausgleich zu finden zwischen dem wunsch des iraks nach einem konkreten abbau der us truppenst rke ber die jahre und unserem wunsch dass dies von der jeweiligen lage vor ort abh ngig gemacht wird
6511286 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6511287 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6511288 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6511289 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6511290 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6511291 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6511292 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6511293 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6511294 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6511295 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6511296 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6511297 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6511298 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6511299 money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations an effect that is still apparent in peoples responses today
6511300 money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations an effect that is still apparent in peoples responses today
6511301 they act as if we were also celebrating this circus and at the same time they arrest our people at home they say they are traitors
6511302 now during the games they are really afraid and we get to feel that
6511303 but that does not give them the right to treat us all like criminals
6511304 it is stupid to be against the games what does that help
6511305 i live in lanzhou and the people enjoy the games they like my t shirt so why not
6511306 i know that at home in xinjiang there are many people who would fight for the regions freedom
6511307 that will not happen xinjiang is too important for china and the chinese army too powerful
6511308 the uighurs are not organized well enough for that and too smart i hope it is difficult enough as it is
6511309 the penetrating power of the military and the regional security forces is too big they have everything under control
6511310 didnt former premier su tseng chang receive funds didnt former dpp presidential nominee frank hsieh they the kmt want to fight our family to death then ill speak out and end my life my whole family has to die to show our innocence
6511311 ripe with intrigue an extremely well drawn well crafted comic
6511312 in the end it comes down to whether or not mccain or obama can captivate colorados palate through relative fiscal conservatism social moderation with just a splash of populism and energy and environmentalism talk for flavor
6511313 aunque me sorprende la noticia no es de extra ar porque beto alberto arvelo no es un director que trabaja para satisfacci n personal sino que quiere compartir con el mundo sus proyectos y lo que se hace en venezuela y latinoam rica es una gran pel cula porque cuenta con un excelente equipo de producci n que logr que la gente del barrio donde se rod participara no s lo en la log stica sino que tambi n aparece en las escenas se muestra c mo es el lugar en su realidad y se lograron unos planos muy buenos de la ciudad
6511314 although i am surprised the news it is not surprising because beto alberto arvelo is not a director who works for personal satisfaction but wants to share with the world their projects and what is done in venezuela and latin america its a great movie because it has an excellent production team that achieved that people in the neighborhood where he filmed participate not only in logistics but also appears in scenes it shows how the place is their reality and achieved some very good maps of the city

6511316 as campanhas de barack obama e john mccain acordaram participar de tr s debates presidenciais e um vice presidencial em setembro e outubro ambos patrocinados pela comiss o para os debates presidenciais
6511317 i have no uhh control in my grasping in either hand i have bilateral carpal tunnel ive had carpal tunnel release performed three times on both sides with no results
6511318 my right leg is always numb as if its you know the feeling that you get when and arm or a leg falls asleep from cutting off circulation
6511319 even if the scam fails larry has something to fall back on
6511320 um neg cio arriscad ssimo explorar no pr sal exige muito investimento e s compensa agora porque o pre o do petr leo est muito alto a coisa pode virar e se elevar o gasto p blico apostando em receita futura tem o risco de regress o
6511321 explorar o pr sal demanda investimentos elevados o que o governo n o tem
6511322 no auge dos ltimos meses a empresa chegou a ser a sexta maior no ranking das maiores petroleiras do mundo hoje a d cima primeira
6511323 im honored to do anything to help him win but the state and the budget are most important
6511324 because it shows the mccain campaign knows this is not about the base of the party but reaching the middle where the votes are
6511325 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6511326 muitas pessoas ficaram feridas e acredita se que o n mero de v timas fatais ir subir
6511327 isso quase o que gastamos com a cidade da m sica

6511330 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6511331 esque a o moroni das campanhas passadas hoje temos um novo moroni mais tranq ilo seguro consistente nas argumenta es uma imagem low profile
6511332 desde julho moroni j percorreu praticamente todos os bairros de fortaleza e come a agora a rodar de novo nessas localidades
6511333 enquanto outros candidatos est o nos palanques ele est no porta a porta com o p no ch o abra ando e conversando com o eleitor
6511334 alexandre trouxe para a campanha um grupo de executivos que trabalha em cima de resultados com baixo custo e alta produtividade e benef cios
6511335 a nica explica o at o momento para esse vi s de crescimento de moroni em cada pesquisa o trabalho duro que ele vem fazendo desde o primeiro momento na rua o velho porta a porta ele n o esperou pelo palanque eletr nico e come ou cedo indo aos bairros de periferia que s o verdadeiras pequenas cidades
6511336 isso quase o que gastamos com a cidade da m sica

6511338 make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
6511339 we expected today to be about gcse results and what you then find is one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy so people are very shocked and upset
6511340 ahmeds only been here a year the great achievement is he achieved 9 gcses
6511341 ive spoken to his family this morning and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6511342 family members came in and found out about his results but not his parents because they were too upset
6511343 the family is shocked and devastated his tutor said to me he never would have expected ahmed to be involved in this sort of incident
6511344 within the context of the school there is almost no issue to do with gangs because we try and create the hackney free community
6511345 clearly there are a lot of issues going on locally and nationally but they hardly impact on the school at all
6511346 but suddenly we have had this dreadful tragedy possibly as a result of gang activity
6511347 ive heard that he saw a gang chasing someone else and he thought they were carrying knives
6511348 apparently when he saw the knives he started to run towards the flats and the gang chased him
6511349 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6511350 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends
6511351 he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6511352 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6511353 the other group involved are described as black male youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas and were riding pedal cycles
6511354 i am appealing to anyone who witnessed the victim fall from the tower block and anyone who witnessed events prior to him fall to please contact police
6511355 a lot of times you become what you want to be in life and i wanted to be an engineer
6511356 i never wanted to run a company i didnt want to worry about money i didnt want to move up the management chain
6511357 i wanted to be an engineer for life and i wanted to stay at hewlett packard steve jobs had this dream to be one of the great people that wanted to create companies and make products that would change the world and be one of those people like shakespeare and einstein who become well known he wanted to be in that group so every time i designed something great from the time we were very young he would say lets sell it
6511358 i had very different approaches to things and i was mostly self taught
6511359 i would usually show my circuits and my code to people and it was a little different at first once they got it it was so compacted it was easy to understand and they appreciated it
6511360 steve has got one mind when it comes to controlling products and i think thats what makes them so good
6511361 ive been at the bottom of the apple org chart since day one
6511362 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6511363 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6511364 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6511365 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6511366 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6511367 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6511368 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6511369 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6511370 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6511371 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6511372 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6511373 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6511374 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6511375 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6511376 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6511377 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6511378 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6511379 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6511380 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6511381 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6511382 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6511383 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6511384 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6511385 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6511386 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6511387 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6511388 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6511389 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6511390 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6511391 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6511392 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6511393 ao prestar homenagem a nelson mandela desta forma recordamos que pre o ele teve de pagar para desfrutarmos de nossa liberdade
6511394 ladies and gentlemen my fellow executives distinguished members of the press wait for laughter to fade the state of our industry is strong and we will prevail in iraq
6511395 no really we actually do have a plan for wireless and that plan is to make money the details of the plan have yet to be finalized in fact truth be told there are no details as of yet the whole plan consists of using wireless to make money
6511396 and besides figuring out the details is below my pay grade im paid to lead not read
6511397 but the point is that cox along with the rest of the cable and satellite industry will definitely make money on wireless
6511398 and nevermind about pivot that joint venture with sprint nextel we were just trying to psyche everyone out with that service psyche psyche double psyche see we never intended to make any money from that
6511399 but starting today were going to make money from wireless were going to offer content and services over both wireline and wireless connections and well capture 20 of the wireless market at some point in the future
6511400 your articles are complete garbage my only true question for you is who hired youre a to write these meaningless waste of times ive blown around 5 10 mins of my life reading through a couple or your bios ridiculous articles and to be honest i want it back quit your job and throw some news papers around im sure people would appreciate that more over
6511401 the attachable plan must be bought in conjunction with any one of three domestic or two global data plans for pdas smartphones customers still have to shell out 45 85 a month on top of a monthly voice plan and it may still boost sprints overall revenues before this pam was 49 99 standalone with no base plan requirements

6511407 obama leads senator mccain by an incredible 30 points among gen y 11 points among seniors 8 points among gen x and 6 points among boomers
6511408 women are key to victory in the fall they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate

6511431 i sure am glad that i saw heard about that i would have missed out
6511432 we have met each other twice and the first time i won right now i beat him and i would say i am better than him
6511433 after each battle i was feeling better and better the semi final was very difficult and the final as well tigiyev is a very good sportsman and we know each other very well at the end of the second period i was under a huge amount of pressure
6511434 presently i am not feeling that i have won the gold medal maybe later once i am back to my motherland in dagestan i will feel that there are many olympic champions coming from this region of russia so i dont think they will erect a monument for me
6511435 well its all in the past now so we can dwell or we can move on
6511436 dolores aguilar born in 1929 in new mexico left us on aug
6511437 her family will remember dolores and amongst ourselves we will remember her in our own way which were mostly sad and troubling times throughout the years

6511440 the rain makes it better we felt like warriors out there
6511441 athens was just pure excitement the pressure of this situation is real and it was heavy and it was loud and we beat china at home under crazy conditions
6511442 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions no ones ever done it
6511443 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6511444 they are more experienced and stronger but we have made great strides for these olympic games this is the best that we could do
6511445 the leukemia has taught me to think step by step
6511446 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour
6511447 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6511448 its going to take a while for it to sink in
6511449 i gave it everything and now i have something to show for it its a once in a lifetime experience
6511450 i was shattered at the finish i just wanted a lie down and have a sleep but before i knew it i was on a stretcher
6511451 i was adamant this time last year i wasnt going to do it but i might have a rethink now and i have to work on my tactics a lot more
6511452 i knew maarten finished well so i was trying to stay with him
6511453 i had to battle with the group with 700m to go and i lost a lot of strength in the fight to stay in the race that cost me silver but i am happy with bronze
6511454 its the first time that i have got two cards in my career
6511455 i struggled in the water with a lot of athletes around me i didnt want to push them away
6511456 the conditions were really difficult today and we were quite nervous
6511457 after 10 years of training we finally got our first olympic medal we feel like were the luckiest ones here
6511458 we are here for gold but missed it because we stuffed it up at the start
6511459 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
6511460 i am happy with the draw because the reaction of the team in the last minute was good that is important
6511461 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public
6511462 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation

6511466 i looked the man in the eye i was able to get a sense of his soul
6511467 i think it is obvious that nato expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the alliance itself or with ensuring security in europe
6511468 on the contrary it represents a serious provocation against whom is this expansion intended
6511469 you cant cut that scene my niece is in it

6511472 i was thinking we could just go back and do it with cgi
6511473 we just decided to shoot it all on green screen
6511474 i think the team just came together the first time we played them cuba kicked our butts but that didnt deter us
6511475 we always fight we came together as one unit when we first started playing we played individually it was ugly and we made a lot of errors
6511476 the us team played very well however we didnt especially on service and reception
6511477 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6511478 this allows the icc the opportunity to plan with certainty the icc world twenty20 2009 as well as giving scotland plenty of preparation time ahead of the tournament
6511479 the companys method of fundraising is by issuing 200 million shares of the companys a share stock at nt 5 per share

6511482 due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play in this series
6511483 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time
6511484 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family

6511487 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time
6511488 if that does not turn out well then the treasury if they have not already done so will at that point be forced to step in and act more quickly than they would have
6511489 nobody is going to put equity capital or preferred stock into fannie and freddie with whats the government going to do hanging over your head
6511490 if the government were to provide support that didnt wipe out shareholders you will have another year of bad quarters and it then starts getting better so theres a lot of upside potential
6511491 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6511492 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6511493 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6511494 weve seen the industry really grow and shift into a fast paced business rather quickly
6511495 today were working as fast as possible to collect great footage that we can prepare for the immediate use of the industrys creative masterminds
6511496 maybe they need a scapegoat for why far eastern went under
6511497 i was amazed at what happened to stephen tsuei and philip chen with them prosecutors seeking such long prison terms
6511498 since 2005 the government has included the robotics industry in its national development plan and aims to make taiwan a global manufacturing and design center for intelligent robotics by 2015 hoping to boost the annual production value to nt 250 billion
6511499 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6511500 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6511501 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6511502 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6511503 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6511504 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6511505 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6511506 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6511507 i have been playing so bad i have been in a slump i cant even remember the last time i broke 80 i am very happy with the way i played today
6511508 im out here to just play golf i knew it was close my goal was to break 80 and if i do that thats good and if i win thats better i dont even keep up with the other players scores
6511509 i pulled a few shots but i dont really know if i just didnt have the right club in my hand or if it was just the head games i play
6511510 but i did chip well i always rely a lot on my chipping i was happy to be able to get it close enough to give me a chance
6511511 its not noticeable its a good solution to allow security at that end

6511514 a vaxfectin r formulated dna vaccine is a promising approach for the development of a new measles vaccine for young children
6511515 although a safe and effective live attenuated commercial measles vaccine is available measles continues to be a major cause of infant mortality
6511516 the immaturity of the immune system coupled with circulating maternal antibodies that interfere with the live attenuated vaccine severely limits vaccine effectiveness during an infants first year the juvenile and infant nonhuman primate studies provide encouragement that vaxfectin r formulated dna vaccination may be able to overcome these obstacles and may provide a viable alternative for infant immunization

6511547 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
6511548 the publication of these ground breaking results in the offers new hope to those patients with cf due to a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene and establishes a path forward for evaluating the efficacy and long term safety of ptc124
6511549 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6511550 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6511551 the publication of these data provides clinical proof of concept in cf for the ptc124 mechanism of action in overcoming nonsense mutations as the basis for treating genetic disease
6511552 based on these results we intend to initiate a phase 2b study later this year to evaluate the clinical benefit of ptc124 in adults and children with nonsense mutation mediated cf given the potential applicability of ptc124 to multiple genetic disorders we have a pivotal study of ptc124 for nonsense mutation duchenne becker muscular dystrophy ongoing and are planning proof of concept studies in additional genetic disorders

6511596 as far as nato and isaf international security assistance force are concerned the allegations in
6511597 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6511598 we have no reports of any casualties caused by close air support
6511599 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivery ordnance
6511600 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case

6511638 the first and most important one is that the city of mississauga is pursuing an initiative to grow ridership in mississauga transit and in order to do that there needs to be more buses
6511639 we needed to free up space to make an expansion of the storage and maintenance facilities
6511640 there are about 10 or 12 different stages in this process
6511641 we really hadnt provided any space for the growth in the workforce since 1990 when we last acquired additional space
6511642 these changes are partly about accommodating staff but its also doing things better
6511643 what happened was that as city hall grew offices were moved to various locations in the building without a great flow to it we had centres on different floors that are all part of the same process for building permits so we wanted to consolidate those different points of contact in one convenient location
6511644 so now they will all be co located at the same place so people will only have to come to the second floor to do everything
6511645 its a customer service enhancement but it was all a result of the other moves
6511646 we needed more space so weve moved some people to 201
6511647 so we took people from the transit depot and took some people from city hall and moved people around
6511648 weve signed for five years with the option of renewing for another five
6511649 weve bought ourselves some time to examine our longer term needs and how best to manage those well be undertaking a study to see what options are there all the options are on the table we could continue to lease or purchase a property
6511650 we had a lot of assistance from the design firm comely van brussel they did a lot of the design work urbacon was the contractor for the renovations and poi interiors did our move management
6511651 the city has a fibre optic network throughout its community

6511663 you and i both drink from the same well of inspiration the difference is that you get to piss in it
6511664 one of the guys at warner said i had made a proposal to make a really interesting set of games i can remember him not even blinking and looking at me and saying nolan why dont you innovate kind of like you did last year none of this new stuff he did not understand what he said he was so out of tune with what the nature of innovation is and ive been thinking i was going to get that put into needle point sometime
6511665 these people were my friends and co workers and we were sort of united in this quest for cool stuff
6511666 the marketing department had never played a video game marketing thought the programmers were lazy the programmers thought marketing was stupid we didnt like them they didnt like us
6511667 warner put a lot of money into the company which certainly helped pay for marketing and manufacturing the games and computers
6511668 if there is anything engineers despise it is dumb marketers defining the impossible
6511669 i see us as having built a record player and now its up to our creative people to decide how many records there will be
6511670 the thought of taking something that cost 3 and selling it for 20 or selling it for 40 i take great pride in that as a concept
6511671 you cant disappear and walk in six months later and say lets do this
6511672 they had no sales no advertising no marketing nothing but r amp d
6511673 we had a very powerful engineering team working on a lot of projects a lot more than manny thought we should have
6511674 where we became unglued was when manny started killing the research projects i saw that as building a very fragile company
6511675 we had a lot of fun warner had owned it for a while but nolan was still running it
6511676 it was all sort of started by nolan bushnell who was the founder and he kind of instilled this family friendly feeling parties every friday but you had to get your job done or otherwise you didnt hang around too long
6511677 it was a cool job to have for me it was like dying and going to heaven
6511678 people in the engineering group worked very hard its true that it was a casual environment and the kind of clothes you wore was not important in the engineering group results were what counted
6511679 it was an environment with little discipline but yet with clearly stated goals
6511680 when i started they just said we want you to do a game in about six months you have no set hours we dont even want to see you until the game is almost done it was great
6511681 i believe that atari in the early days succeeded because the games were labors of love by the programmers who worked on them at least that was the case with my games for me in those old far off days each game for the 2600 was done entirely by one person the programmer who conceived the game concept wrote the program did the graphics
6511682 the game is uncontrollable joystick movement is sluggish and clumsy and likely to drive an experienced player to irritation
6511683 my game hangman was the first 4k byte cart for the vcs but the extra space in that cart was simply used to store additional words being the first one to use that part i had to electronically qualify it with the rom vendor synertec to make sure it met the timing and current requirements of the vcs
6511684 jamming a baseball program into 2k of memory forced the designers to prune away many of the elements of real sport there are lots of factors that worry earl weaver that wont lose managers in
6511685 the title of an atari vcs game i programmed called hunt amp score was also later marketed by atari under the title a game of concentration in the early days of the vcs atari frequently changed the cart titles for games marketed under the sears tele games brand hunt amp core was called memory match for sears
6511686 a pair of skillful drivers with the killer instinct drive up and down the streets of a city firing hood mounted cannons at each other
6511687 it would have never gotten published in any normal situation but atari needed product and published everything the programmers produced in 1978
6511688 this was the first game i did for the 2600 so it was a big learning experience it was difficult to do a game in 2k bytes of rom 128 bytes of ram including the stack and writing to the screen on the fly i wanted to do something like stratego but realized i couldnt do it on a single screen so i turned it into a capture the flag type of game it took about six months to complete the graphics were pretty bad but the gameplay was very good
6511689 another programmer ian shepherd became available at the same time since
6511690 the follow up had to support 1978 vintage arcade games we knew we would need to leapfrog the 2600 before somebody else did it also had to support home computer character and bitmap graphics we saw the apple ii commodore and radio shack appliance machines coming
6511691 the atari 800s architecture evolved as an upgrade of the 2600 conceived primarily by steve mayer joe decuir and jay miner before i arrived at atari the original plan for the pokey chip called for keyboard interface audio and paddle controllers
6511692 there is a period at atari when there were no games coming from larry kaplan alan miller bob whitehead and myself as the most senior designers at atari we were tasked with creating the 800 operating system this group plus two others wrote the entire operating system in about 8 months a funny story from this time that al miller likes to tell has to do with the atari basic cartridge that was to ship with the system atari had contracted with a young programmer named bill gates to modify a basic compiler that he had for another system to be used on the 800 after that project stalled for over a year al was called upon to replace him with another developer so while al is the only person i know ever to have fired bill gates i suspect that rather than work on atari basic gates was spending all his time on dos for ibm probably not a bad career choice for him do you think
6511693 im very proud of the os we created for the atari 400 800 it was similar in complexity to qdos the os that microsoft licensed a couple of years later from seattle computer products and renamed ms dos for the ibm personal computers however the atari os was much better designed in terms of its user friendliness and it had a much much richer graphics subsystem and many fewer bugs
6511694 graphic and cabinet design were a shared resource and graphics meant physical stuff not pixels teams did their own pixels which we called dots at the time none of us having taken a computer graphics class
6511695 sky raider will be a super attraction game it was first previewed at the ate show in london where the overall reaction was superb
6511696 in which rocks fell from the top of screen and had to be caught by the player soon after in june atari released the
6511697 i was a pinball fan so this is the first video game to have a pinball feature when i asked for it i had to fight to get it added because they thought i was crazy
6511698 in the end we put three variations in one game progressive double and cavity
6511699 marketing felt just flying was not fun enough so we added star wars like objects that flew down the tube at you and you had to shoot them it was a good game but they kept wanting changes it did a solid 2 and 3 for 12 weeks in tests but atari could not decide to ship it
6511700 several folks at atari had wanted to do a football game for a while by the time i got there i believe steve bristow and lyle rains were the main promoters of the idea however the technology was not quite up to it with the move toward microprocessor controlled games it started looking possible
6511701 i did a little product called touch me which was a hand held version of milton bradleys simon which was milton bradleys version of ataris coin op
6511702 by the time i got to atari in the summer if 1978 nolan was just being phased out by ray kassar
6511703 the day that we shipped the 2600 i felt we needed to spend engineering money on getting the next one by the time it was there the technology had advanced so much that we could build a much better video game warner was horrified by the idea they wanted to be in the 45 rpm record business and just sell records for ever and i told them it doesnt work that way every two to three years you need to upgrade your hardware and their decision to not upgrade the hardware was really what led to the collapse of the business in 1982
6511704 i felt that the computer system should not be a closed system we needed to have third party software developers i could see steve jobs out evangelizing and atari was saying that if you write software for the atari computers we will sue you i just thought that was foolhardy they were from the record world where you sue people
6511705 the meeting warners annual budget meeting took place in november it proved to be bushnells downfall before a crowd of high level executives bushnell and gerard locked horns screaming at each other for hours
6511706 dont forget i also hired ray kassar if there was a problem with marketing as warner claims i solved that problem by hiring ray
6511707 i realized no matter what the title was the real shots were going to be called from
6511708 you can spend your life doing woulda shoulda coulda i wish i hadnt sold to warner because i think that the world would be a very different place with atari being the preeminent video game company today
6511709 since there were only six labs in the world that could do n channel you created a virtual monopoly with a series of contracts it was so simple ray kassar was not a technologist so he had no clue about what was going on
6511710 in fact when al alcorn told me what had happened i didnt understand what he was saying i couldnt conceive of atari cutting off its future by chopping off its r amp d work it will always be my opinion that being engineering oriented was what made atari successful
6511711 it became this almost passionate religious quest and the more religious fervor the better and more interesting the games turned out to be
6511712 they kind of ripped the core out of what created ataris brilliance and excellence
6511713 i do remember discussions in the lab of how stupid it was to assume we can do a chess game and how impossible it was to do and thats all i needed you see the word impossible it seems has always been one of my igniters it gets the puzzle solver in me going
6511714 the higher ups at atari wanted a cartridge that would allow the user to learn simple programming and i had been vocal in expressing my interest in doing a programming language before management came up with this i was the only 2600 programmer who had studied computer science
6511715 i was finishing my first video game on the atari 2600 console i got a chance at a stanford research lab to play the original text adventure game which was called adventure thank you don woods and willie crowther i decided that this idea a journey through a network of rooms with objects you could move from place to place and obstacles and monsters to get past could work as a video game
6511716 ataris parent company owned the first superman movie which was about to come out and decided that i was to change
6511717 before warner acquired atari from nolan bushnell the vcs programmers had the freedom to design their own games from concept to finish it was an intense joyfully creative period that did not survive the takeover
6511718 each 2600 game was designed entirely by one person but on the package it said basically adventure by atari and we were only getting salaries no cut of the huge profits it was a signature like at the bottom of a painting but to make it happen i had to hide my signature in the code in a really obscure place and not tell anybody
6511719 my model in creating the secret room was the secret messages hidden in beatle records i buried paul in the late sixties where you had to play the record backwards to hear the message atari manufactured several hundred thousand
6511720 finding that dot and then the secret room was one my first memories of playing video games i read about the easter egg in atari age magazine and worked for hours and hours to finally get the process to work seeing that secret room for the first time was like magic
6511721 we all were very unhappy with the changes warner was making we felt correctly i think they did not understand that game programmers were creative types not engineering types and needed to be treated accordingly
6511722 at that time david bob larry and i accounted for about two thirds of atari cart sales
6511723 as time went on it soon became clear that there were rock stars there were people of extraordinary talent that deserved to make a whole bunch of money
6511724 i researched the compensation aspects of the recording industry and the book industry drafted a contract that would allow me to be credited for my work and receive a very modest royalty and presented it to atari management after a while i told my three closest associates at atari david crane bob whitehead and larry kaplan what i was doing they joined me in those discussions we developed a growing impression that atari was going to agree to some plan along the lines we proposed
6511725 they wrote a letter to ray kassar saying give us a share give us a fair share
6511726 i told the truth too often and left in august of 1979
6511727 their value to the company was such that you could easily see they would have value to another company
6511728 i was always intrigued by hercules and i still am i try play it when i go to the redondo beach fun factory one of the only places that still has an operating version of the game while it certainly is an experience i cant say it is actually fun to play
6511729 atari pinball machines were disasters but they were also artistic masterpieces i mean we worked day and night seven days a week on superman which was the state of the art and then it got killed thats probably something i never really forgave the corporation for
6511730 bally could have produced in two weeks what took us four months which is why we dropped out of pinball in 1979
6511731 it was a mess but we pulled the plug too soon
6511732 the original architecture for ataris vector generator came out of the grass valley group they built a prototype of a system that could display vectors on an appropriate monitor it wasnt ready for production but it did clearly demonstrate the viability of their ideas
6511733 vector graphics sometimes called xy graphics were great for video games because they provided very high resolution razor sharp images in a day when 200 x 180 pixels was considered hi res
6511734 at the same time rick moncrief was working on the display i dont know if he started from scratch or was provided a preliminary design from grass valley rick and i worked together since our respective elements had to work together in any finished product
6511735 of course a finished product needed to include a game and so i was made project leader for ataris first vector graphic game i decided to go with the classic vector game
6511736 as the design of the hardware and game progressed other engineers became interested in using it a team composed of lyle rains ed logg and steve callfee had been working for some time on a traditional raster game called
6511737 asteroids surpassed space invaders thats when the business community started to think that maybe video games were not flukes
6511738 the original vector generator hardware that was used in lunar lander and asteroids was almost completely digital it became clear to me that a vector generator was one place where analog circuitry could outperform digital in cost and efficiency i redesigned a portion of the hardware to replace digital components with analog circuitry and the analog vector generator was born although the player in the arcade wouldnt know the difference the change shrunk the size of the circuit board and lowered its cost
6511739 foul and yer out it didnt make it into the final product i believe that i have the only prototype of this voice unit at home even though it never made it into production it was probably the first voice unit ever put into a coin op game
6511740 i did not believe video pinball would be successful however there were places video games could go that large pinball machines could not in the end the game earned more than i expected and it was a commercial success
6511741 ed logg is the worlds greatest games designer hes done the most the best games
6511742 1979 will be a year of new product introductions the most ambitious of these new products is our new line of personal computers the atari 400 and atari 800 the entry into this marketplace is a significant challenge to all of us the market is very competitive and the quality and product performance standard very high
6511743 it is hard to overstate what a feat these machines were based largely on the apple they were designed to do everything the apple could do and then some as it turned out the machines were so far ahead of their time atari ended up having no clear idea just what to do with them
6511744 the big difference was warner communications against steve jobs warner could never win that one i dont know if i could have but i wouldnt have made the same mistakes warner did the main problem that allowed apple to dominate was in fact not technology but business strategy steve was out evangelizing to software developers to build software for their machines our strategy with the video games was that we basically wanted to give away the hardware and make money on the software that called for a quasi closed system warner thought that was the right way to do the computers business too so they said not only are we not going to help third party developers were going to sue you if you use our operating environment so everybody that wanted to get into the software business supported apple over atari so basically warner drove the coffin nail in the atari 800 despite it having a clearly superior chipset a better operating environment we had a lot of innovations in the atari 800 that became standard later on
6511745 all of us on the project strongly urged senior management to make the atari 400 800 an open design and publish the operating system and hardware manuals
6511746 the first official small shipment of the 400 800 was on
6511747 we believe that the atari computers are different because from word one they were developed to take away whatever apprehensions a first time user might have and help him or her feel good about interfacing with our product with atari computers you dont have to stop and think before you use them of course more and more of the younger generation are learning to program and work with more sophisticated applications and they will have the capability of doing so with our product
6511748 conrad jutson was an extremely thoughtful erudite gentleman with twenty years in consumer electronics most recently in the stereo field his experience in that industry revealed a clear understanding of the computer as the central console in a components oriented system as it turned out he and atari were a little ahead of their time
6511749 with the introduction of the atari line of computers we are seeing a third generation of microcomputer not just from the hardware end but also from a marketing approach these computers are slightly cheaper than those of the previous generation the major difference is in the configuration and the application for which the systems were designed a recent article in computing described the atari computers as hybrids a cross between a video game and a small computer
6511750 on september 4 1979 i began my career as a professional game designer at atari the new atari home computer system hcs with two models the 400 and 800 was just coming out and all the game designers wanted to work on those machines management therefore ordered that everybody who wanted to work on the home computers must first complete one on the game machine
6511751 they didnt want the 800 to be seen as just a game machine they wanted to compete with the apple ii
6511752 as atari grew wildly and with the uncontainable force of mount st helens it also grew schizoid it quickly evolved into a three headed beast the coin op division the consumer games division and the home computer division all operated pretty much independently of one another
6511753 remember that atari senior management fundamentally didnt understand the business they didnt seem to know much about or care about the engineer group i can remember that during our negotiations my boss boss told me that he could hire several engineers off the street who could do what i did for the amount of money i was asking for he was essentially clueless about the intricacies of programming the vcs and the creative challenges of designing good games
6511754 atari fueled the suspicion with their own game machine their atari 2600 video game machine was truly the gadget of the year and ataris exhibit featured wall to wall games that attracted huge crowds
6511755 the vcs was not doing that well there were only a few million in the field and it looked like it was dying then space invaders came out and bam it exploded
6511756 with a vcs you have to unlearn every good programming practice youve learned
6511757 after a few months i got it to where it was fun to play but few seemed to be interested in it nobody wanted to play it
6511758 kassar went to japan in 1979 for one purpose and one purpose only to get space invaders he did so cutting a brilliant deal that would generate millions of dollars for atari and launch the 2600 into orbit
6511759 one of the biggest blockbusters this christmas season is expected to be the atari space invaders electronic game that every day draws lines at the model at woodward amp lothrops downtown store
6511760 the 2600 version of othello i did on the side until my boss caught me at work once making the final changes before it went into production
6511761 how about that fireworks show when you scored a goal was that awesome or what
6511762 my first project in this group was night driver which started with larry kaplan handing me a bunch of code and saying maybe you can get this to work it seems like too of a headache basically i think he was mentally on his way out the door at that point and didnt want to start another game
6511763 when i sold the company to warner and after i left ray kassar looked at and said bushnell is a real idiot why does he have five different chip manufacturing projects going along he cancelled all but the best ones one went to ti one went to bally and one went to mattel all of a sudden with the stroke of a pen he generated three major competitors
6511764 according to engineering logs in 1981 atari began work on a new video game console to replace the atari 2600 video computer system this new console during development took on many codenames sylvia super stella and also pam with notes next to it saying super stella multipurpose this new console was to be based on a new 10 bit processor and would have more memory higher resolution graphics and improved sound while maintaining compatibility with all existing atari 2600 console games
6511765 you played a tabletop game then a hologram appeared they made you think the games were going to be holograms
6511766 the reason atari 800 was different from the original was very simple and somewhat embarrassing i was 23 years old at the time and with one port already under my belt 2600 night driver i figured i was far too cool to do another straight port of an existing coin op game you have to remember that at atari programmers had nobody that approved their plans basically people like myself were given 100 percent liberty to create whatever we wanted there was no approval process no pitch meetings no specs that needed sign off in retrospect such freedom is really astonishing to me given what is now required to put something into production but at that time it was totally up to the programmer nobody told me to do space invaders it was my choice i decided to change the original not because i thought the original was broken in any way but simply because i was looking to make my mark whatever that meant
6511767 one of the very few decisions they were confident in was the decision to clearly differentiate the home computer from the video game machine so the rule was simple no more games
6511768 star raiders was to be a 3 d version of the star trek game played on the mainframe computers of that time the star trek game was all text and not played in real time but it had the idea of ship damage and sector scanners and charts
6511769 the employees in the company went bonkers over the game which was the first true to life three dimensional videogame the visual effects were dazzling especially when the stars whizzed by when you warped or when the four kinds of enemy ships came zooming out of nowhere either behind or in front of you
6511770 its pretty amazing the way the game caught on i think it was the first game to combine action with a strategy screen and luckily the concept worked out pretty well
6511771 the name of the game is star raiders it is the best possible combination of a shooting gallery and a planetarium it is the reason i was up till 1 a m the night before it costs about 530 to own one assuming youve already got a color tv
6511772 who would buy a serious computer from the worlds most successful video game and arcade company
6511773 unfortunately atari neutralized their own advantage to everyones shock and dismay they decided to keep secret vital technical information like memory maps and bus architectures which programmers needed to write software they then tried to blackmail programmers by indicating that they could get technical information only if they signed up to write atari brand software this alienated the fiercely independent hobbyist programmer community and as a result many serious programmers started writing software for other machines instead by the time atari realized their mistake and started wooing the serious programmers it was too late the only programmers who remained loyal were game programmers
6511774 the attitude of the executives was we want to make all the money on the software we dont want any competitors they were having competitors with the vcs and the programmers were trying to explain that no thats not how it works you need a big library of software you need to encourage them and i was one of the people doing that
6511775 there is a little bit of a spooky message in that whole game when you have that final cloud at the end
6511776 it was actually developed in one of our company brainstorming sessions we had recently developed the vector display technology thanks to howard delman and of course our first thoughts were to do a first person 3d perspective game i honestly dont remember who first proposed the tank format concept at those meetings
6511777 there was a group of consultants for the army a bunch of retired generals and such that approached atari with the idea that the technology for battlezone could be used to make a training simulator for the then new infantry fighting vehicle the idea was that such a simulator could be made into a game that would encourage the soldiers to use it they would learn not only the basic operation of the ifv technology but would also learn to distinguish between the friendly and enemy vehicle silhouettes
6511778 the rumor goes something like this the pentagon or the cia or the fbi collaborated with atari in the development of a realistic video war game what they were after isnt clear and the reasoning differs from rumor to rumor either the pentagon wanted to subliminally train future personnel in the art of video or the pentagon wanted to locate and recruit immediately those talented gamesters with the most impressive war game skills whether they found what they were after or whether the story is even true is certainly top secret information the game was real enough however and was appropriately titled missile command
6511779 the army has noticed that the young people they work with like these types of games so theyve been asking themselves why cant we use this thing
6511780 an agreement is being drawn up whereby atari will produce training prototypes for both the armys m60a1 tank and its chaparral missile air defense system
6511781 i was vehemently opposed to atari getting into this sort of business at all remember the world was a very different place in 1981 than it is now there was still a soviet union who was perceived to be our nations biggest threat my contention was that many of us engineers had the option to go to work for companies doing military contracting and we consciously chose to work at a company that was not so involved
6511782 the best feeling for a game designer is to go out into an arcade and see people having fun playing the game that they created there is nothing better than that to walk around and see all the other games and know that people can choose from anything in there but they are playing your game that is pretty heavy stuff
6511783 when i came in the product was perceived as a fad a christmas item what we did was try to convince the trade and the consumer it was an everyday product with a long life
6511784 it was a wacky extremely competitive business i was there when coin operated games were earning 8 billion in quarters a year these games were out grossing the record industry and the movie industry combined in quarters
6511785 gamers pour 10 million quarters into asteroids coin operated machines every single day
6511786 asteroids deluxe was done by dave shepperd i did not have any input into this game other than the original code he worked from
6511787 but wait whats that over there coming out from behind that large asteroid over there its the zylor saucer you were sent in after dodging and weaving you suddenly realize theyve gotten a lot smarter and whats that strange looking asteroid that seems to be following you wait a minute thats no asteroid its a giant ship this is an ambush
6511788 centipede was an idea that came from a brainstorming session atari would have every year
6511789 centipede would be considered at best a casual game now which was so funny to me because it wasnt that at all it was an action game with a story and now it really doesnt have a narrative at all by todays standards it probably wouldnt even be released today
6511790 many theories have been suggested one is that it was created by a woman another is that destroying insects fits well with a womans psyche i believe this game appeals to women because it is not gender biased like fighting games or rpgs or sports games
6511791 i came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it i said what the heck is that dave he said i dont know aliens from the center of the earth i dont know i think he said something about having had a dream about it i said how does it work he said i dont know theyre coming up around the edge of this thing and youre trying to blow them away he just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there i can see why he would say that tempest was certainly his proudest achievement he worked extremely hard on that its pure creation from his own brain
6511792 tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine that is a good tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm i dont know exactly what to call it but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience you forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there
6511793 ray kassar was too scared to take a chance on the handheld tabletop market the atari 2600 vcs was the only thing he had faith in
6511794 i left atari because it ceased to be fun for me under the presidency of mr kassar
6511795 in 1981 roger hector ed rotberg and i left atari and founded videa inc our goal was to become a well regarded design firm in the video game business as well as in whatever other markets we could leverage our skills we ended up designing the arcade game gridlee for gottlieb a point of purchase merchandiser for byvideo and a couple of games for the atari vcs
6511796 they the general computer game enhancement appear to our customers and to the public as atari products creating confusion and siphoning off legitimate returns from our investment in research and development
6511797 they started getting really annoyed that we werent rolling away finally the light bulb went on they might as well design games for us so atari drops their lawsuit we signed a development deal with atari to do engineering for them
6511798 our contract was not with atari our contract was with warner who owned atari whatever we came up with would be force fed to the atari folks
6511799 anybody who has seen ataris star raiders knows that the atari personal computer system has vastly greater graphics capabilities than any other personal computer owners of these computers might wonder if they can get their machines to do the fabulous things that star raiders does the good news is that you can indeed write programs with graphics and animation every bit as good as star raiders
6511800 the atari is also the hot computer of the eighties at the consumer electronics show in
6511801 the color trs 80 is a joke in comparison to even the 400 the apple ii is archaic in technology next to the 800 and any other micro on the market just cant match the ataris built in computing power many computer stores wont carry the 400 or 800 there just isnt any software available well we receive software and new products at an almost daily basis at the analog office so much that we have a difficult time reviewing it all i am very impressed with the amount of really good software available in just a years time
6511802 weve been saying atari sales are picking up a more than gradual creep thats been in evidence since summer the trickle has apparently turned into a roar it seems the pipeline effectively ran dry in mid december when dealers across the country were selling machines faster than they could get them
6511803 if you own an atari 800 computer dont forget there are other game cartridges besides
6511804 the guy who cooked up the idea dale yocam was trying to explain to the management that there are a lot people out there that like to write programs and if we can publish these programs for them its a win win the management was not very interested in it he put together a business plan for it and said look we only need a little bit of money and this thing can be self sufficient and it might make some money they very grudgingly agreed to let him do it and so he did it and very quickly made it into a monster success it was a major profit center for atari they rewarded dale for his initiative by bringing in another guy to be dales boss so dale in disgust quit about a year later
6511805 i have no hesitation in calling this one of the very best war games available for a personal computer it is also a virtuoso demonstration of the awesome built in capabilities of the atari computer
6511806 initially they had never quite defined what it was that had to be kept secret i was the programmer at atari who had come in from the outside world and had more contacts with outsiders id be working on atari software and the phone would ring and it was somebody in indiana saying can i get any of the technical documents and i would go over to the main area and get a few of the technical documents photocopy them and mail them off there were enough loopholes that i was able to send out some documents and not get fired
6511807 our job was to provide technical support to outside programmers we had a whole package of goodies we provided for free by the way the main thing we did was this tour where i would travel around to cities all over the country we would rent a hotel meeting room and people could come in to these seminars where we taught them all about how to program the atari and i did almost all the work here i had a real barnstorming style my job was to wean people away from the apple to the atari i was pushing that line really hard somebody in one of the magazines that had come to it said crawford does a show like an old time evangelist you half way expect him to start quoting the bible and that is where the term software evangelist
6511808 i was sending out some minor stuff and then one day it was sort of like the dam broke and they had an official policy 180 degree reversal we want to tell everybody about this i immediately got on the phone and started calling a bunch of my contacts saying hey would you like complete technical documentation on the atari and we shipped a lot of those
6511809 theyre still selling as fast as they can make them what else can we say
6511810 atari inc is absolutely committed to the consumer business and despite the fact that it is almost alone in believing that now is the time to do it the warner communications inc subsidiary is betting its future on the home computer and ignoring todays high flying markets
6511811 ataris aggressive pricing moves in the wake of commodores announcement of the vic 20 last spring seem to be bringing rewards we hear that monthly sales now approach last years annual sales figures and the numbers are still growing
6511812 the units were complete boxes were manufactured color dealer flyers were sent out it appears everything was ready apparently during the quality assurance testing of the atari 2700 rc stella by john protsman it turned out that the controllers emitted a signal within a 1000 foot radius what this meant was the units would cause havoc with other atari 2700s nearby also the controller electronics were based on the design of a garage door opener so the controllers would have the possibility of causing other remote controlled devices to operate
6511813 for dodge em i was the centerfold for both playboy and high times as being the best game of the year so i thought id really made it
6511814 i did end up getting some flack for the changes i made to space invaders for the 8 bit though not via management but from my peers such is why i ended up making my next project missile command as faithful a replica to the original coin op as i possibly could
6511815 asteroids needed the 8k though after the game was complete bob smith and i spent some time using every trick we knew to try to get it into 4k but it just would not fit
6511816 the present invention provides a bank switching memory and method for increasing the number of individual address locations that can be addressed in a digital system the present invention expands the available memory space beyond that capable of being addressed by a conventional addressing having a unique memory location associated with a unique address specifically the invention is used to expand the number of rom memory locations contained in the game cartridge of a video game system without requiring additional address lines
6511817 the ultimate electronics toy wont be found in a toy department alongside the tv sets and stereos merchants are pushing such electronic marvels as ataris video computer system featuring 18 different games and a price of 169
6511818 atari for years was using the leverage that they had to just screw distributors everywhere when they had a hot game they would force distributors to buy copies of the old games that werent selling anymore just to get copies of the new game
6511819 i think they sold 2 3 million copies of the thing it made 30 40 million dollars and i got a turkey
6511820 i was considering going out on my own i had been with atari for five and a half years which is a long time in this valley the standard dream of every engineer is to start your own company someday and become rich hey this was the opportunity id been waiting 11 years for i knew a lot about engineering but nothing about marketing the more bill and i talked the more we seemed like a natural match
6511821 a 6 million ad campaign touts intellivisions graphic superiority over atari 2600 news media take note start covering video game war raising profile of entire industry although the 300 intellivision is twice as expensive as the 2600 sales soar reaching 850 000 consoles by years end
6511822 the lawsuit was timed perfectly it was front page news at the january ces in las vegas and catapulted the unknown activision to a big player and our sales skyrocketed and we never looked back
6511823 after we started activision they sued us three times every six months both personally and as a corporation their total damage claim as i recall eventually stood at 26 million it was sheer harassment there was no basis for their claims and it was eventually settled for nothing activision was funded by one of silicon valley s most prominent and experienced venture capital companies in starting the company we did everything perfectly properly under the strict guidance of our attorneys and investors
6511824 nearly four million homes now have programmable videogame systems this year alone americans will buy two million videogame systems and 20 million cartridges to use with them
6511825 i think it gave the readers a sense of community it was the only way they could really interact with us and with one another and q amp a was at that point the nexus for all fan information on the world of gaming
6511826 it makes you feel blessed its definitely a blessing this game is a revolving door guys come in and guys leave the fact you can stick around 10 plus is a good thing
6511827 so i dont feel like that was an issue the biggest thing you have in your favor though if you have continued to work is you know an awful lot in terms of your education of quarterbacks receivers what offenses want to do to combat certain defenses
6511828 so you are able to size up situations a lot faster with a lot more knowledge with just a huge database of information to pull from in a lot of ways the game becomes a very manageable experience for veteran players even when they do start to lose a step and that experience is something that is hard to get you really have to put in the time to be a good player
6511829 im a little heavier maybe than i was when i came in but im a lot smarter
6511830 i dont know if im as fast as i was but im still fast as hell back then i had young fresh legs but i know where im going now and it makes all the difference in the world
6511831 you have to be mentally tough you have to be smart and each year you have to try to get better at a different element of the game
6511832 all of us in this game with 10 plus years weve seen a lot a lot of things come easier to us than a guy just coming in
6511833 you dont want those hamstrings to go now because the recovery time gets longer and longer
6511834 corners weve just got to be able to run i dont lift as much heavy weight as i used to because weve got to be able to run to be able to move and react running is lifting for your legs
6511835 theres a lot of factors that can go into it
6511836 you may not be that good you may get injuries who knows for any player regardless of defensive backs linemen quarterback to get 10 years in the nfl its a tough sport so its definitely a blessing so i count my blessings every day because the average career in the nfl i think is 3 2 years or something most guys are in and out of here before they ever get started
6511837 it would be great to have an olympic gold medal
6511838 but if you asked any player would you rather have an olympic gold medal or a green jacket or claret jug more players would say the majors
6511839 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching
6511840 attention is definitely straying said rupa patel a spokeswoman for the dating service
6511841 a lot of it ties back to sex and relationship
6511842 when you give people chances and allow them to come back from their mistakes great things happen and im a perfect example that you shouldnt give up on people
6511843 michel is one of my greatest friends its an honour to be in the same category as him its going to take some time to sink in
6511844 the withdrawal of the russian troops which have reinforced the peacekeepers from the territory of georgia is going according to plan and will be completed in 10 days
6511845 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6511846 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6511847 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6511848 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6511849 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6511850 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6511851 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6511852 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6511853 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6511854 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6511855 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6511856 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6511857 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6511858 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6511859 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6511860 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6511861 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6511862 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6511863 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6511864 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6511865 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6511866 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6511867 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6511868 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6511869 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6511870 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6511871 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6511872 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6511873 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6511874 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6511875 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6511876 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6511877 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6511878 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6511879 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6511880 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6511881 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
6511882 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6511883 there was virtually no difference between random sperm whale movement and the movement of whales that were in the vicinity of seismic activities
6511884 the sperm whales are not only different from those living outside the region
6511885 but groups living in one part of the gulf have different home ranges and core areas than those living in other parts of the gulf our tracking suggests that there are concentrations of whales in both the eastern and western waters of the gulf although their ranges overlap to some extent
6511886 over time this regionalized emphasis may lead to genetic differences
6511887 there may be an onion skin effect where the layer of whales moving along the upper continental slope rarely interact with other layers of animals farther offshore in deeper water
6511888 the combination of the new tags with advanced acoustic techniques will be useful in determining the safe distance for whales from human activities that generate loud or unusual underwater noises
6511889 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters
6511890 to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live
6511891 were thrilled to partner with rock the vote to make it easier than ever for youth voters and our members to register and be heard
6511892 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6511893 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6511894 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6511895 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6511896 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6511897 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6511898 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6511899 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success

6511902 georgia has no other choice people have understood that if it is georgia today attacked by russian forces then tomorrow it could be poland or the czech republic
6511903 georgia was a russian colony for more than 200 years but this is the 21st century the time for colonies is over georgia now has the strong support of the outside world
6511904 the lands of south ossetia and abkhazia are our georgian land the demands of our people for their return are legitimate
6511905 i appeal to russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin to immediately end the occupation of georgia and to take their forces off its territory
6511906 some people i wont mention who have been calling him inappropriate names like crazy and retard
6511907 just because someone called him that as a nickname doesnt mean that thats what his name is does anyone know what his real name is
6511908 his name is joire armen and it would be kind of you if you would refer to him as just that

6511924 right now lawsuits like these are the steam valve representing the extreme frustration users are having with wireless carriers
6511925 wireless carriers have tremendous market power over devices and are the primary influence in manufacturing
6511926 there is no industry wireless phone standard and because of their marketing power the carriers have little incentive to make sure devices deliver on promises
6511927 this is not a harbinger of something new as its a bit frivolous
6511928 unless we start putting cell towers every 20 feet were not going to avoid drop calls but it could make carriers pay more attention to providing better services
6511929 i dont find device connectivity a problem and havent heard of many people with a problem

6511933 we think the community is ready to do something different with its schools
6511934 the question is why dont they want to send their kids to the schools
6511935 a lot of people still have that old way of thinking that if a school has a lot of minorities their kids wont get a good education
6511936 i know its a real uncomfortable discussion and i think we tip toe around it but i think we need to talk to the people who arent coming to the meetings and who dont have kids in the u city schools and ask them why
6511937 we need to talk about race of course we do
6511938 to say its always about race may not be true

6511943 in the past first time home buyers were willing to purchase older more basic houses in an effort to save money and break into homeownership
6511944 today this group has greater home expectations because they have grown up more accustomed to their parents lifestyles
6511945 first time home buyers now have higher standards placing an increased focus on the financial aspects of home ownership and at the same time want a larger home they can live in right away
6511946 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
6511947 brits are simply not proactive or spontaneous during their bank holidays preferring to lounge around the house or catch up on some rest

6511949 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
6511950 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
6511951 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
6511952 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
6511953 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
6511954 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
6511955 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
6511956 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
6511957 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6511958 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
6511959 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
6511960 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
6511961 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
6511962 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
6511963 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
6511964 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
6511965 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
6511966 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
6511967 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
6511968 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
6511969 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
6511970 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
6511971 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
6511972 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
6511973 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
6511974 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
6511975 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
6511976 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
6511977 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
6511978 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

6512024 while lewis affirms the importance of social spaces that accommodate and stimulate the potentials of persons and grant to persons a sense of being a home he offers no realistic models of social space equivalent to those he gives for personal spaces and open landscapes

6512037 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6512038 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6512039 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6512040 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope

6512052 when peter lopez first asked me to coach him internationally to help him to make the 2008 olympic team i must admit that i had mixed emotions in order for me to coach him i would have to wear a peruvian uniform this in itself was not easy for me at all
6512053 if i am cut and i bleed then i will bleed stars and stripes
6512054 the peruvians are a people that have and continue to endure a great deal their poor struggle and endeavor to find a means to earn a living even with an economy that is growing by 9 per year and rich deposits of silver copper gold and other minerals peru still has no sizable middle class and it seems the poor have no discernable means of breaking the chain of poverty
6512055 it is in this atmosphere that peter and i trained for over two weeks leading down the home stretch to the olympic games
6512056 with that said this support should not be misinterpreted as having granted the department of environmental protection a carte blanche

6512061 they all did an outstanding job of getting the word out to their friends and neighbors we could not have had such a successful event without them
6512062 we are here because we know ari hoffnung and see in him the talent that can assure vibrant representation in our city council ari has impressed me with his organizational expertise
6512063 with a 6 1 match of gifts up to 175 per person and an overall spending limit of 200 000 all viable candidates compete on a level playing field with an individual gift cap of 2 750 no person or special interest can buy a candidate and billionaires dont run for the city council
6512064 young people who need better schools working people who require new skills to compete in a global economy and seniors who deserve better services i do not claim to have all the solutions for the serious problems we face as a society i can however tell you that if i am fortunate enough to be elected as your city council representative i will fight day and night to make sure that our community and our city become an even better place to live
6512065 one of the reasons im running for office is my motivation to engage in work that involves tikkun olam repairing the world on a full time basis
6512066 as a member of the city council i hope to work on issue impacting people of all ethnic and religious backgrounds like the overall decline in the quality of public school education and the increase in the number of families at risk of going hungry
6512067 i am energized by this outpouring of support and am honored that so many people have been so generous
6512068 given the level of financial support we have been able to generate over a year before the election i am confident that this campaign will have all the resources we need for the september 2009 primary
6512069 this level of grassroots support ensures that we will run an independent campaign that is responsive to citizens rather than to special interests and corporations
6512070 the great thing about the matching funds program is that it amplifies the voice of smaller donors by leveraging their contribution at a rate of 6 to 1 i tell people all the time that while their 25 50 or 100 contribution may not seem that significant to them it has a huge impact on our campaign when it is matched with 150 300 or 600 of city funds
6512071 i too am frustrated about the lack of parking in our neighborhoods
6512072 we must implement fresh and new ideas to increase parking spaces so we spend less time driving in circles wasting gasoline and creating needless pollution
6512073 for too many residents this issue is greatly affecting their quality of life
6512074 we have to think creatively in order to solve our parking problem but we also need city hall to help make this happen
6512075 for those people like me who do not have a driveway or garage spot parking on the street is the only option
6512076 by reducing the number of days that drivers must search for spots we will be able to help reduce local congestion and make everyone s life a bit easier
6512077 our neighborhoods cannot continue to create more housing without creating more parking
6512078 the current zoning laws which require buildings to provide parking spots for 60 percent or less of their units are outdated and should be updated to mandate at least one spot per apartment
6512079 we must think creatively if we are serious about solving the parking shortage crisis with increases in construction population and cars the status quo will be a step in the wrong direction
6512080 and as their frustration grows it becomes time to offer solutions

6512097 the question is is the hospital acting as an immigration agent in effect by deporting this patient
6512098 its important to make sure that hospitals arent permitted to dump patients on an international level when they cant do it on a local level
6512099 hospitals dont have the financial resources to meet all of the acute care needs of patients without insurance let alone take on all the chronic care needs that present with patients like this
6512100 there were certain legal procedures that the hospital should have followed that they bypassed
6512101 we have worked with the individual who has had primary decision making responsibility for the patient
6512102 if you obey all the rules you miss all the fun
6512103 what we want to do is impossible thats sure so lets start working

6512115 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety

6512142 the grain filling stage is the second most critical stage in corn with pollination being the most critical
6512143 yield can be negatively impacted during grain fill by weather conditions such as excessive heat solar radiation wind and lack of rain late season irrigation is one tool that can be used wisely to minimize any negative weather effects so grain filling can continue and not be ended prematurely
6512144 daily yield gains of 4 to 5 bushels per acre are possible under good growing conditions during grain fill and daily yield increases of 2 to 4 bushels per acre are common
6512145 growers need to look at several factors before beginning an irrigation event
6512146 this includes reviewing the types of soil for each field looking at how well that soil stores water reserves and also the stage of the corn growers can contact their local pioneer agronomist for assistance on assessing water reserves and soil type
6512147 irrigation planning should be based on sound information about the crop soil water reserves and weather conditions
6512148 a specific calendar date for ending the irrigation season may be the worst choice producers need to be flexible and make decisions about the last irrigation event based on anticipated crop water needs and rainfall
6512149 one problem that occurs is that producers sometimes rely too much on soil water reserves that may have become overly depleted during the season
6512150 past studies have suggested soil water reserves could be depleted as much as 80 percent during the final stages of corn production without harming yield
6512151 that has not been our experience in this study yield reductions began to occur when available soil water reserves were as high as 50 percent it seems likely that with the great corn hybrids and other advanced production technologies we have today that less water stress can be tolerated without an appreciable economic impact for example a 5 percent reduction on 125 bushel per acre corn is much less important than a 5 percent reduction on 225 bushel per acre corn
6512152 this type of research offers growers sound agronomic advice on how to better manage their irrigation schedules
6512153 the research is particularly valuable to those who are impacted by declining water sources

6512169 last year the house passed its coast guard bill with the exemption for the delta queen included but the bill failed to pass the senate so lawmakers had to start over on the legislation this year
6512170 todd lindgren communications manager for u s rep steve chabot r 1st district said the waiver for the delta queen had been attached to a coast guard re authorization bill when the proposed legislation was sent to the house committee on transportation and infrastructure but when the bill emerged from the committee the waiver for the boat had been deleted lindgren said the full house has not yet acted on the bill
6512171 majestic america line announced today that despite tremendous efforts by the company many esteemed partners and thousands of previous guests the u s congress has decided that the delta queen should not continue operating on americas rivers beyond 2008

6512281 small businesses are the backbone of our economy creating new jobs while developing innovative products and services
6512282 having a dream is enough to get your business started but to find success entrepreneurs must build a strong financial foundation and establish their presence on the web
6512283 our goal is to provide entrepreneurs with the easiest to use business management tools and resources available so they can clear these hurdles
6512284 starting a small business is the american dream but keeping your books in order can be a nightmare
6512285 i speak on behalf of cincinnatis smallest enterprises and job creators when i say that this opportunity to receive free software and training is invaluable to entrepreneurs

6512287 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6512288 its the greatest feeling its my first olympics and my first olympic gold medal
6512289 the more minutes together the better we played and ive been working for nine months now with this team and it was about finding the rhythm and in the way we believed in attack
6512290 it is a hard moment i dont know what to say
6512291 it was not a lack of opportunities but rather it was a lack of patience on the one shot the usa had they scored and whoever scores the goal wins we lost focus after the americans scored

6512302 i think its a sad day for anybody who has any affinity or relationship or caring about anything with the nfl because really i think when you step back and take a look at this the nfl will never be the same
6512303 gene for people with their opinions or whatever that they have about him there has been a lot of stability and there has been a lot of improvements that have happened especially for players i think ultimately it has really benefited the league
6512304 you want to try to project forward but the reality is youre not promised
6512305 that really hits home for me personally my father is the exactly same age as gene upshaw he was born the same year
6512306 so when im looking at born 1945 deceased 2008 thats my father literally exactly the same age for me personally i want to call my dad and say i love you because you dont know

6512309 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6512310 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6512311 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6512312 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6512313 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about
6512314 theres plenty of agenda items but theres not much substance in them

6512319 the guards suspected the animal might be involved in drug smuggling once they noticed four prisoners visibly intoxicated shortly after the pigeon landed on a prison window
6512320 we suspect that the pigeon carried the drugs from tuzla

6512333 one of the things that this market has been missing is a real panic
6512334 if we were to see an actual failure a nationalization some kind of take under deal if we were to see something like that and we were to get some panic in the short term in the long term that would be helpful to clear out those sellers that are left
6512335 unless we find a way to continue fannie mae and freddie mac in their current form we dont have a mortgage market
6512336 didnt last because what weve been having here is this ongoing period of mini crisis followed by mini bailout then a few months of calm then the next crisis
6512337 the credit markets are much larger much more integrated this is a real deleveraging situation
6512338 the lehman brothers situation is extremely disturbing because theyre trying to shop one of their most profitable assets to stay in business
6512339 if you sell your most profitable asset youre not going to stay in business youre just buying time
6512340 i suspect that this offers a tremendous buying opportunity for the markets
6512341 its the sort of crash the sort of failure that you see that tends to market bottoms
6512342 we need to get it so the big sores are fixed
6512343 we know theres no real bottom yet in the securities business
6512344 but it is the day to day chaos that needs to be put to rest before we even find anything like terra firma
6512345 the sec gave us a chance to catch our breath by not allowing such a quick demise of institutions at the hands of aggressive shorting that ruins confidence
6512346 now its the dead of summer with no one around but the shorts to push stocks down we are staring at the abyss of lehman

6512356 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6512357 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6512358 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6512359 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6512360 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6512361 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6512362 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6512363 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6512364 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6512365 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6512366 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6512367 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6512368 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6512369 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6512370 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6512371 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6512372 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6512373 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6512374 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6512375 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6512376 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6512377 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6512378 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6512379 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6512380 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6512381 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6512382 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6512383 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6512384 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6512385 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6512386 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6512387 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6512388 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6512389 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6512390 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6512391 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6512392 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6512393 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6512394 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6512395 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6512396 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6512397 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6512398 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6512399 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6512400 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6512401 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6512402 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6512403 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6512404 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6512405 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6512406 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6512407 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6512408 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6512409 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6512410 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6512411 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6512412 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6512413 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6512414 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6512415 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6512416 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6512417 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6512418 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6512419 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6512420 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6512421 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6512422 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6512423 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6512424 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6512425 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6512426 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6512427 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6512428 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6512429 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6512430 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6512431 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6512432 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6512433 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6512434 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6512435 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6512436 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6512437 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6512438 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6512439 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6512440 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6512441 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6512442 join my blog tips newsletter and get a free copy of my
6512443 ive been advised by pistolas fc medical staff to not play for a month
6512444 which really means i hope to be back august 31st for the playoffs
6512445 i hope we can get at least 14 or 15 guys simply because we need the substitutions so that those playing on both days dont exhaust themselves on the saturday
6512446 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
6512447 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all
6512448 of course our concern is for him and that he doesnt risk further injury but im sure eddy knows his body well and will know exactly how much he can give or whether or not he needs to rest speaking on behalf of the team i can say were all ecstatic to have him back
6512449 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6512450 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6512451 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6512452 its true to say we have one or two areas that we need to look at defensively and maybe solve a few problems at the back
6512453 its the same as what weve been saying up until now theres no difference to that theres no news on that
6512454 ill look at the team ill wait until the last training session see how everyone is in training and then ill make a decision
6512455 hes an excellent pro as hes been working totally independently from anything that might be happening outside of football
6512456 i think any speculation that you refer to have been handled by his agent hes just been getting on with things professionally in his training
6512457 hes our player hes at our club hes a fantastic player so it would be great for him to stay
6512458 the minister asked the concerned countries to employ their ties with israel and international forums to urge it to stop taking any unilateral measure in jerusalem that could change its legal status including the planned construction of a bridge at magharebah gate
6512459 rejected such a unilateral step because it runs counter to the relevant un resolutions which consider east jerusalem an occupied city
6512460 remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs
6512461 so i remain optimistic that we will be able to be successful in this process
6512462 his rejection of such indiscriminate and reprehensible acts of terrorism and extends his condolences to the families of the victims and to the government of pakistan
6512463 if youre 31 and fancy a bit of champions league its difficult for us to compete with that
6512464 i have just been told that arsenal are interested as well but my position is clear i want to start the season with everton
6512465 what rennes are currently offering me is far behind my demands both clubs have to find an agreement to help me leave
6512466 im aware that my directors have declared i wont leave but its just a means to make my price higher i understand their position and i would do the same
6512467 its politics regarding what ive heard i know general manager pierre dreossi is ready to let me leave from my part i dont want to play for rennes anymore
6512468 personally i dont worry because english clubs have the resources to sign me when they really want a player they are ready to spent whatever amount
6512469 im hopeful it will be done by next week that kind of opportunity only happens once everton offer me 1 5 million 1 2 million whereas i dont earn the half of it at rennes
6512470 even if i owe everything to this club rennes i have a family to feed regardless the challenge which is very interesting
6512471 i was gobsmacked when he took the shirt and signed it
6512472 if i was one of berbatovs team mates or a fan id be furious it is incredibly disrespectful he may as well have kissed the united badge
6512473 he clearly wants to leave if he doesnt want to stay they should get rid of him

6512485 for months al franken has avoided answering questions about back taxes owed to other states prior to 2003 with his accountant being instructed not to speak to the press now that franken seems to have lifted the gag order on his accountant the republican party of minnesota will be offering a prize to anyone who can get al franken or his accountant to explain where specifically franken earned income and where he paid taxes from 1991 2003
6512486 in financial disclosure forms that franken filed last year with the u s senate he listed a salary of just over 1 million from alan franken inc the corporation set up in 1991 provides frankens services and collects fees and residuals for his work
6512487 contacted at his long island apartment chanzis declined to discuss frankens statements that the accountants mistakes caused frankens taxes to go unpaid in 17 states
6512488 meanwhile sheehan called on franken to make his accountant available to discuss frankens well documented tax problems franken paid 70 000 in back taxes to 17 states saying his accountant had reported the income elsewhere andy barr the franken spokesman said that franken has not instructed his accountant not to talk
6512489 franken said he would not release his income tax returns for those years he said he has filed for an extension on his 2007 taxes
6512490 al franken he gave speeches across the country says the announcer in the al franken for senate ad instead of paying taxes in the states where he spoke he overpaid taxes to the state where he lived it was an honest mistake in fact franken wont make tax returns public so theres no way to verify if he overpaid home state taxes he blames an accountants error for mistakenly paying 917 000 in taxes to new york and minnesota but he did not pay taxes due in 17 other states franken reimbursed those states with 70 000 and says he expects refunds at home

6512840 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6512841 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6512842 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6512843 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6512844 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6512845 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6512846 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6512847 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the
6512848 one of them was sen barack obama d ill who was offered a job by rezko in the early 1990s while a top student at harvard law school obama did not take it but over the years the two men stayed in touch
6512849 for the first time sen barack obama put a figure friday to the amount of campaign contributions that indicted political fund raiser tony rezko raised for the senators campaigns and the number about 250 000 was far more than he previously acknowledged
6512850 wed obama and rezko continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics wed talk about family
6512851 in terms of other than lunch or breakfast he and i had socially michelle and i probably had a couple of dinners or two or three dinners with rezko and his wife during the course of this six or seven or eight years

6512869 for the benefit of the town of macedon to establish a permanent location for the library
6512870 she was a kind lady super intelligent modest and caring who lived an honest life

6512873 we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6512874 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6512875 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6512876 as with everything else in small doses and done reasonably its effective and necessary
6512877 it just has to stop its gotten completely out of control
6512878 i am confident all can withstand the flashlight of public scrutiny
6512879 its going to be hard for him to fight against the general tide thats an uphill battle for all republicans nationwide and i think thats whats really bringing him down
6512880 i dont think theres any firing offense for sununu but its a tough year for republicans
6512881 he is a very accomplished ambitious young legislator so its not that hes done a bad job
6512882 its just that his party is having a very tough time and he has a very strong opponent
6512883 in some ways mr sununu has got many things going for him except that he is a republican at a time when theres this shift and no one knows ultimately how strong this shift will be
6512884 but if were playing the guessing game than yeah this race leans democrat
6512885 if mr sununu is the beneficiary of what were seeing in the presidential race a trend for this race to be close and for states to vote along traditional lines he probably has a chance to take himself out of the most endangered category
6512886 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute

6512914 in the wake of high fuel prices and a challenging economic environment we must continue to examine every aspect of our business and find new ways to improve our day to day operations through efficiencies that still meet our customers expectations
6512915 these are difficult but necessary changes we are looking at everything we need to do to offset fuel prices which are still skyrocketing
6512916 these moves are flat out stupid the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business

6512925 we are not going to renew it and that shouldnt come as a surprise to anybody
6512926 the reason for allowing the order to lapse is that i dont think it is necessary to create additional special categories or special rights

6512933 many georgia families are struggling now to make ends meet and raising property taxes by 300 during a tough economy is not the answer to dealing with georgias revenue shortfall democrats will do all we can to protect local property taxes and keep the homeowner relief grants in place
6512934 three hundred dollars is a lot of money to make families come up with who are trying to cover the cost of healthcare or send their children to college on a limited budget it does not make any sense and is plain wrong
6512935 raising property taxes right now is the last thing we should be doing
6512936 since 2003 the governor has cut 1 5 billion from our schools which has forced local property taxes to go up throughout the state eliminating the homeowner tax relief grants is another example of the governors complete disregard for homeowners and local governments
6512937 it is unfair to homeowners and local governments to eliminate the homestead exemption shifting the tax burden to the local level and blaming locally elected officials for his own fiscal irresponsibility is a pattern with this governor we must not let this happen
6512938 you cant balance the state budget on the backs of our mayors city councils and county commissions
6512939 these are tough times and we need to roll up our sleeves and work together and not point the finger at local governments
6512940 the police basically told me he had a shoe print on his face its disgusting i want the attacker done i want him charged

6512961 regulators had long classified a private swiss energy conglomerate called vitol as a trader that primarily helped industrial firms that needed oil to run their businesses
6512962 but when the commodity futures trading commission examined vitols books last month it found that the firm was in fact more of a speculator holding oil contracts as a profit making investment rather than a means of lining up the actual delivery of fuel even more surprising to the commodities markets was the massive size of vitols portfolio at one point in july the firm held 11 percent of all the oil contracts on the regulated new york mercantile exchange
6512963 but i just think getting help has become less taboo in my opinion people nowadays are less embarrassed to seek treatment
6512964 for the last year and a half one of our main efforts has been this anti stigma campaign
6512965 there are a lot of myths associated with mental illness that prevent them from getting help
6512966 people need to understand that this is an equal opportunity disease
6512967 anytime someone has journeyed your journey they can understand you in ways some professionals cant
6512968 diagnosing mental illness is a real art as well as a science everyone is different so we try to lend support and advocacy to whoever needs it

6512970 this is the first government report to present definitive conclusions that number one tobacco advertising and promotion are causally related to increased tobacco use in the population
6512971 and number two it shows that depictions of smoking in movies is causally related to youth smoking initiation
6512972 people living with mental illness have shouldered the burden of decades of cuts
6512973 there will be more people in the streets in the jails in the emergency rooms
6512974 we did not want to lose any ground in our hospitals
6512975 i think there is still conversation going back and forth
6512976 research shows that teacher quality is the most important in school factor affecting student learning improving teacher quality is the key to closing achievement gaps and enabling all students to succeed in todays more demanding economy
6512977 with teacher quality ranking so high on the list of voters concerns its good to see state policymakers paying so much attention to the issue this year with new programs for differential pay and an experiment in merit pay it will be equally important to consider additional changes including better training improved on the job evaluations that have consequences and incentives to draw teachers to hard to staff schools or programs
6512978 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6512979 here in the middle of the night the defendant officers decided to enter the residence of a person they knew to be seriously mentally disturbed
6512980 they did so despite an earlier directive from police superiors not to proceed in that matter
6512981 the family wanted him out of there he kicked the door to get in officers knew that
6512982 the family settled for 37 000 as far as im concerned this is a nuisance settlement
6512983 reviewed our investigation and it determined it was a justified homicide
6512984 during this conversation mr wood stated as he has several times in the past that he has no idea why he is being executed
6512985 indicates he is aware of his fate and is desperate to avoid it
6512986 i think george needs to be at atascadero state hospital i think he needs psychotropic medications to get rid of the voices so hes not distracted so we can make him competent obviously the jury did not feel the same way i do
6512987 if i cant have a discourse with him i cant do my job
6512988 our mission is just to observe and be sure he has a fair trial
6512989 you guys know its not fair you guys know that
6512990 but i cant imagine they wouldnt be relieved at this stage
6512991 i was bored and i was stressed and i was already thinking to shoot
6512992 thats an evil thought by an evil person but its a rational thought

6513017 he was already in rigor mortis when he was found
6513018 he had gone for several hours without being checked so it looks like they certainly werent doing what they said they were going to do

6513026 any guide dog signal dog or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability if they meet this definition animals are considered service animals under the ada regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government
6513027 a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity
6513028 people with type 1 definitely have a tough row to hoe
6513029 they truly have to walk a fine line all the time to maintain themselves
6513030 your request is not reasonable in light of the risk to public health safety and welfare and given no evidence that you cannot monitor your blood sugar levels absent the aid of a chimpanzee
6513031 you have provided insufficient evidence to show that juvenile diabetes meets the definition of quote disability close quote under the ada
6513032 my scent would change and he would wake me or andrew up or would just go to the refrigerator and get me sugar
6513033 the state of arizona may not want to believe it but its true both of my primates were and are capable of saving my life
6513034 he has a lot of learning to go if given the opportunity
6513035 most people should not own a primate it takes a very special person to own a primate and it should only be the people who are trained and financially can support them and physically support them and know exactly what theyre getting into
6513036 those unfamiliar with disabilities do not always understand the use of service animals besides seeing eye dogs for other disabilities this is especially true regarding the service animal needs of those with what i call hidden disabilities multiple sclerosis epilepsy diabetes deafness etc
6513037 i didnt know much about monkeys at first so i was a little nervous going out there
6513038 failed to modify their regulations policies or procedures as a reasonable accommodation to plaintiffs disability
6513039 game and fish told my client what she had to do to get her service chimp into this state legally she did what they told her to do so then they put criminal charges on her after she filed her lawsuit against them like i say very strange
6513040 we dont believe that people should own primates as pets or for any reason
6513041 this is a very good piece of legislation from where we sit
6513042 patchwork of laws regulatory loopholes and a thriving commercial trade in dangerous exotic animals
6513043 my own life has been enormously enriched by the close contact i have experienced with most of the common monkey species
6513044 is of special concern to me pet primates are not a documented source of disease to humans the housing that primate pet owners provide can equal and sometimes surpass that at zoos and is far superior to conditions in any research laboratory that i have visited
6513045 we truly feel that trained capuchins are appropriate to have as pets in the disabled community
6513046 told us that she intended to get a chimpanzee for use as a service animal and then she also said that she was within her rights under the americans with disabilities act and that she could have any animal she wanted and we needed to modify our regulations
6513047 all i wanted was to know what i was supposed to do in arizona jay cook told me what was needed and i did what i was told got the birth certificate vaccination records a letter from my doctors office about my diabetes and other stuff if joey was going to be illegal because of the restricted wildlife rule why did jay tell me to do all that
6513048 is a term used to describe uncontrolled type 1 diabetes people with brittle diabetes frequently experience large swings in blood sugar glucose levels
6513049 are often troubled by frequent medical problems and hospital admissions
6513050 they are inherently dangerous animals capable of transmitting disease and causing serious injury or death to human beings
6513051 if it determines that issuing a license is in the best interest of the wildlife it will not adversely impact other wildlife in the state and does not pose a threat to public health or safety
6513052 theres a threat to ms pruett herself in my mind
6513053 there have been a lot of ups and downs along the way
6513054 i havent been able to work for a long time and i cant get health insurance now because of my pre existing condition but ive been lucky in a lot of ways
6513055 he was a calm intelligent animal who took to training like nobodys business
6513056 honestly he saved my life or kept me from slipping into a coma or whatever many many times
6513057 told me that hes fallen in love with you this was even before andy died i could see that baby joey was smart as a whip and had been around people and was a very good little guy and we were already bonded from my visits out there
6513058 the training started right away but its a long and endless process
6513059 you get used to things and it becomes part of your life
6513060 i just need joey at my home when im alone it isnt that i want him to grow old here i just want him to be my service animal while hes living in my house i cant lead a normal life im dependent on food insulin and medical help at all times
6513061 have you ever read in any of your research that chimpanzees can bite off fingers
6513062 i am very very careful with who i allow to be around my primate and how he is with me a lot of the primates when you look at them theyre biters and i didnt want one i wasnt familiar with that i hadnt trained with i did not want to be fighting a biting monkey
6513063 but not while hes an infant he couldnt attack and hurt me
6513064 so youre putting your life in the hands of a chimpanzee
6513065 im asking him to go get me sugar and hes providing that for me
6513066 the problem with the phone is wherever you are you go dizzy
6513067 you go down to the ground you get wobbly you get faint when i have joey in my home and i tell him to go get sugar he gets me sugar within seconds
6513068 do you feel the state of arizona taxpayers should purchase the chimpanzee for you
6513069 i feel that the state of arizona should not have asked me to get rid of my service animal joey
6513070 i feel like the taxpayers money should not be fighting me on possessing my service animal
6513071 i made a lifetime commitment to that chimp when we bought him
6513072 and that means after he gets too big to be my service animal anymore and has to live somewhere else i just hope for a happy ending
6513073 for too long families in new hampshire and across the country have struggled as washington has put the needs of special interests ahead of the needs of middle class families well it is time for a change

6513089 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6513090 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6513091 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6513092 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6513093 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6513094 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6513095 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine

6513103 there is consideration for another special meeting of forum leaders by the end of the year to consider special measures consistent with the biketawa declaration
6513104 the mcgs report should include recommendations taking into account practice in the commonwealth and other relevant organisations on further measures the forum should take to promote compliance by the interim government for en election in march

6513110 i learned a lot over the year that i battled this dreaded disease i learned that it is not in our best interest to hold out expectations to god he is not santa clause he does what is right and good this was my path my journey in this world was difficult and painful but important in my spiritual growth i learned that we have to be happy despite our circumstances we cant say i will be happy when no sweeties be happy now because today is all you have i learned that all the small stuff is very small and not worth your time and attention gossip and resentments worrying about things that never happen fearing the unknown let it go my lovelies breath and just be good to each other i realized not long after my diagnosis that life is too short to spend it hurting people and holding onto the anger we have for those around us i am no doormat but i just let go of all that hard core resentment god forgives us through the blood of his son he forgives those who hurt us as well
6513111 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6513112 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6513113 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along

6513117 it has never been done in the pacific and i dont think our pacific neighbours want to bring fiji to its knees
6513118 we have to follow a process we cant just make preemptive decisions before fiji is given the option to hear us out
6513119 whats important is to send out a very strong statement to fiji on the credibility and integrity of the forum

6513121 i would like to be longer at the grounds but the rain just spoils everything so we will head off to home early
6513122 the selective use of the biketawa declaration is not only inappropriate but goes against the very basic principle of inclusiveness and dialogue which is integral to the pacific way
6513123 so far we have managed to collect just 28 pints of blood which is very low but we will try our best to reach our target we kindly ask the people to step forward to support this good cause

6513127 its going to be a great challenge for the tikina reps especially the changes to the electoral system which the villagers and the general public are used to
6513128 even i am not finding it easy to fully understand the new changes to the electoral system so it is important that i understand it first before i go out and inform the tikina members
6513129 a library front desk staff simione kuruvoli was removed from his position on may 5 for serious office misconduct the matter was then referred to the usp disciplinary committee which is supposed to resolve the matter within 28 days
6513130 that was a failure on their part as to date it has been 108 days and the matter is still unresolved
6513131 we even warned them yesterday wednesday that we would go on strike if they failed to reinstate our member we have followed everything according to the law and according to our agreement with usp
6513132 after that he has been unemployed for months without any money he is a married man with two children and we are concerned about his and his familys future
6513133 they presented to us in writing that mr kuruvoli will be reinstated and he will start work from tomorrow today
6513134 we went to the farm and found about 20 plants which were around 12 17cm long
6513135 i have demanded they come forward with some proof to justify my being sacked but they have not been able to do that and that is why i am so angry
6513136 i am consulting with my lawyer on this issue and may sue the resort
6513137 sometimes we did not have the work tools that we needed and sometimes there were no necessary ingredients and when the guests made some requests that we could not fulfill because of the lack of resources we had to lie to them
6513138 we got tired of doing that because we helped built the resort to its five star status we are all behind the resort but its the management tactics that we dont agree with
6513139 in our letters it was stated that the fact they did not support management meant their attitudes were incompatible with the terms of their contract
6513140 once the offender has served their punishment they should be treated equally as other citizens
6513141 community and society believes that unless we show this positive attitude to them then they are likely to feel very isolated as if nobody cares for them
6513142 people dont think you can shoot tv outside of new york and l a
6513143 the decision to move our sole base of manufacturing operations from cranston to denham springs was based on what we found to be a more competitive business climate in louisiana
6513144 we are enthusiastic about the direction in which louisiana is heading and we want to be a part of it
6513145 this recognition is a strong indication that the capital region is doing things right in business development
6513146 were going to hire four people here and two people in houston over the next 30 days
6513147 we are skilling local staff with international standard training for handling modern aircraft and supporting improvements to safety and security procedures
6513148 we have created very competitive airfares and flight connections to and from australia and new zealand with travel conveniently arranged on one ticket right here in funafuti
6513149 it can be attributed to more improvements in operational efficiencies highly focused and aggressive marketing and the continued introduction of new products and services
6513150 the outcome has enabled directors to recommend a record total dividend of nine cents per share or 37 989 719 50 per cent up on 2007 he said
6513151 there are many opportunities to grow our enterprise and ath is confident it can capitalise on them
6513152 what we are now witnessing in a market in transition is an unprecedented level of energy and innovation triggered by the many opportunities that have been created
6513153 that day i was just so happy that life was behind me i wanted to make a new beginning be a better person but every day i was reminded that at one point in my life i was a criminal
6513154 children would call my daughter and son offspring of a criminal your father is a kaivesu they would say and i knew it hurt sometimes they would cry
6513155 i also got my fair share of cold stares and sniggering but i am tougher than that and i know that kind of attitude does not deserve a second thought so i just ignore it and focused on the good things like my family
6513156 i was shocked i didnt believe my sentence my family flashed before my eyes and i knew our lives would change forever
6513157 my children grew up without me when my six year old son visited me in prison thinking i was still a soldier he would ask me where our guns were id tell him that the only weapon in prison was the bible and our digging forks were out tools
6513158 its not easy being the child of an ex con somehow the community treats them differently from the other children they seem to be valued less so in the end they also pay the price of our crime
6513159 there are many young men who end up again in prison because when they get out they are rejected by their communities who are always judging them and measuring their lives by their bad deeds of the past
6513160 all we all want is to leave the past behind and start anew no one need remind us of the mistakes we made that is something we can hardly forget
6513161 theyll have to have a one to one with their family then the church and then community
6513162 they would also start to understand that there are people that care for them
6513163 when the prisoner got out and mended his relationship with his family i brought him to the church and introduced him to the congregation
6513164 to let people know he had served his sentence and he was no more the person he used to be but a new man
6513165 i think the government should seriously consider the problem of ex prisoners finding employment
6513166 they have the right to be part of the community they should start putting up some laws for employers and companies not to reject these people
6513167 why does he or she need to suffer twice when they have served their punishment
6513168 if a company has a contract for employee care we will be flexible in our scheduling to accommodate out clients
6513169 we will have the latest state of the art digital x ray machine it will be the only one in the county
6513170 i have made a commitment to bring top of the line care to the community
6513171 we think we will continue to see a domino effect from this project
6513172 with danas continued effort the city can only blossom from there there is an emphasis and a commitment to hire people from within the community and further identify markets where there is a need
6513173 we will be hiring about 10 to 13 people as they will be working in shifts
6513174 we will also have some part time physicians that may be emergency department doctors from other facilities
6513175 gateway will bring a diversification of employment base as well as meeting service demands requested by the community health needs assessment
6513176 we will accept most of the fehb plans for government workers as well as most commercial insurances
6513177 we will also participate with medicare medicaid tricare and chips
6513178 the community still has a need for more medical services
6513179 and it was my goal to erect a structure where the full range of medical professionals could provide for the needs of the local citizens
6513180 the program is set up to enable specialists to utilize our facility and our staff
6513181 all they have to do is bring themselves and their nurse
6513182 this kind of imposed deadline clearly violates the principles of free collective bargaining
6513183 and we will leave no stone unturned to see what the legal implications are
6513184 we do not issue idle threats nor do we heat our members up unnecessarily
6513185 but we will be monitoring school boards over the next three weeks to see if they show signs of being willing to start bargaining some issues locally
6513186 the officer told katherine to pick up the butt and throw it away in the trash 10 feet away
6513187 he added that hed fine her next time he catches her tossing trash on the sidewalk
6513188 mark street is a very busy place and there are people standing on the street selling stuff like gold chains and rings and phones
6513189 but they did not take any statements or checked for evidence or anything they came back the next morning and we thought they would take statements so that we could clear the mess and continue with our work
6513190 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6513191 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have different perspective
6513192 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6513193 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6513194 the church will work with the ministry of health and the vanua on the alleviation of hiv aids
6513195 they want to sell their home which is why it is offered for sale
6513196 why yes they are willing to sell for pennies on the dollar
6513197 are they willing to take less because of all the short sales
6513198 avec fadela amara nous marchons main dans la main car une grande partie de la politique de lint gration concerne la politique de la ville

6513201 the accused submits he is entitled to the presumption of innocence this however does not mean that the court has to be satisfied of the guilt of the accused before the bail is refused
6513202 i also take into account the allegation in this case arose whilst the accused was on bail i am satisfied that there is a real possibility of the accused committing an arrestable offence while on bail
6513203 i am satisfied that the prosecution has rebutted the presumption in favour of bail on balance of probability
6513204 two or three years ago i think the assumption was many if not most people would be upgrading to new generations of laptops and desktop systems much more quickly than they have been
6513205 but the last generation of chips was very very powerful i think powerful enough for the vast majority of the applications most people use
6513206 the history of these sorts of things in terms of how theyll pay off has always been speculative and its been cyclical
6513207 one of the characteristics about seinfeld that gives him credibility in this matter is that hes always been somewhat of a cynic
6513208 hes always been the doubter always questioning the ethics of american society and business we do recognize that hes being paid for this but at least hes got that credibility
6513209 jerry seinfeld is not going to rescue a product that has true problems if its not a competitive product if it continues to dissatisfy the public jerry seinfelds not going to do any good for it
6513210 but if the product starts to get favorable word of mouth theres a synergy i would assume microsoft is looking for synergy here they obviously feel its a good product otherwise they wouldnt be investing this kind of effort in it
6513211 making the inc 5000 is a great honor for us
6513212 weve been working hard on expanding our offering for current and prospective customers so they can visit the site and consider it a one stop shop for all their wireless needs this recognition of our quick growth shows that fommy com is continuing to build itself into one of the leading wireless distributors on the web
6513213 the increasing popularity of mobile phones makes a one stop shop for individual parts and accessories more attractive
6513214 ceo and founder pinakin dinesh is originally from india and moved to the united states seven years ago
6513215 we upgraded to e2campus because it gives us a centralized interface to broadcast emergency alerts to our campus pa system our web page and as sms text messages voice calls rss feeds and emails it helps us cover all our bases because e2campus automatically broadcasts to everyones email address and the pa system whether people have opted in or not their solid reputation and long history of reliability makes me feel confident we made the right choice with e2campus
6513216 e2campus allows asu to provide both emergency notifications to the asu community as well as other messages for a variety of campus services this kind of flexibility becomes increasingly important as the population of college communities like asu become progressively mobile
6513217 we have received numerous calls from colleges and universities that want to upgrade to e2campus because we require recipients to opt in to receive alerts these schools were concerned about going through the collection process again with our new ens conversion service clients can now import data from their existing ens into e2campus free of charge
6513218 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6513219 its just unlike any other closing ceremony ive ever seen
6513220 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6513221 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6513222 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6513223 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals there have been what i would call some minimal movements to date
6513224 there was also community policing looking at critical issues prevalent in society where pastors could play an important role in communities they live in

6513226 many people or leaders talk about drunkenness young people going to clubs and doing drugs when they are getting drunk themselves from kava
6513227 i spoke to the pastors and the youths on why we have a lot of problems in fiji today
6513228 these are issues like unwanted pregnancies broken families glue sniffing poverty and others we discussed and found that fiji has to go back and be ruled by the word of the lord
6513229 we are not here to force other people to come and join us
6513230 those in leadership should honour and respect the god given resources that we have it is good to have technology and education but that will not resolve the problems that we face today
6513231 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery

6513243 ever cheaper fashion is like cheap food it means peoples lives and the environment are being violated

6513265 as the internet continues to unsettle the economics of the news business the long career of my old friend is a witness to the traditional values of rural and community journalism
6513266 he still does it the old fashioned way getting up before dawn with the farmers and factory workers to tell them what the weather will be like what happened in their county yesterday and what might happen today
6513267 guests might be an author on the line from louisville or new york about a new novel or a vanderbilt university divinity school professor discussing pentecostalism in south america or as on an especially memorable morning one of western kentucky university s aging hilltoppers helping don spin their music that went gold in the fifties an avid book reader a longtime library trustee and married to a former teacher dons passion for reading compensated for whatever he missed as a college dropout but his learning rests easily in the folksy good humored chatter of a man who can talk to anybody
6513268 don has managed to exploit new technology to keep his little media business profitable but much of his success is still so very personal the dependable service that long ago forged a bond between a rural american community and its self taught but experienced news guy he feels the pressures of his business interests compromise his time to do quality news after he leaves he is not sure what will happen or who will care as much

6513337 we need a plan for breaking up fannie and freddie and selling them to private investors so that the government isnt the biggest backer of the housing market
6513338 the government better get a heck of a good guy to run fannie and freddie
6513339 for all practical purposes fannie and freddie are nationalized but the government doesnt have enough control given its interest in the housing market
6513340 this process needs to be done in an overt rather than covert fashion so that market participants know what the rules are
6513341 if the government wants to provide a subsidy why not just give it directly to borrowers and get dollar for dollar on its money

6513347 fannie and freddie are private institutions that had special privileges in the marketplace which forced competitors out of business

6513371 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6513372 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6513373 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6513374 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6513375 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6513376 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces

6513503 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6513504 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent

6513518 setelah itu saya baru meningkatkan permainan karena sangat ingin menang
6513519 saya terlalu takut kalah di set keempat sehingga permainan saya jadi tidak menentu saya kehilangan kepercayaan diri
6513520 saya tidak terkejut karena seperti beberapa kali pernah saya katakan china akan sukses pada olimpiade kali ini amerika serikat memang unggul dalam total medali tetapi berdasarkan jumlah emas china yang unggul
6513521 di samping itu china memiliki dua aset yang bisa mendorong mereka terus berprestasi yaitu jumlah penduduk dan faktor finansial china telah menjadi negara superpower dalam ekonomi
6513522 gedung gedung yang digunakan sebagai tempat pertandingan juga pasti terpakai setelah olimpiade ini usai karena banyak yang terletak di sekitar kampus
6513523 kami meminta federasi tiap cabang olahraga untuk melakukan tes sebelum olimpiade dimulai terutama untuk cabang angkat besi hasilnya 39 atlet dinyatakan positif doping yang sebagian besar di antaranya berasal dari yunani dan rusia itu artinya ada 39 kecurangan yang bisa dicegah sebelum olimpiade
6513524 setelah 10 tahun latihan kami akhirnya mendapat medali pertama pada olimpiade kami merasa seperti menjadi orang paling beruntung di sini
6513525 kami telah memenangi kejuaraan kejuaraan dan regata perlombaan perahu layar tetapi ini kemenangan terpenting dari semuanya itu
6513526 kondisi cuaca benar benar sulit hari ini dan kami merasa agak gugup
6513527 kami sempat tertahan saat start dan kami terpaksa parkir dulu
6513528 putaran tiang kami pecah dan itu sebenarnya tidak ada masalah jika kecepatan angin hanya 5 knot atau kurang namun angin di luar sana benar benar kencang
6513529 inggris tidak berdaya tanpa tujuan dan tidak punya harapan secara taktik inggris sangat semrawut dan menggelikan
6513530 pemain dibayar terlalu mahal dan selama ini sangat dimanjakan mereka harus mencontoh atlet atlet inggris yang kini berlaga di olimpiade beijing
6513531 kami bermain terlalu lamban dan tidak kreatif di babak pertama
6513532 denmark bermain baik sekali di babak pertama dan mereka menyulitkan kami namun kami berhasil keluar dari tekanan di babak kedua dan akhirnya memperoleh tiga gol
6513533 saya sangat gembira menang di olimpiade merupakan sesuatu yang sangat sulit
6513534 sebelum lomba saya bercanda dengan pelatih saya bahwa di athena saya finis ke 12 mungkin nanti di beijing saya akan finis pertama atau kedua saya memulai karier olimpiade dengan perak dan menutupnya juga dengan perak
6513535 saya merasa sangat kecewa taktik saya tadi memang tidak stabil saya merasa baik baik saja tetapi saya ternyata mendapat kartu merah dari juri saya minta maaf saya mengecewakan semua orang yang mendukung saya
6513536 saya mulai berlatih jalan cepat sejak 10 tahun lalu namun baru empat tahun terakhir saya berlatih dengan serius
6513537 tidak ada saudara yang menggeluti jalan cepat mereka aktif dalam olahraga tetapi tidak di cabang atletik saudara laki laki saya adalah pemain gulat paman saya menjadi petinju
6513538 setelah memikirkannya dalam waktu lama aku memilih mengumumkan bahwa dengan adanya staf teknis perancis saat ini aku memutuskan untuk mencurahkan seluruh waktuku untuk fiorentina aku tidak ingin semua ini terdengar seperti tidak menghormati pelatih saat ini tapi sungguh aku tidak ingin menjadi pemain pilihannya
6513539 hujan menjadikannya lebih baik kami merasa seperti pejuang di lapangan tekanan di sini lebih berat dan nyata dari athena karena kami juara bertahan namun kami bisa mengalahkan pasangan china di kandang mereka sendiri dalam kondisi yang sulit
6513540 sulit melihat bola saat melambung tinggi namun kami tak mau mencari alasan kekalahan karena mereka juga disiram hujan yang sama
6513541 sejak menang di athena kami sudah bertekad untuk mengulangnya di beijing belum pernah ada yang melakukan ini sebelumnya
6513542 mereka lebih baik dari kami mereka lebih berpengalaman dan kuat namun kami sudah menciptakan sejarah pada olimpiade beijing ini ini hasil terbaik yang bisa kami peroleh
6513543 target kami memang memperoleh pengalaman internasional menang atau kalah pengalaman itu yang paling penting apalagi tim kami menang
6513544 mereka masih muda harus memanfaatkan peluang dengan baik kalau perlu kami akan bermain agresif
6513545 kami bisa bicara kepada rakyat kuba bahwa mereka bisa memercayai kemampuan tim tinju kuba kali ini meski pascahengkangnya sejumlah petinju andalan dari tim ini petinju kuba tidak akan mengecewakan
6513546 seluruh tim memikirkan apa yang sedang terjadi di georgia saya berharap segera diberi kedamaian
6513547 kami berusaha menghentikan dia tetapi ia selalu bisa mencetak gol
6513548 saya berharap mereka berdua akan tampil tuntas sehingga bisa memberikan prestasi yang terbaik dari yang mereka miliki
6513549 kami ingin melihat bagaimana hasil pembinaan selama pembalap dilatih di racing academy

6513650 as a result of weak demand in the u s and lower imports the demand for oil declined and that led to a tightening of global liquidity which led to the strong dollar
6513651 relatively speaking the u s economy is in better shape because of the weak dollar

6513658 the study was based on tests of about 11 000 people in britain who were tested for hand control co ordination and clumsiness at age seven and 11 and were then followed until age 33

6513660 while it is often assumed that the cognitive impairments seen in adult obesity are a consequence of excess weight that could be putting the chicken before the egg the researchers say
6513661 the main message of cognitive therapy overall and its application in the diet world is straight forward problems losing weight are not ones fault problems simply reflect lack of skills skills that can be acquired and mastered through practice dieters who read the book or workbook learn a new cognitive or behavioral skill every day for six weeks they practice some skills just once they automatically incorporate others for their lifetime
6513662 that is exactly my goal to show how everyone can learn some critical skills the key ones are
6513663 1 how to motivate oneself the first task that dieters do is to write a list of the 15 of 20 reasons why they want to lose weight and read that list every single day
6513664 2 plan in advance and self monitor behavior a typical reason for diet failure is a strong preference for spontaneity i ask people to prepare a plan and then i teach them the skills to stick to it
6513665 3 overcome sabotaging thoughts dieters have hundreds and hundreds of thoughts that lead them to engage in unhelpful eating behavior i have dieters read cards that remind them of key points e g that it isnt worth the few moments of pleasure theyll get from eating something they hadnt planned and that theyll feel badly afterwards that they cant eat whatever they want whenever they want in whatever quantity they want and still be thinner that the scale is not supposed to go down every single day that they deserve credit for each helpful eating behavior they engage in to name just a few
6513666 4 tolerate hunger and craving overweight people often confuse the two you experience hunger when your stomach feels empty craving is an urge to eat usually experienced in the mouth or throat even if your stomach is full

6513699 our department of commerce has been hearing complaints and questions about the application of prevailing wage laws in very specific circumstances
6513700 were reviewing these circumstances to ensure that were adhering to the law
6513701 an expansion of prevailing wage could be one of those things that keeps us off initial lists
6513702 i think it would have something of a chilling effect on our development efforts
6513703 wrap up the story lines with a movie like they did with

6513711 automatic mental associations predict future choices of undecided decision makers
6513712 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture
6513713 a better understanding of the sensory world of the child and the scientific basis for distaste and how to ameliorate it is a public health priority
6513714 the number one reason for non compliance among children when taking medicine or eating vegetables is that they dont like the taste
6513715 just look at a childs face when theyre eating some of these things
6513716 bitter taste is a sensation that evolved to make you not want to ingest something
6513717 it is interesting because it may suggest that children have heightened bitter sensitivity compared to adults
6513718 we find that the more a mother eats fruits when shes pregnant the more a child will accept fruits and vegetables
6513719 in england there is a lot of lemon flavor added to childrens medicine its a cultural phenomenon bubblegum and cherry are popular in the united states
6513720 it is one of the fundamental mysteries of human behavior why do we grow to like these foods and flavors that we initially rejected

6513722 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6513723 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6513724 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6513725 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6513726 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6513727 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6513728 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine

6513735 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like
6513736 and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6513737 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6513738 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6513739 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6513740 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
6513741 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture

6513950 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6513951 because of the increased cost of living particularly the price of gas and the burden that puts on our faculty and staff we want the option to consider a four day work week or some sort of flex time
6513952 in order to do that we need a regents rule that would allow the campus to create policies for shorter work weeks by the number of days not number of hours as our employees would still be required to work at least a 40 hour work week

6513969 the study was based on tests of about 11 000 people in britain who were tested for hand control co ordination and clumsiness at age seven and 11 and were then followed until age 33
6513970 prof scott montgomery of the karolinska institutet in stockholm and his colleagues at imperial college london in england said they purposely chose measurements of fine hand control such as picking up matches rather than those likely to be influenced by participating in sports such as catching balls
6513971 while it is often assumed that the cognitive impairments seen in adult obesity are a consequence of excess weight that could be putting the chicken before the egg the researchers say
6513972 the main message of cognitive therapy overall and its application in the diet world is straight forward problems losing weight are not ones fault problems simply reflect lack of skills skills that can be acquired and mastered through practice dieters who read the book or workbook learn a new cognitive or behavioral skill every day for six weeks they practice some skills just once they automatically incorporate others for their lifetime
6513973 that is exactly my goal to show how everyone can learn some critical skills the key ones are
6513974 1 how to motivate oneself the first task that dieters do is to write a list of the 15 of 20 reasons why they want to lose weight and read that list every single day
6513975 2 plan in advance and self monitor behavior a typical reason for diet failure is a strong preference for spontaneity i ask people to prepare a plan and then i teach them the skills to stick to it
6513976 3 overcome sabotaging thoughts dieters have hundreds and hundreds of thoughts that lead them to engage in unhelpful eating behavior i have dieters read cards that remind them of key points e g that it isnt worth the few moments of pleasure theyll get from eating something they hadnt planned and that theyll feel badly afterwards that they cant eat whatever they want whenever they want in whatever quantity they want and still be thinner that the scale is not supposed to go down every single day that they deserve credit for each helpful eating behavior they engage in to name just a few
6513977 4 tolerate hunger and craving overweight people often confuse the two you experience hunger when your stomach feels empty craving is an urge to eat usually experienced in the mouth or throat even if your stomach is full
6513978 we have no reason to believe that money changed hands but its quite possible
6513979 we are an orthodox burial society which is bound by the halachic regulations as relating to all aspects of jewish burial and jewish services
6513980 we have had meetings with representatives of the reform shul it is an ongoing issue
6513981 there has been a long standing practice and agreement which they the hebrew burial society appear to have changed very recently but we sincerely hope that they will revert back to the practice as it has been for many years
6513982 if the deceased was a member of the glasgow reform synagogue i was allowed to conduct the ceremony and was treated with due respect no questions were asked everything went smoothly
6513983 i preferred to be as close to the mourners as possible
6513984 we are a small community here the members of the reform synagogue pay their dues to the representative council and support all the charitable organisations in glasgow
6513985 we should not create a deeper ravine than we already have with the reform

6513989 supernatural things really scare me i saw a picture of a ghost when i was younger and it was very creepy and very graphic i definitely believe theres something else out there
6513990 until now i naively believed that self destructive doomsday machines were fictional devices found only in james bond movies i never believed that anyone would actually create and activate one in real life i guess i never knew about yang and the yahoo board
6513991 every act of creation is at first an act of destruction

6514004 no really we actually do have a plan for wireless and that plan is to make money the details of the plan have yet to be finalized in fact truth be told there are no details as of yet the whole plan consists of using wireless to make money
6514005 and besides figuring out the details is below my pay grade im paid to lead not read
6514006 but the point is that cox along with the rest of the cable and satellite industry will definitely make money on wireless
6514007 and nevermind about pivot that joint venture with sprint nextel we were just trying to psyche everyone out with that service psyche psyche double psyche see we never intended to make any money from that
6514008 but starting today were going to make money from wireless were going to offer content and services over both wireline and wireless connections and well capture 20 of the wireless market at some point in the future
6514009 your articles are complete garbage my only true question for you is who hired youre a to write these meaningless waste of times ive blown around 5 10 mins of my life reading through a couple or your bios ridiculous articles and to be honest i want it back quit your job and throw some news papers around im sure people would appreciate that more over
6514010 the attachable plan must be bought in conjunction with any one of three domestic or two global data plans for pdas smartphones customers still have to shell out 45 85 a month on top of a monthly voice plan and it may still boost sprints overall revenues before this pam was 49 99 standalone with no base plan requirements
6514011 im inconsolable i was a very good friend of jordan he was probably the greatest basketball player this country has ever seen
6514012 is there any reason why x decided not to contribute towards httpush whisker rfproxy elza stake webproxy or another established tool that already does this
6514013 its time to put aside the failed policies of the past and start moving in a new direction by encouraging companies like iberdrola to locate here and making the necessary investments that will grow this industry
6514014 instead some psc members have taken a decidedly hostile view toward this project which i find baffling we are poised to become a world class leader in the field of wind generation both in terms of actual energy production and the businesses that serve them iberdrola has made significant upgrades to this deal its time for the psc to get on board
6514015 reporters or city officials and their staff members may simply not have time to head back to their hotels to file stories or transmit important information to each other
6514016 by subscribing to our wimax service theyll receive high speed wireless internet access directly from the convention center with the same kind of connectivity theyd get with their own networks at the office
6514017 cutting down trees in a sustainable harvested forest which is what we draw our supply from is just like taking out corn or flowers and replanting them next year
6514018 from the hotels perspective this fits in very well with our recycling efforts our energy conservation
6514019 its something that is more sustainable than a typical plastic key we think its a great idea
6514020 there will soon be a big announcement and the hotel is going to be spectacular
6514021 it will be a four star four diamond hotel a beautiful hotel and we have the land and will break ground in december
6514022 these skulls and skeletons appeared to be old and are being sent for forensic examination
6514023 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6514024 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6514025 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6514026 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6514027 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6514028 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6514029 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6514030 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6514031 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6514032 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6514033 i was surprised to wake up this morning and read news of my own retirement while i am taking some time off currently to rest and enjoy the company of friends and family i am still very much a excited and enthusiastic working model and actress im only 20 for gods sakes
6514034 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6514035 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have different perspective
6514036 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6514037 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6514038 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6514039 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6514040 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6514041 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6514042 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6514043 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6514044 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6514045 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children

6514049 i have located or found a great grand master key some time ago yes

6514053 essa pe a libera mais o mastro deixa a vela mais redonda e potente no vento de empopada quando o barco anda a favor do vento nos testes ela sempre se mostrou eficiente e acho que ajudou um pouco mas claro que a parte psicol gica tamb m conta velejador valoriza muito isso
6514054 essas alavancas aliviam a press o dos arames e ajudaram muito a recuperar no vento a favor com certeza foi uma arma que ajudou bastante
6514055 foi desenvolvido na pr tica a gente sentiu a necessidade de ter uma alavanca como essa para aliviar a press o do mastro e acabou desenvolvendo essa pe a na verdade uma pe a padr o para outra coisa que n o era usada para esse fim acho que funcionou bastante bem

6514059 this conflict and this emergency situation has very negatively influenced tourism
6514060 w e are close to poti and we could hear when the explosions took place it was not very pleasant
6514061 no one knows what will happen today russian forces came to poti took some things and arrested people of course that scares people
6514062 we are not ready to close the hotel but if this continues we will have to close down
6514063 this kind of publicity worldwide will make your average non adventure tourist at least think twice before coming to georgia
6514064 i believe they tourists will come but it will take a long time to for tourism to recover
6514065 i t takes a while for that impression to die
6514066 but literally once russian soldiers are off georgian territory i think things will go back to normal very very quickly especially for tourism purposes its a pr game
6514067 for new delhi musharraf was seen as being very keen on sustaining the peace process between the two countries to moving forward in terms of the talks to really agreeing in many ways with india over what it saw as the key issues for example of building confidence between the two countries
6514068 so musharrafs departure for new delhi actually does raise some hopes in terms of a new democratic pakistan
6514069 but it also raises concerns over whether the new leadership in pakistan that makes decisions on relations with india will really want to move forward in terms of the peace process that musharraf clearly did want to do
6514070 you have of course the prime minister and the foreign minister but you also have the leaders of the two major coalition partners in the government the ppp and the plm n you also have in terms of foreign relations the army and the isi secret service which has a critical role for neighborhood policy issues and you have in some cases the judiciary as well in terms of the legal challenges to the regime and the impact of those challenges on foreign policy
6514071 i dont think its up to gilani in islamabad because whatever dealing india has with a country like pakistan and also whatever dealings pakistan has with afghanistan are determined and underwritten in a sense by the military
6514072 the pakistani military is the arbiter of deciding and calibrating the level of talks with india and the level of relations with india
6514073 but the army itself in pakistan is in a bit of turmoil because the army is anxious to remain in the back seat and not be very overt like with musharraf so in a sense pakistan is in a complete state of flux and chaos india is fairly low down on their radar
6514074 but india on the other hand is very concerned that because of the growth of turmoil inside pakistan india may become a target as a diversionary tactic by the pakistani military and the intelligence services so india has more to fear from chaos in pakistan than pakistan has to fear from the lack of progress in peace talks
6514075 india is a little tentative about dealing with the civilian government in islamabad because over the last three or four months the peace process that began in 2004 under president musharraf has been crumbling partially because of a series of serious bombings in india in which india has accused pakistan of being guilty of interference with its intelligence service and particularly because of the indian embassy bombing in kabul which india claimed along with the cia had been supported by the isi the pakistani spy agency
6514076 it really remains to be seen how they can organize themselves and take the peace process forward because the indian government was somewhat content to meet with musharraf in fact over the last three or four years they had made some progress in peace talks
6514077 what we have seen in the last few months is really a deterioration of relations between musharraf and karzai personally
6514078 the relationship between these two countries is far greater than the personality of their leaders there are a number of factors that will continue regarding the current policies of pakistan toward afghanistan
6514079 we have clearly concerns over what is happening in the tribal areas in pakistan and the implications in afghanistan
6514080 the afghans of course have raised this they have also threatened a more proactive military stance so i dont think there will be much of a change in terms of the actual relationship other than the fact that the differing personalities of the two will not really be there that does provide some potential for improvement in presentation at least but it is unlikely to see much of an improvement in substance
6514081 pakistan under musharraf was looking at the issue of islamic extremism in the context of its regional interests
6514082 so there was not always harmony or a common approach to extremism in the area now the civilian government the elected government of pakistan is facing that challenge
6514083 if the elected government of pakistan can stay united and respond to these challenges in a unified way and also control the interference of the isi intelligence services they might be able to respond in an effective way
6514084 otherwise the disunity among different factions in pakistans elected government can create a vacuum that vacuum can be exploited by the extremist groups they will have a free hand and expand their crossborder attacks into afghanistan
6514085 from washingtons perspective the trend that we are looking at more assertive policy both in terms of rhetoric and at times in terms of substance will continue
6514086 washington is going toward an election date very soon later this year so there will be more pressure for washington to deal firmly with pakistan
6514087 is that washington will have to broaden its contacts in pakistan the range of officials at a very senior level that washington has been dealing with now is far broader earlier it was fairly safe to deal largely only with musharraf today that is not the case so there are more complexities and concerns
6514088 the current round of agitation in kashmir for the first time in almost two decades has nothing really to do with pakistan
6514089 it is purely a home grown problem which is very complicated over the transfer of land to hindus in the kashmir valley which is muslim dominated but the agitations that are going on in kashmir are definitely disturbing because they are pro pakistan indian planners believe that pakistan is in such turmoil that it cannot really take advantage of indias vulnerability in kashmir but it is only a matter of time before that situation changes and indias confrontation over kashmir with pakistan begins all over again

6514109 once preseason is over i think its almost like another switch is turned off and another one turned on
6514110 to tell you the truth before the young guys got here and started pushing us like they have i told myself i was next in line and was settling for just being second team
6514111 these young guys are a lot better than i expected and theyre not only pushing me to keep my spot theyre motivating me to try to get on the field as a starter
6514112 if they come back to the port they just come back

6514116 every year we experience importation of measles from other countries and from those going abroad but this year is different once measles is imported here were seeing it spread to many more people
6514117 many cases are in children who are eligible for vaccination but who have not been immunized because of parents decisions
6514118 we need very high levels of population immunity approximately 95 percent
6514119 we have been lucky to have low levels of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases but children can still get measles and can still spread measles including to those too young to be immunized and those who cant be vaccinated because of medical reasons

6514363 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6514364 spending money on others makes you happier according to new research in the journal science the authors gave 46 volunteers a 5 or 20 bill and asked some to spend it on themselves and some to spend it on others by 5 pm at the days end the folks who felt happiest were the givers the researchers suspect that treating others gives us a sense that were strengthening our social ties and therefore buffering ourselves from bad experiences

6514370 the draft agreement with iraq would link troop reductions to achievement of certain security milestones although the details have not been made public the draft agreement with iraq would link troop reductions to achievement of certain security milestones i thought we didnt elect the flip flopper we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6514371 even for an organization like ours that sees the effects of torture on a daily basis the level of trauma experienced by iraqi refugees is startling
6514372 this kind of political violence destroys leaders as well as communities by spreading fear distrust and anger

6514374 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6514375 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6514376 we knew from x ray data that this black hole was actively swallowing up or accreting material if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds thus the high winds were our smoking gun showing that this black hole is small

6514385 here is a guy who never got caught up in partisan politics never viewed elected office as a career in itself and brought a sense of civility and thoughtfulness to every issued he addressed
6514386 would not only prepare future leaders but also one that would be a forum for active debate on the policy issues of the day and an academy that would produce the best research and nonpartisan advocacy based on that research
6514387 a lot of these young people stay somewhere in minnesota
6514388 thats a real tribute to the university that these graduates continue to contribute to our public life
6514389 it has inspired them to be community leaders in whatever setting they work to be more connected to community life and public policy
6514390 they accepted unusual characters like us who werent academics and they respected us
6514391 land grant universities are supposed to do three things teaching research and public service
6514392 they took that third thing the public service and did it well by linking the community and the university
6514393 when john was at the legislature i was covering economic issues often public policy and economics
6514394 he was just a wonderful and thoughtful teacher he really understood the important intersection between the media politics and academia
6514395 to use his academic knowledge and the bully pulpit he had as a politician to educate his peers educate the public and really raise the quality of the kind of reporting that was done
6514396 it is as focused as it has ever been maybe more focused on making sure that policy is informed by research and careful thought and that politics and good policy are pushing each other all of the time
6514397 in order to have these events covered you have to have enough reporters on staff and better yet reporters that have some depth and understanding of the policy issues under discussion
6514398 our newspapers in minnesota are not investing in their news departments to the extent that they once did it is more difficult to get a reporter in the door that it once was

6514433 in the bhagavad gita krishna identifies himself with everything in the universe bad and good
6514434 i form teh light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things
6514435 the god of our good is likewise the god of our evil
6514436 there is no malum in se self existent evil anything inherently evil of its own nature only the shadow of light without which light could have no existence even in our perceptions if evil disappeared good would disappear along with it from earth
6514437 what the heck am i working so hard for i dont get raises bonuses or promotions for all this extra work so why bother

6514447 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning
6514448 it is a sad day when we condone the abuse of one human being by another it is also a sad day when we condone such abuse by god
6514449 if god knew ahead of time that i will be heading to hell even before i was created why did god still created me anyway
6514450 god gave us free will in order to change our destiny
6514451 he knows the future but he doesnt know what we will do next
6514452 i believe that god knows where we are going based on our free will if we continue to do the things we are doing then he will continue to know where we are going
6514453 these reports show the most comprehensive picture of nhs dentistry to date under the new contractual arrangements

6514479 using treated sewage effluent to make artificial snow on the most sacred mountain of southwestern indian tribes does not violate the religious freedom restoration act rfra
6514480 under our prior case law a substantial burden on the exercise of religion exists where government action prevents an individual from engaging in religious conduct or having a religious experience and the interference is more than an inconvenience
6514481 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious belief and exercise as merely subjective is an excuse for refusing to accept the indians religion as worthy of protection under the rfra

6514531 ich bef rworte die eisb renhaltung in zoos nicht die zoos haben in der regel viel zu viele eisb ren so dass der zoonachwuchs kaum noch in anderen zoos untergebracht werden kann was das in der wirklichkeit bedeutet mag man sich gar nicht vorstellen
6514532 die eisb ren die in das neue hagenbeck gehege ziehen sollen tun mir jetzt schon leid eisb ren geh ren nicht in gefangenschaft
6514533 es gibt keine artgerechte gefangenschaftshaltung f r eisb ren das haben zahlreiche studien belegt
6514534 die zoohaltung von eisb ren dient vor allem der steigerung der einnahmen auf kosten der tiere
6514535 wie kommen sie auf die idee dass die artgerechte eisb renhaltung sehr schwierig sei hagenbeck h lt und z chtet seit hundert jahren sehr erfolgreich eisb ren
6514536 untersuchungen zeigen dass eisb ren von allen raubtieren in zoos die h chste jungensterblichkeit aufweisen
6514537 sp testens seit knut kann keine rede davon sein dass die eisb renhaltung nicht gew nscht ist dazu haben die medien beigetragen
6514538 eisb ren haben von allen raubtieren in zoos die h chste rate an verhaltensst rungen
6514539 tierfreunde sollten zoos mit eisb ren meiden sonst unterst tzen sie tierqu lerei
6514540 selbst kleine streifgebiete von eisb ren sind eine million mal gr er als ein zoogehege
6514541 die eingeschr nkte bewegungsm glichkeit ist f r die tiere katastrophal
6514542 die nat rlichen bed rfnisse von eisb ren k nnen im zoo nie erf llt werden

6514558 ein jahr wurde hier rumgebastelt bis der radweg endlich fertig war aber jetzt ist er bei regen so rutschig dass es gef hrlich wird besonders beim bremsen
6514559 hier wurde das falsche material verwendet deshalb die sperrung nun muss der weg wohl noch mal neu gemacht werden man h tte sich die ganze arbeit aber auch sparen k nnen dieses kleine st ck radweg braucht niemand man h tte es weglassen k nnen oder einfach zwei wei e streifen ziehen
6514560 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
6514561 als de gasbrander van een dakdekker die een huizenblok verder een dak aan het plakken was

6514563 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
6514564 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
6514565 as a physician i understand a basic virological fact that the public has not been told it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means the pandemic virus must already exist so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by sanofi pasteur reported to be a wholly owned subsidiary of total petroleum a french arm of the cartel supports our contention that the weaponized avian flu already exists as we saw in the case of the anthrax scare of 2001 an allegedly disgruntled government employee can release deadly toxins from even the most secure government facility
6514566 publicly available information shows the pharmaceutical industry and us government are both actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic this is shown through their own promotional literature and propaganda
6514567 the whole notion of an avian flu pandemic occurring without technological intervention is highly questionable to date there have only been around 385 human cases of avian flu identified worldwide assuming those identifications are trustworthy of course with 243 deaths to put the absurdity of this effort into perspective sudden cardiac death scd which many researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption is a leading cause of death according to the cdc for example scd killed 460 000 americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml mm5106a3 htm but aspartame a product of monsanto is an approved substance while the currently non pandemic avian flu is the focus of hugely expensive seemingly irrational preparations if there is no intent to create that very pandemic
6514568 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the

6514600 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6514601 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6514602 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6514603 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6514604 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6514605 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6514606 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6514607 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6514608 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6514609 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6514610 all campaigns have to have a clear strategy theme and message and this is a pretty strong one i think theyll keep hammering at it

6514621 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6514622 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6514623 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6514624 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
6514625 we thought wed stay away from beijing we honestly didnt come here to cause trouble
6514626 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way
6514627 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6514628 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6514629 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6514630 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida

6514648 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6514655 after centuries during which the jewish people were stateless after the holocaust there were obvious historical and religious reasons for establishing a jewish state
6514656 obviously we also hope that there will be a final settlement so that both the jews and the palestinian people will have a state
6514657 just like jews adventists dont work on the sabbath we also dont eat pork or shellfish
6514658 we do have something to learn from the jewish peoples challenges in reconciling religion with democracy
6514659 people are not sure what a future sikh state would look like and how religion would be a part of the governance of the state jews have already had experience with these issues
6514660 sikhs can definitely be considered a martial race although we make up about one percent of the population in india we constitute between 10 and 15 of the standing army during british rule the numbers were even higher at between 27 and 30
6514661 like the jewish people we have had to fight to defend ourselves against our hindu and muslim neighbors
6514662 besides the fact that my paternal grandmother was jewish i feel a special love and connection with the jewish people as a christian
6514663 i am neither pre millennial nor dispensationalist like some of my fellow evangelicals nevertheless i feel an intrinsic identification with the jewish people because of my commitment to biblical truth that people of other faiths might not have after all christianity is an outcome of judaism
6514664 at a personal level you cant love jesus and not love the jewish people otherwise it is a violation of your christianity all the christian bigotry and hatred directed against the jewish people throughout the ages is a sad aberration
6514665 we try to expose people on our missions to the big picture

6514687 marko hat das sehr gut gemacht er hat gezeigt was wir von ihm erwarten
6514688 a pesar de los esfuerzos de la conselleria de intentar convencernos de que es una medida favorable para todo el mundo
6514689 la excusa que puso la conselleria para que los establecimientos pudieran abrir fue que era muy conveniente que los parkings de las grandes superficies como aqua o el corte ingl s permanecieran abiertos para facilitar el aparcamiento a los asistentes al gran premio
6514690 lo que ocurre en esas grandes superficies es que para llegar hasta el parking hay que pasar obligatoriamente por las tiendas por lo que estos comercios quer an abrir
6514691 no se espera que el domingo sea un d a de gran afluencia y en el que se consigan grandes beneficios
6514692 lo que finalmente vaya a ocurrir es una inc gnita y
6514693 s se ha notado una mayor afluencia de gente durante esta ltima semana que se ha ido acrecentando conforme se ha llegado al jueves sobre todo en la zona del mar timo
6514694 los que m s se benefician son los bares restaurantes y hoteles
6514695 son d as en los que el n mero de turistas aumenta por la competici n y no est n todo el d a en el circuito
6514696 el domingo en cambio salvando tiendas de souvenirs o algunas muy espec ficas de algunos productos la gente ver la carrera y se ir no creemos que vayan a comprar aunque lo que finalmente ocurra es una inc gnita
6514697 la gente que viene a ver el gran premio no dedica mucho tiempo a las compras en tiendas alejadas de la zona del mar timo aunque s se llevan una buena imagen de la ciudad que les hace querer volver a visitarla y es en esa ocasi n de completo turismo cuando nuestros establecimientos perciben grandes beneficios
6514698 sin embargo declar si despu s de todo vemos que al final s que ha ido gente lo tomaremos como referencia para a os venideros y abriremos aunque creemos de verdad que eso no ocurrir

6514705 discussions are ongoing with the iraqis to finalize a bilateral agreement
6514706 we are working to complete the agreement but it is not final yet
6514707 we have to let go and were not reluctant to do that and the iraqis are not reluctant to take control
6514708 there is a measure of hope in iraq that was not present 18 months ago
6514709 now thats just a measure of hope its not a celebration
6514710 higher perceived risk the need to raise additional capital and hefty refunding needs in the near term have combined to push up the rate at which banks can borrow
6514711 the basic message was that people coming to this country should adapt
6514712 this wasnt a hateful e mail but one that touched upon a sentiment in this country and around the world that immigrants have to adapt to their new homes
6514713 clearly this is offensive behavior on behalf of a public official
6514714 thank you for standing up for our way of life
6514715 its about time someone had the you know what to speak up
6514716 if we were unhappy with his behavior before this is even worse
6514717 he cant keep hiding behind somebody elses name and passing out material that is hateful to support his perspective
6514718 its unfortunate that hes been so stubborn in not apologizing
6514719 battlelore is as perfect a fit for ffg as could possibly exist in the marketplace
6514720 needless to say were very excited and proud to include this power title and brand into ffgs family of products previous to today ffg had no fantasy battlefield game a void which we now can fill with this gorgeous industry leader we plan to support this game vigorously even in the very first discussion with eric and richard about this deal there was a flood of exciting ideas for how ffg can expand this game serve its community and move the brand of battlelore forward under the ffg banner
6514721 with its strong resources and superb track record in developing fantasy titles ffg is the perfect partner to take the battlelore game system to the next level in gaming as fans of the game ourselves we are confident it will be in great hands
6514722 this agreement now allows us to focus our resources on providing even more support for the other games in our portfolio as well as successfully launching yet to be announced new games
6514723 i am delighted with the opportunity to see battlelore gain a second life at fantasy flight and look forward to partnering with them as we continue to develop and expand the battlelore system
6514724 people are scared they need something that will last them help them through things they are scared of death so they want an afterlife people arent okay with the fact that this could all be just a fluke and there is no purpose they are fucking scared of that and so they have to have religion to explain it all

6514761 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6514762 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6514763 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6514764 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6514765 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6514766 they are more of a reference to an archetype than a character the female lieutenant to a james bond villian as i see it
6514767 respecter le droit fondamental et universellement reconnu exprimer pacifiquement ses opinions
6514768 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6514769 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6514770 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6514771 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6514772 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6514773 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6514774 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6514775 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6514776 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6514777 dwayne andreas just owns me but i mean that in a nice way
6514778 when a cause comes along and you know in your bones that it is
6514779 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6514780 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6514781 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6514782 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6514783 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6514784 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6514785 aku la jingok mereka bekumpul rame rame didepan gerbang sekolah tapi waktu aku nak belari lagi kedalam hengki narik tangan aku kuat nian untuk dibawak keluar aku berontak sekuat tenago dan akhirnyo setelah aku tinju dio aku berhasil lepas
6514786 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6514787 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6514788 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6514789 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6514790 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6514791 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6514792 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6514793 who are open to doing something on the production side
6514794 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6514795 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6514796 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6514797 the problem of unsightly text is often caused by a designers failure to use neutralizing techniques
6514798 were talking about 45 000 season ticket holders who chose not to come to the game they chose to say well stay home rather than experience one of the great moments in the recent history of our franchise sorry ive got a problem with that i take nothing back
6514799 he loves the game hes a great ambassador for the sport
6514800 why she was one of the sweetest whores i ever tasted
6514801 terrell do you feel like youre misunderstood omigod i felt the same way
6514802 jeff never got a fair shake coaches didnt know how to utilize him you cant handle my truth
6514803 you fackin pricks dont appreciate larry fackin bird or ah melrose place like i fackin do
6514804 look guys gilbert just wrote about buying a new fendi knapsack hes so cool
6514805 look at that guy hes got mud on him i like that thats big nate newton for ya
6514806 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6514807 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6514808 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6514809 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6514810 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6514811 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6514812 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6514813 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6514814 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6514815 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6514816 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6514817 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6514818 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6514819 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6514820 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6514821 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6514822 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6514823 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6514824 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6514825 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6514826 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6514827 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6514828 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6514829 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6514830 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6514831 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6514832 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6514833 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6514834 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6514835 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6514836 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6514837 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6514838 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6514839 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6514840 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6514841 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6514842 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6514843 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6514844 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
6514845 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6514846 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6514847 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6514848 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6514849 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6514850 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6514851 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6514852 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6514853 in making its decision microsoft recognized what we in iowa have known all along our workforce and quality of life is top notch
6514854 he has lots of experience at the top level and his international record is phenomenal
6514855 the signing of djibril shows how far this club have moved on since the end of last season
6514856 his experience will bring a lot to the squad and he will hopefully add some goals to the side
6514857 he is known for scoring them as well as creating them
6514858 im really pleased to join a good club with good players
6514859 sunderland are a club i think is going to achieve things they have big ambitions that is why i chose to come here
6514860 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6514861 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6514862 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6514863 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6514870 the team is definitely on a high right now believing we were going to make a statement in the whole tournament
6514871 it didnt start like we wanted to but we just kept digging and getting better each game it was a full team effort and it was so special with everyone doing it together
6514872 when i was 6 years old i thought i was the only girl in the whole world who played soccer i wasnt allowed to play because i was a girl
6514873 back then i could never imagine to be a professional player or a professional coach now im sitting with a great player christie rampone and looking at her gold medal i am so proud
6514874 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6514875 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6514876 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6514877 in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6514878 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong
6514879 i never think that people die they just go to department stores

6514910 to provide an environment where all the elements of the hiv aids community can express themselves legally and participate completely in the conference
6514911 is considered a crime in mexico and activists and their organizations can be subject to the resulting application of criminal and civil law
6514912 historically mexican law and security agents have anticipated and planned to prevent protests crimes and the exhibitions of social disobedience in all events where people congregate
6514913 aids security plan 2008 version 11 july 2008 is inspired in the bush anti terrorist doctrine and cannot be any different aids has been considered a matter of national security in mexico and the world because of the killing of people who live with hiv aids sponsored by corrupt governments and voracious pharmaceuticals that give greater privilege to their corporate profits than to the life of millions of people living with hiv aids

6514915 we are pleased with the overwhelmingly positive responses we have had from our prolight invitation among our existing v dosc and kudo users
6514916 the interest and feedback we are currently getting on the k1 kudo la8 system approach and the redeployment of the dosc network concept is very encouraging the new dosc network chart covers important concepts of minimum inventories rental market segmentation the adoption of a unified world standard with the new amplified controllers and a strong emphasis on user education our clients demand these quality standards and a formal rental network structure

6514918 the lifesaving impact america is having in the poorest parts of the world thanks to support from everyday americans and political leaders from across the spectrum the group says
6514919 millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries and
6514920 from iowa all the way through south dakota and montana barack and i have met so many members of the one campaign who are dedicated to ensuring this country plays a leadership role in fighting global poverty and disease
6514921 barack believes that we all have both a security stake and a moral obligation to help those across the world most in need its not only the right thing to do but its the smart thing to do in building a stronger safer and more just world for our children and our childrens children
6514922 i recently traveled to rwanda with the one campaign for the first time since my visit there in 1994 at the height of the rwandan genocide cindy mccain is quoted as saying
6514923 i was pleased to see how simple affordable u s investments are saving lives helping transform communities and building goodwill toward america i am proud of the one campaign for spreading this message and raising the profile of these vital issues in this election
6514924 i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
6514925 perhaps companies will want to put wind farms atop our bridges and skyscrapers
6514926 im very encouraged i think this is the first time weve seen such progress where the province has created an organization to pull together a lot of transit partners
6514927 the gtha is a collection of many cities and people have to move through the whole area we need a coordinated approach
6514928 i think its off to the right start but the really important vision is coming forward this fall the next thing metrolinx has to deal with is coming up with an investment strategy
6514929 tackling gridlock is one of the most important things we can do to build a strong and prosperous economy and building a modern rapid transit system that moves people and goods quickly and efficiently will ensure we can attract and keeps thousands of good high paying jobs
6514930 we want this study to set the vision and focus on the development and future transit needs of this vital corridor both mississaugas and bramptons transportation plans have recognized the potential significance of this high order transit corridor for many years
6514931 i think theres lots more that can be done i think it was really a great first step we got the engine started
6514932 really what need to happen is to work closely with business associations to try and get businesses involved
6514933 to really encourage businesses to get involved with the program and car pooling
6514934 were looking at how we could encourage employers to help employees purchase transit passes
6514935 and were sitting down to see if we can get into some partnerships with businesses and also with mississauga transit
6514936 distinguishing special events from traditional aes convention activities is like splitting hairs

6514944 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6514945 with more attention than ever before being focused on understanding our planets climate weather systems and atmosphere its important that scientists challenge their own assumptions and current theories of how these complex processes work i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes
6514946 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture
6514947 a better understanding of the sensory world of the child and the scientific basis for distaste and how to ameliorate it is a public health priority
6514948 the number one reason for non compliance among children when taking medicine or eating vegetables is that they dont like the taste
6514949 just look at a childs face when theyre eating some of these things
6514950 bitter taste is a sensation that evolved to make you not want to ingest something
6514951 it is interesting because it may suggest that children have heightened bitter sensitivity compared to adults
6514952 we find that the more a mother eats fruits when shes pregnant the more a child will accept fruits and vegetables
6514953 in england there is a lot of lemon flavor added to childrens medicine its a cultural phenomenon bubblegum and cherry are popular in the united states
6514954 it is one of the fundamental mysteries of human behavior why do we grow to like these foods and flavors that we initially rejected
6514955 automatic mental associations predict future choices of undecided decision makers
6514956 this kind of testing has many applications but certainly political polling at election time would be one it cant give answers to all questions but it could certainly help pollsters to get more information than people now share
6514957 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6514958 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6514959 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6514960 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6514961 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6514962 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6514963 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine

6514967 were in the business of growing the linux platform and making sure the development process of linux is maintained in a way that is productive and safe
6514968 one of the things that make linux work as a development project is the fact that linus torvalds who is the final decision maker on the release of the kernel works at a place that is not one of the competitors that collaborates on the project
6514969 the foundation is a perfect place for people to come together on projects that are difficult long require coordination and arent necessarily strategic from a competitive point of view so vendors want to share the cost
6514970 everyone just has a different approach and they cant agree on just one its really just an issue of discipline within the industry and the community
6514971 im not the cop here on this stuff and i would rather see community members coming to a rough consensus rather than us saying what to do
6514972 weve expanded the board to be more participatory and opened up seats for community members
6514973 we have more board level representation from smaller organizations and the ability to be on our board is much more affordable than it was under the osdl
6514974 my goal in the organization is to diversify our revenues so we have a broad base of representation
6514975 so no single entity dominates the organization and i think weve achieved that
6514976 they serve a great purpose in bringing together the community commercial linux companies and end users and they represent the interests of each group very well we have a very close relationship with jim and were very pleased with the direction hes taken the linux foundation
6514977 they the linux foundation try to stay neutral and not assume they are the ones owning development
6514978 in general they have done a good job at trying to get companies to provide specifications and legal assistance to developers in general from what we can see the development community is neutral to positive about the linux foundation
6514979 given the peso amounts required to complete the capital expenditures approved for the second regulatory period it is not possible or practical to finance all of these solely through meralcos internally generated funds or collections

6515062 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6515063 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway

6515070 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6515071 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6515072 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6515073 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6515074 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6515075 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6515076 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6515077 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

6515081 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6515082 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6515083 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6515084 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6515085 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6515086 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6515087 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6515088 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6515089 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6515090 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6515091 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6515092 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

6515097 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6515098 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6515099 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6515100 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6515101 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6515102 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have different perspective
6515103 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6515104 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6515105 it is a basic nt understanding that the risen jesus is not restored to the normal life that he possessed before death he possesses eternal life and is in gods presence
6515106 blessed are you who have not seen and yet believe

6515112 we have seen an increasing number of complex cases where certain applications and certain content may be appropriate or available to specific audiences and users but not to others

6515114 robbery protection rackets prostitution gambling drug sales and associated arms dealing and violence are thriving
6515115 the pacific is developing its comparative advantage as a location for international criminal activities such as people smuggling drug production and arms trafficking
6515116 the pacific is sharply divided between islands that are functionally literate and those that remain basically illiterate
6515117 we will be long term partners with the region on the condition that our investment in these areas is met through these development partnerships and resulting in measurable achievements there is no blank cheque here
6515118 these schemes will no doubt benefit the individuals lucky enough to be selected to participate but even the high guest worker numbers would not help the employment problems of png fiji and the solomon islands
6515119 the pacific can only avoid looming economic social and political crises if its large economies dramatically reform their policies to encourage substantial employment creating growth

6515123 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers
6515124 the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6515125 e davvero sorprendente abbiamo carattere e gusti completamente diversi eppure forse lespressione spiriti affini significa proprio questo
6515126 i sentimenti che esplosero quella notte li ricordo intensi e luminosi come il
6515127 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del proprio destino
6515128 il mio sogno era di portare la band al successo e fare in modo che tutti i giapponesi conoscessero il mio nome anche se poi nessuno di loro si sarebbe mai preso la briga di chiamarmi per dialogare con me
6515129 sai hachi si dice che per capire davvero limportanza di una persona bosogna prima perderla io credo invece che limportanza di una persona si comprenda davvero quando la si rivede a distanza di tempo non sei daccordo anche tu se adesso rivedessi te e gli altri sicuramente mi viziereste e mi coccolereste come una volta questa prospettiva mi spaventa a tal punto che non riesco a muovermi da qui
6515130 probabilmente uno come takumi ti far piangere e disperare pi di una volta ma la colpa tua perch ti sei innamorata di un cretino simile ti sei gi abituata allidea che ogni tanto ti metter le corna vero quando succeder prendilo a pugni finch non ti sarai sfogata
6515131 nana per coltivare ci che si ama necessaria la pazienza ma allora perch dio ha creato gli essere umani in modo tale che la pazienza tanto pi scarsa quanto pi grande lamore che provano
6515132 il futuro che costruir con takumi una strada che ho scelto personalmente dopo molti dubbi quindi non voglio dovermi pentire della mia decisione eppure solo ora mi rendo conto di quanto sia alto il prezzo che dovr pagare
6515133 ogni volta che il cuore freme per il desiderio di felicit si finisce sempre per
6515134 sai nana in mezzo a qualunque folla io mi trovi in qualunque forma tu appaia sono certa che sapr sempre ritrovarti perci per quanto tristi siano le mie giornate non ti verr mai incontro a capo chino perch la meta che vado inseguendo si trova nelle tue mani
6515135 se fosse possibile azzerare questa vita piena di errori e ripartire da capo a cominciare da quale momento corregeresti i tuoi sbagli io comincerei dalla notte di neve in cui ci siamo conosciute sei lunica cosa del mio passato che non voglio cancellare
6515136 a quellepoca cercavo disperata un legame inscindibile che mi unisse profondamente inestricabilmente a unaltra persona ma i legami tra gli esseri umani non si possono stringere come nastri si pu solo camminare mano nella mano non farti serrare in un nodo soffocante
6515137 sai nana i sentimenti delle persone mutano con facilit e la realt che si riflette nel loro sguardo illusione non ci sono certezze per anche quando la luna ci appare calante in realt la sua forma resta sempre immutata non dimenticarlo mai
6515138 anche se in questo momento ti trovi lontano sei sempre dentro di me ricordo il tuo sguardo forte e sincero e ascolto sempre le tue canzoni che sono la mia fonte di incoraggiamento e tu nana la senti la mia voce
6515139 sai nana se quel giorno non seppi comprendere la tua tristezza non dipese certo dai tuoi occhiali scuri che non lasciavano trapelare i tuoi sentimenti era lassurda idealizzazione che ti avevo costruito intorno ad ofuscarmi la vista
6515140 per quanto io canti e canti e canti lunica cosa che ottengo che
6515141 non poter realizzare i suoi desideri non poter vedere i miei realizzati da lui che gusto c a stare assieme cos
6515142 il fatto che perdere ci che ho mi spaventi una prova di quanto sia
6515143 il fatto che mia madre dopo avermi abbandonata fosse sopravvissuta senza
6515144 mia madre mi ha abbandonata quando avevo quattro anni e ha quindici ho perso
6515145 ho imparato che non ha importanza quanto e come si ama tutti noi uomini e donne viviamo le nostre vite da soli non ha senso volersi appropriare di qualcuno e nonostante lo sappia a volte me ne dimentico ancora purtroppo non posso fare a meno di pensarci e mi sento cos sola e triste
6515146 il dolore mi stringeva cos forte il petto da togliermi il respiro
6515147 a quellepoca non ero in grado di amare nessuno in modo maturo ed equilibrato
6515148 sai nana veder realizzati i propri sogni ed essere felici sono due cose completamente diverse questa contraddizione mi ancora incomprensibile
6515149 il vero amore significa non pretendere niente e proteggere da lontano la donna amata ne sono sicuro e cos per una volta che ti innamori desideri avere tutto da una persona questa la natura umana
6515150 shin uomini e donne sono schiavi del desiderio sessuale giusto tu pensi che tra loro possa esistere davvero lamore
6515151 andare allattacco sapendo che sar abbattuto di sicuro mi sento come un kamikaze dannazione vorrei vincere contro quel bastardo almeno in qualcosa in cosa posso vincere contro quello l
6515152 ti giuro che se vorrai diventare la mia donna io far limpossibile per renderti
6515153 manda pure in frantumi le mie illusioni non ho paura tanto non saprei come fare a cancellare la tua immagine dal mio cuore
6515154 ero molto pi fragile di quanto credevo pensavo che un uomo dovesse difendere la sua donna con le ragazze con cui uscivo mi comportavo da spaccone solo ora ho capito che mi sbagliavo nel momento stesso in cui mi sono innamorato di te ho realizzato che la mia virilit e equiparabile a quella di un castoro ma finch tu sarai al mio fianco posso fare limpossibile
6515155 ho capito che sono veramente felice solo quando posso suonare la chitarra
6515156 forse stai idealizzando troppo la creatura chiamata donna non penserai che
6515157 lei diversa da tutte le ragazze che conosco loro vogliono avere il mio corpo o addirittura il mio cuore invece lei gentile con me e non pretende niente in cambio questo fa percepire il vero affetto
6515158 non preoccuparti lho fatto per avere la risposta alla domanda del secolo uomini e donne sono schiavi del desiderio sessuale non vero pensi che tra loro possa esistere lamore lamore quello che lega voi due giusto avete anche fatto sesso ma perch voi due siete innamorati quindi lamore pu esistere per qualcuno
6515159 chi ti dice che non possa esistere anche per te
6515160 una persona che piange in questo modo ha un cuore profondo e sensibile non pu scrivere cose superficiali ci sono molte ragazze tra le fan dei trapnest e questo perch condividono le emozioni delle frasi che scrivi nei testi
6515161 lo credo bene la mia specialit non sei la sola a pensarlo sai
6515162 i trapnest mi portano via sempre tutto la donna con cui stavo si trasferita
6515163 signor okazaki ha tirato su questo figlio per quindici anni eppure non era sangue del suo sangue mi chiedo come sia possibile che non le importi niente di lui
6515164 sfortunatamente non ho mai provato affetto per shinichi neanche una volta ho provato con tutto il mio cuore ma non ce lho fatta
6515165 pare che sia andata un attimo in alaska a compare un pacchetto di sigarette
6515166 gli esseri umani in fondo sono tutti soli e per quanto si avvicinino l uno all altra non potranno mai diventare una cosa unica so benissimo che irragionevole per a volte non posso fare a meno di pensare che sarebbe bello se nana fosse solamente mia cos almeno potrei infilarla nella tasca del chiodo e portarla fino a tokyo con me
6515167 no non credo che ci entrerebbe forse sarebbe pi efficace provare a dirle senti tu vieni con me
6515168 ti sei sempre presa troppo sul serio passavi le giornate a rimuginare eri triste a quanto pare anche hachiko ti vuole molto bene dovresti esserne felice trovo che i sentimenti che provi per lei siano davvero deliziosi la vostra proprio una bella amicizia
6515169 la gente che mi sta intorno mi stressa di continuo dicendo non fare questo non fare quello che ti rovini limmagine ma io sono io non posso smettere si essere me stessa perch me lo ordinano
6515170 dici davvero shin non lo sai il filo rosso quello a cui sono legate mignolo a mignolo le persone compagne nel destino io per non credo affatto a questo tipo di fatalismo sai come la penso che lunica cosa che pu legare due persone unite nel destino la fiducia reciproca
6515171 scusa tanto nana adesso non venirmi a dire che non hai mai sentito parlare dellistinto maschile gli uomini fanno sesso quando ne hanno voglia a prescindere dai sentimenti
6515172 non la gentilezza nei suoi confronti che ti spinge a chiederle scusa ma il semplice fatto che vuoi toglierti un peso dalla coscienza
6515173 kyosuke ti faccio notare che gli hai fatto la ramanzina
6515174 forse mi sono fatto prendere un po la mano ma meglio cos il mio motto
6515175 kyosuke e jun a voi sembra normale dire cose simili
6515176 ecco perch non vai bene per nana sei un ghiacciolo
6515177 e tu un ice berg non hai saputo scaldarle il cuore non vai bene
6515178 e poi ti nascondi sempre dietro la tua timidezza avevamo assodato da tempo che il tipo ideale per nana deve essere un personaggio particolare cio uno che sa essere un buon amico e che sa quando dire la cosa giusta a quanto pare non basta solo laffetto
6515179 ricordati che shoji egoista secondo me non sente per nulla la mancanza di nana
6515180 guarda che shoji sempre stato innamorato di nana il punto che amava di pi sachiko
6515181 forse perch sachiko amava di pi shoji pi di quanto non facesse nana
6515182 tu credi non era nana che aveva detto che non poteva pi vivere senza shoji
6515183 si ma noi non possiamo fare scale di valori ipotizzando chi amasse di pi chi forse il problema sta nellesprimere i propri sentimenti nana passa da un estremo ad un altro difficile starle dietro
6515184 per quel che ho capito questo takumi un personaggio forte stando a quando ci ha raccontato nana una persona con una risolutezza inusuale devo ammettere che lo ammiro
6515185 ah davvero io invece ritengo che sia solo una persona egocentrica e aridista
6515186 ha usato il cellulare di nana per fare quel discorso intimidatorio al povero nobu che ovviamente rimasto pietrificato dal suo atteggiamento aggressivo e stato scorretto voleva intimorire nobu per toglierselo di torno e per essere sicuro di non aver ostacoli ha tenuto nana chiusa a chiave se le volesse veramente bene non si comporterebbe mai cos e il tipo di persona che tende delle trappole al prossimo per raggiungere il proprio obbiettivi
6515187 comunque se stato in grado di calcolare tutto questo in cos poco tempo una
6515188 mi stai dicendo che hai paura di junko bh per in effetti junko fa davvero paura era una teppista
6515189 ancora oggi non riesco a dimenticare ci che accadde quella sera nana cant la canzone di nobu ancora priva di testo aggiungendovi delle parole in un inglese senza senso e io divenni prigioniera di quella voce come se un misterioso incantesimo mi stesse avvolgendo nella sua spirale il tavolo come palcoscenico il cellulare come microfono e la luna crescente come riflettore lunica persona in grado di praticare questo tipo di incantesimo nana di questo sono convinta ancora oggi
6515190 oggi vedr nobu come devo comportarmi chiss forse lui non mi sorrider mai

6515242 an act to incorporate the subscribers to the bank of the united states
6515243 that the notes or bills of the said corporation although the same be on the faces thereof respectively made payable at one place only shall nevertheless be received by the said corporation at the bank or at any of the offices of discount and deposit thereof if tendered in liquidation or payment of any balance or balances due to said corporation or to such office of discount and deposit from any other incorporated bank
6515244 the cashier of the bank shall annually report to the secretary of the treasury the names of all stockholders who are not resident citizens of the united states and on the application of the treasurer of any state shall make out and transmit to such treasurer a list of stockholders residing in or citizens of such state with the amount of stock owned by each
6515245 to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying those powers into execution
6515246 the act to incorporate the bank of the united states is a law made in pursuance of the constitution
6515247 where the law is not prohibited and is really calculated to effect any of the objects intrusted to the government to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its necessity would be to pass the line which circumscribes the judicial department and to tread on legislative ground
6515248 that no other bank shall be established by any future law of the united states during the continuance of the corporation hereby created for which the faith of the united states is hereby pledged provided congress may renew existing charters for banks within the district of columbia not increasing the capital thereof and may also establish any other bank or banks in said district with capitals not exceeding in the whole 6 000 000 if they shall deem it expedient
6515249 the congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever
6515250 congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries

6515255 in consideration of the exclusive benefits and privileges continued by this act to the said corporation for fifteen years as aforesaid
6515256 is not prohibited and is really calculated to effect any of the objects intrusted to the government
6515257 but how stood the case in 1816 when he was called upon to examine the powers of the general government to incorporate a national bank a total change of circumstances was presented events of the utmost magnitude had intervened
6515258 a general suspension of specie payments had taken place and this had led to a train of circumstances of the most alarming nature
6515259 waiving the question of the constitutional authority of the legislature to establish an incorporated bank as being precluded in my judgment by repeated recognitions under varied circumstances of the validity of such an institution in acts of the legislative executive and judicial branches of the government accompanied by indications in different modes of a concurrence of the general will of the nation

6515316 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6515317 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6515318 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6515319 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6515320 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6515321 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6515322 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6515323 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6515324 our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6515325 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6515326 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6515327 he would hold a match in one hand and a hose in the other he could flip back and forth with effectiveness
6515328 his passion for his players was real his passion to lead was real
6515329 counting the afl championship in 1967 and victories in super bowls xi and xv upshaw became the only player ever to start on championship teams in both the afl and nfl
6515330 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6515331 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6515332 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6515333 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6515334 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6515335 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6515336 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6515337 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success

6515357 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6515358 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6515359 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6515360 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6515361 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about
6515362 theres plenty of agenda items but theres not much substance in them

6515404 the use of united states armed forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the united states
6515405 we will not cut off funding for the troops absolutely not let me remove all doubt in anyones mind as long as our troops are in harms way democrats will be there to support them
6515406 this is absolute nonsense in truth the history of the conflict is not over occupation and never has been it is over the fundamental right of israel to exist
6515407 israels qualitative military edge will be empirically assessed on an ongoing basis
6515408 ensuring the security of israel and the entire world demands that we do more to convince iran to give up its nuclear ambitions and cease its support for terrorist groups

6515410 i took impeachment off the table a long time ago you cant talk about impeachment unless you have the facts and you cant have the facts unless you have cooperation from the administration i think the republicans would like nothing better than for us to focus on impeachment and take our eye off the ball of a progressive economic agenda

6515421 i want my hair this style this cut by this time
6515422 he took this decision not because it was the graceful and generous thing to do but because political necessity dictated it after he lost the support of america and the army
6515423 was he a hawk disguised in a liberal cloak or a moderate and progressive man whose military training had in the past turned him into a trigger happy leader was he really sincere about the progress of this country or were his policies only targeted at perpetuating his rule
6515424 fundamentalist military elements always strong in the isi together with fundamentalist opposition members of parliament forced the prime minister and the rest of the civilian political establishment to make the move
6515425 the culture here in la has always revolved around the car and the city has always been spread out now at least a group of like minded people and brands have set up shop close together you can argue that theres too much of a good thing here on fairfax but as time goes on and restaurants and stores that dont specifically cater to streetwear open here itll round out the block and bring it all together
6515426 there was nowhere to go out here it was a void i would have to fly home to the east coast for gear
6515427 i knew them from the sneaker spot i was working at
6515428 but one day they come in and theyre asking about the light fixtures instead of the new arrivals that gave it away i thought they wanted me to consult or get some contacts but really they were recruiting me
6515429 we do well because our clientele run in those circles
6515430 so we have a network and resources where marketing is concerned it opens doors to select the brands we want to work with
6515431 any boutique you walk into out here if they are doing it right you will get a sense of their culture its all about looking fresh always about style having swagger it benefits vegas overall we wanted to bring a piece of us to it bring that new york culture i mean knyew stands for keeping new york every where

6515434 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6515435 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6515436 i couldnt drive the car anywhere every neighborhood was flooded
6515437 ive been kind of going crazy in the house for all of this time but at least the cable didnt go out
6515438 the russians have proved that their only aim is really the improvement of the lot of the russian people
6515439 any government is evil if it carries within it the tendency to deteriorate into tyranny the danger is more acute in a country in which the government has authority not only over the armed forces but also over every channel of education and information as well as over the existence of every single citizen
6515440 as they say the incident is closed the love boat wrecked by daily life im all even with life and nothing would be gained by listing mutual hurts troubles and insults this is not the way i recommend but there is no other way out dont think im a coward seriously it could not be helped lili love me

6515445 we are delighted to congratulate the reach scholars who earned high marks on rigorous college level exams
6515446 i would have thought for kids who were on the borderline that they would have seen an improvement
6515447 it helped motivate students to study more and try harder
6515448 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6515449 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years

6515478 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6515479 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6515480 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6515481 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6515482 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6515483 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6515484 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6515485 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6515486 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6515487 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6515488 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6515489 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
6515490 we thought wed stay away from beijing we honestly didnt come here to cause trouble
6515491 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way

6515494 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal

6515496 the more minutes together the better we played and ive been working for nine months now with this team and it was about finding the rhythm and in the way we believed in attack
6515497 it is a hard moment i dont know what to say
6515498 it was not a lack of opportunities but rather it was a lack of patience on the one shot the usa had they scored and whoever scores the goal wins we lost focus after the americans scored

6515556 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6515557 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6515558 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6515559 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it

6515577 there can be no fellowship with rome for once the protestant church is entangled in the web there is no escape for sudden destruction will come upon it jesus came to give life but antichrist rome administers the kiss of death there must be no compromise with rome and no appearance of compromise
6515578 when we remember the origins of this church from as far back as the tower of babel in babylon and the countless idolatrous and blasphemous satellite churches of rome and those millions of protestants that have been tortured and slaughtered by this same church is there need to say more
6515579 however in defiance of historical fact protestants continue to succumb to the lure of rome
6515580 an up to date example of the attraction of evil is the fascination of our leaders with europe and their willingness to sacrifice the independence and self sufficiency of our great nation as they lust for power in the forthcoming superstate of europe
6515581 today we are experiencing a similar betrayal by the leaders of our protestant churches

6515596 well today it is safer than it was yesterday because there are three less guns on the street and there are three less gun dealers on our streets of staten island
6515597 today we will be exploring the intriguing effects of statistical regression on the intercostile rib region im sure youve all read the long articles i sent you an hour before class
6515598 we dont believe at this time that any of the machines were owned by local businesses we do believe that they were placed there through outside sources that own the machines we think the profits were split between owner and business
6515599 the title of the show is humans nature and the work in the show is about humans own naturalism and the way we need to take ownership of it
6515600 for a long time i think humans have separated themselves from nature but everything we do say eat build is all natural thats the basic premise
6515601 at the time in 2006 i really started to get into artists whose work was raw and edgy and lacked perfection
6515602 stuff that was more expressive and outsider underground than perfectly rendered or executed figurative work
6515603 i like to tell people the work comes out of a personal re education
6515604 agriculturally im trying to learn how to feed myself and become less reliant on stores less reliant on outside resources major corporations that sort of thing
6515605 instead of banging my head against the wall i try and change my personal reality
6515606 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6515607 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6515608 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6515609 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6515610 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6515611 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6515612 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6515613 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6515614 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6515615 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to
6515616 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6515617 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6515618 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6515619 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6515620 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6515621 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6515622 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6515623 poor uneducated oppressed muslim lashing out in frustration at his oppressor
6515624 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved

6515632 the insinuation that john mccain a former prisoner of war is rich is outrageous

6515828 these people were my friends and co workers and we were sort of united in this quest for cool stuff
6515829 the marketing department had never played a video game marketing thought the programmers were lazy the programmers thought marketing was stupid we didnt like them they didnt like us

6515838 at least a half dozen tenants told the daily journal that they live in mold infested bug infested apartments with routine maintenance problems that are either ignored entirely or patched up inefficiently
6515839 the owner of evergreen square ronald von kurnatowski jr of new orleans based fountainbleau management services denied those allegations he said the situation there has been exaggerated by a handful of unruly tenants bent on attacking the current manager they dislike her he said because she enforces the rules
6515840 von kurnatowski also said he is unaware of any mold and claims the on site maintenance crew fixes all problems efficiently and thoroughly

6515849 i love the science idol calendar and thought this would be a great way to use my cartooning for a good cause
6515850 is that it seeks to make a laughing matter out of something which is really no laughing matter
6515851 after all once you lose your sense of humor there isnt much left
6515852 it has created opportunities that i only thought i could dream of
6515853 they are both inventors who use creativity and fresh ideas to fuel their work if you were to alter a scientists discoveries it would be the same as reworking an artists painting
6515854 it has become increasingly difficult to trust anything or anyone associated with power

6515859 science itself has no agenda truths about atoms chemistry and genetics exist regardless of which party is in the white house
6515860 when groups interfere with the scientific method they stain and ruin the findings no matter how benevolent or innocuous they believe their agenda to be
6515861 the nature of the topic and the political hypocrisy involved appeals directly to the essence of political cartooning which is to call attention to corruption hypocrisy and arrogance in government

6515864 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6515865 its the greatest feeling its my first olympics and my first olympic gold medal
6515866 the more minutes together the better we played and ive been working for nine months now with this team and it was about finding the rhythm and in the way we believed in attack
6515867 it is a hard moment i dont know what to say
6515868 it was not a lack of opportunities but rather it was a lack of patience on the one shot the usa had they scored and whoever scores the goal wins we lost focus after the americans scored
6515869 youll come out the other side eventually youll know more things youll be resilient and powerful in ways you hadnt foreseen just wait itll come

6515885 we are very very close to a sofa status of forces agreement but its not done
6515886 undoubtedly its true that the negotiators have taken this very very far towards an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement
6515887 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6515888 i am not going into the details now where we are on in specific issues except to say i think all issues have moved forward in a positive way
6515889 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable

6515897 re engagement with iraq means arabs have to settle their differences with iraq solving problems which threaten their existence and stability
6515898 the us has urged its allies to much more involved in iraq to counter the iranian influence there
6515899 americans will not leave iraq with a vacuum to be filled by people the us doesnt like
6515900 they americans will leave iraq at a certain time when iraq is in the arab circles
6515901 is it by isolating the governments supported by tehran or trying to get into it
6515902 irans increasing role is growing in the absence of an iraqi one
6515903 no country has a custody over iraq we want to have the best relations with iran the best relations with saudi arabia and the best relations with the us
6515904 it is who would call the shots in the regions security
6515905 the us has a border with almost every country in the region their troops are all over the place

6515922 the parade was fantastic we had lots of different costumes including a bunch of people dressed as athletes at the olympics
6515923 we had every sport going and it was a real spectacle
6515924 we were able to give out football strips to the local team so when they played they looked the part
6515925 the workington site of graham amp bowness opened in 1976 so its a great honour to have worked for the dealership from so early
6515926 over the years ive seen the business grow and also our customers many of whom have remained with the dealership almost as long as i have
6515927 being based at the workington site for so long has meant ross has become a trustworthy and familiar face to our customers in the workington area
6515928 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6515929 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6515930 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6515931 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6515932 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6515933 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6515934 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6515935 this is an exciting time for us and we are really looking forward to taking over
6515936 we will not be producing the kind of food you normally associate with hospitals
6515937 we will be doing the same pasties sausage rolls and sandwiches that we do in our shop
6515938 we will also be doing hot meals as we are aware that a lot of older people go to the hospital for their dinner and we want them to enjoy what they are eating
6515939 we will produce festive foods and do traditional tatie pots and hot soups
6515940 it will be a big test for us but we know we are more than capable of doing the job
6515941 over the last few years we have gone from strength to strength and we hope that will continue
6515942 we thought about it and we realised that we could do a good job and went for it
6515943 we were going to open the shop on oxford street anyway but when the fire burned out the old shop it hastened the move
6515944 we used to get a lot of entertainers wandering in when the rendezvous was open in what is now wetherspoon
6515945 jools holland who was performing at the carnegie theatre also came to have a look in the shop people were pointing at him and following him around

6515950 we are honored to be chosen by inc as the no 1 company in the top 50 media companies category and no 49 overall
6515951 our success and continued growth can be attributed to very strong consumer and advertiser interest in connecting with products seen on screen best of breed clients and an incredibly entrepreneurial staff we are thrilled to be recognized for our achievements
6515952 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6515953 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6515954 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6515955 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6515956 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6515957 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6515958 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6515959 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6515960 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6515961 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today

6515969 sierra is the largest circulation environmental magazine in the u s and they focused their formidable research capacity on evaluating campus sustainability
6515970 to stand out in that context especially alongside smaller highly respected campuses with the ability to tailor their sustainability programs more narrowly is an enormous tribute to the legacy of leadership cu students faculty and staff have shown for nearly 40 years

6516009 it is a hard moment i dont know what to say
6516010 it was not a lack of opportunities but rather it was a lack of patience on the one shot the usa had they scored and whoever scores the goal wins we lost focus after the americans scored
6516011 as far as we are concerned negotiations continue over the technical service contract
6516012 were thrilled that us cable is joining the long and growing list of distribution partners offering the big ten network to their customers

6516014 he is very talented thats why he is here he has performed well in the domestic circuit and has been a part of every india a tour this was his first game and he was under pressure especially playing against murali and mendis but i thought he negotiated them really well
6516015 he took up the challenge and responsibility to score those runs that was a good effort by the youngster and its good to have him in the side
6516016 he badrinath certainly had the pressure of scoring those runs that will give him more confidence and more experience you dont have to play 100 games to get experience the more you are in these situations the more comfortable you are in dealing with them in future a lapse of concentration against good bowlers will get you out
6516017 the credit should go to the fast bowlers especially bowling in tough hot and humid conditions zaheer particular bowled well he has been consistent for the last four years i have seen him bowl like this for sometime now he is always there he has moved way ahead even when it comes to his fielding even in england he bowled really well
6516018 whenever you give him the ball he will give more than 100 percent its really good to have a bowler like him

6516023 the conventions provide a big national spotlight for both candidates a chance to have the stage when voters are actually paying attention
6516024 it is an incredible opportunity to tell the american people your vision for the country and what you will do as president and that can change the dynamics of the race
6516025 they are finished with just telling voters about themselves now they have to show voters they are ready to be president
6516026 there is definitely going to be a contrast drawn between the two candidates
6516027 this convention will make the choice crystal clear between two very different approaches to leadership
6516028 the real open question is what is he going to do he has to take that question head on in this convention and make it clear in an unequivocal way what the two or three priorities for his candidacy are
6516029 i dont think americans have a clear sense of what his plan for the american economy is that is something they can fix at the convention and they need to do that
6516030 obama is cotton candy it tastes great but you cant live on it mccain is meat and potatoes

6516033 this song puts keith in the position of trying to eliminate love and memories to no avail it is with such songs that keith makes his sophomore album shine much brighter than his fast paced debut which also hit its high points in the few ballads keith offered up

6516219 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6516220 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6516221 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6516222 hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in current practice for fire resistance ratings
6516223 while the partial or total collapse of a tall building due to fires is a rare event we strongly urge building owners operators and designers to evaluate buildings to ensure the adequate fire performance of the structural system of particular concern are the effects of thermal expansion in buildings with one or more of the following features long span floor systems connections not designed for thermal effects asymmetric floor framing and or composite floor systems
6516224 we recommend that building standards and codes be strengthened beyond their current intent to achieve life safety by preventing structural collapse even during severe fires like this one when sprinklers do not function do not exist or are overwhelmed by fire
6516225 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6516226 what followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures failure first occurred all the way to the roof line involving all three interior columns on the most eastern side of the building then progressing from east to west across wtc 7 all of the columns in the core of the building failed finally the entire fa ade collapsed
6516227 sound level of 130 to 140 decibels at a distance of half a mile
6516228 while debris impact from the collapse of wtc 1 initiated fires in wtc 7 the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of wtc 7

6516269 rubens wie ist dein erster eindruck von der strecke hier in valencia
6516270 ich liebe sie anlage strecke fahrbahnbeschaffenheit asphalt alles fantastisch sie haben alles sehr gut vorbereitet das einzige was mir nicht gef llt ist der polizist der mir immer sagt dass ich rechts abbiegen muss mein hotel ist zu fu f nf minuten von hier entfernt aber ich brauche eine halbe stunde weil ich fast ber barcelona geschickt werde da sind sie nicht besonders gut vorbereitet aber sonst ist die situation von der strecke her wirklich gut
6516271 hoffst du dass du deine rundenzeit zwischen hotel und strecke noch reduzieren kannst
6516272 am sonntag m chte ich auf 20 minuten sein grinst anm d red
6516273 die strecke ist hnlich wie melbourne denn auf einem stadtkurs ist der platz immer begrenzt sie haben es nett gemacht wenn man in den kurven neun oder zehn im bereich der br cke ein problem hat dann muss man das rennen aber wahrscheinlich abbrechen denn da hilft nicht einmal das safety car man m sste das auto bergen und mit lkws auf die br cke fahren das k nnte ein kleines problem werden aber jetzt m ssen wir einmal abwarten wie schnell die autos hier sind die auslaufzonen sind in kurve eins am geringsten aber ansonsten ist alles okay
6516274 in budapest hattet ihr ein paar neue teile aber wie sieht es f r den rest der saison aus
6516275 was reine entwicklungsschritte angeht aerodynamisch oder mechanisch war es das wir m ssen aber das was wir in ungarn und davor eingef hrt haben noch optimieren wir haben kleine neuerungen in ungarn hatten wir eine neue hinterradaufh ngung aber leider konnten wir die aus zeitgr nden davor nicht am pr fstand testen da w re noch einiges mehr drin gewesen hier erwarten wir dass die aufh ngung besser funktionieren wird der spirit ist gut denn auch wenn nat rlich schon ans n chste jahr gedacht wird geben die leute auch f r das aktuelle auto noch alles ich freue mich schon auf das saisonfinale mit den bevorstehenden strecken hoffentlich k nnen wir noch punkten
6516276 es gibt ger chte dass fernando alonso zu honda kommen k nnte was bedeutet das f r dich
6516277 ich glaube das team redet definitiv mit fernando das ist das fragezeichen ich war noch nie so enthusiastisch ber die situation hier ich habe ferrari verlassen weil ich dort nicht alle freiheiten hatte die habe ich bei honda aber ich hatte noch kein gutes auto ich warte immer noch auf meine chance was soll ich sagen der tag an dem ich das gef hl habe dass ich langsamer bin als in meinem ersten rennen wird der tag sein an dem ich aufh re es finden gespr che statt und ich rede mit dem team ich rede mit allen teams ich will rennen fahren

6516280 o campeonato come ou com tudo errado mas acabou dando tudo certo
6516281 fizemos uma boa largada sa mos forte nosso in cio de prova foi muito bom mas depois tivemos um momento meio tenso quando estavam em quinto lugar j que a gente perdia a medalha de bronze mas recuperamos um pouco no final

6516284 aquela pequena cena que entrou no princ pio passou despercebida se n o puder n o vamos usar
6516285 essas coisas s o espont neas a gente tem que entender o cora o tem raz es que a pr pria raz o desconhece espero que o molon n o fique zangado comigo

6516292 zu allererst einmal ist es toll hier in valencia zu sein ich bin hier 2006 mit der gp2 gefahren aber jetzt bin ich zum ersten mal abgesehen vom mclaren mercedes launch vergangenes jahr in der stadt selbst es ist eine sehr sch ne stadt ich denke sie haben mit der strecke einen tollen job gemacht das hotel ist klasse und die strecke selbst sieht einfach unglaublich aus ich freue mich schon darauf morgen zu fahren
6516293 ich denke dass sie da einen guten job gemacht haben
6516294 ich denke dass wir alle richtig pushen es geht enger zu als im vergangenen jahr
6516295 du wurdest mit den worten zitiert dass f r den rest der saison die konstanz der schl ssel zum erfolg sei warum denkst du dass die titelkandidaten im vergleich zum vorjahr in diesem jahr weniger konstant sind
6516296 ich kann mich nicht daran erinnern das gesagt zu haben und ich kann da auch nur vermutungen anstellen ich denke dass wir alle richtig pushen es geht enger zu als im vergangenen jahr ich kann mir vorstellen dass alle teams noch mehr ans limit gehen und damit h ufen sich auch die fehler in diesem jahr haben wir viele m glichkeiten um fehler zu machen und wir treffen auf viele unbekannte wir haben neue strecken und an den autos ist vieles anders wenn ich mir meine ergebnisse aus der letzten saison anschaue dann hatten die ersten neun oder zw lf rennen wirklich etwas irreales an sich wer wei vielleicht geht das noch einmal ein jahr so aber ich denke dass wir in diesem jahr alle auf augenh he sind vor allem wir jungs an der spitze
6516297 in ungarn bist du mit dem superweichen reifen einen langen stint gefahren warst du zufrieden damit wie das funktioniert hat denn es gab ja probleme mit dem reifenabrieb habt ihr irgendetwas ver ndert
6516298 nicht wirklich ich denke dass die reifen recht hnlich waren ich musste zu diesem zeitpunkt reifen wechseln deshalb bin ich etwa 30 runden oder so mit dem weicheren reifen gefahren aber der reifen hat sehr gut gehalten und ich habe mich damit sogar wohler gef hlt als mit dem h rteren
6516299 kennt ihr denn schon die ursache f r den reifenschaden in ungarn nachdem bridgestone und eure ingenieure zeit hatten sich das noch einmal anzusehen es war zu h ren dass vielleicht der geriffelte randstein im scheitel mancher kurven die ursache sein k nnte es k nnten aber ebenso auch kleine wrackteile gewesen sein hast du dazu irgendwelche informationen
6516300 ich habe mit meinen ingenieuren noch nicht dar ber gesprochen das war beim letzten rennen sie k nnten die ingenieure fragen wenn sie mit denen eine pressekonferenz machen aber f r mich war es einfach ein reifenschaden es war eben etwas pech aber ich denke nicht dass sie die genaue ursache herausgefunden haben
6516301 k nnte dein fahrstil daf r sorgen dass du mit manchen reifenmischungen probleme hast
6516302 wegen der reifensch den in ungarn und in der t rkei vergangenes jahr
6516303 in der t rkei k nnte es mehr an meinen fahrstil gelegen haben aber ich denke nicht dass das in ungarn der fall war
6516304 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6516305 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6516306 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6516307 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6516308 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6516309 has a background and set of values that you can identify with
6516310 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
6516311 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the cloud to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
6516312 the heating is caused by the extreme compression of the cloud as it is squashed and pulled apart by the black hole this is balanced by the cooling which requires detailed knowledge of how quickly the radiation can escape the cloud
6516313 the work matches observations that the black hole at the heart of our own galaxy which is around four million times more massive than our sun is surrounded by two rings of young massive stars
6516314 a very minor process relative to star formation throughout the galaxy

6516341 windows xp users were generally happy with service pack 2
6516342 there was not a huge clamor for windows xp sp3 like there was for vista sp1 and that shows in the results its pretty clear that a lot of xp users are very content with sp2
6516343 they heavily promoted vista sp1 and went out of their way to put a good foot forward for it but they barely mentioned xp sp3

6516351 omg gross gross gross i cant say anything else but gross
6516352 i know your works that you are neither cold nor hot i could wish you were cold or hot so then because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will vomit you out of my mouth because you say i am rich have become wealthy and have need of nothing and do not know that you are wretched miserable poor blind and naked i counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire that you may be rich and white garments that you may be clothed that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed and anoint your eyes with eye salve that you may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten therefore be zealous and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in to him and dine with him and he with me
6516353 if you deny me before man i will deny you before my father and his angels

6516357 here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of god is my brother and my sister and mother
6516358 behold i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in to him and dine with him and he with me
6516359 i counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire that you may be rich and white garments that you may be clothed that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed and anoint your eyes with eye salve that you may see

6516361 meneer weet u precies waar de nederlanders opereren in afghanistan
6516362 ja die zitten in uruzgan daar hoor je toch al die nare berichten over
6516363 waarom vraagt u dat u draagt een marine uniform er zitten toch geen marinemensen in afghanistan
6516364 op dit moment zitten er ongeveer tachtig marinemensen in afghanistan de meesten van hen zijn vlootmedewerkers op individuele uitzending maar er zitten natuurlijk ook mariniers bij het operational mentor and liaison team en het marine joint effect observer groups in uruzgan
6516365 het grootste gedeelte van de marinemedewerkers is geplaatst in kandahar bij de staf van rc zuid op het vliegveld of bij het contingentscommando ook bij de overkoepelende isaf staf in kabul is marinepersoneel geplaatst en we mogen natuurlijk de mensen die het civiel militaire co rdinatiewerk doen in de prts niet vergeten zij helpen bij het daadwerkelijke opbouwen van het land
6516366 de wekker gaat elke ochtend om kwart over zes ik ga altijd ontbijten met mijn drie marinecollegas we gaan vaak naar de amerikaanse eetzaal niagara maar kiezen ook wel eens voor de franse of engelse kantine op mijn bureau heb ik een ongeclassificeerde computer en elke morgen voordat ik aan het werk ga check ik mijn priv mail s middags ga ik weer met mijn lunchen we kiezen dan altijd voor frans met lekker veel stokbrood en pasta de werkdag eindigt om vijf uur vaak ga ik daarna naar de personal exchange een grote amerikaanse tax free winkel om te kijken of ik nu echt alles in de winkel heb gekocht meestal is dat niet het geval we eten s avonds altijd met alle nederlanders die op het vliegveld werken en gaan daarna nog even een kopje koffie drinken de canadese koffieshop tim hortons heeft hier een vestiging en doet echt prima zaken de hele dag staan er mensen in de rij om een koffie chocolademelk frappucino of cappucino french vanilla te bestellen toch vreemd dat de canadezen zelf liever koffie drinken uit de senseoapparaten die veel nederlanders hebben laten opsturen vinden ze zulke lekkere zachte koffie
6516367 ik ga elke avond naar de sportzaal waar de amerikaanse soldaten pompend aan de apparaten hangen een keer heb ik gezien dat tijdens een wedstrijd armpje worstelen een van deze jongens zich niet helemaal bewust was van zijn eigen kracht en zo de bovenarm van zijn collega brak rare jongens die amerikanen na het sporten loop ik meestal een rondje over de boardwalk een vierkante overdekte houten wandelpromenade waaraan kleine winkeltjes tim hortons restaurants en fastfoodtenten zoals subways of burger king zitten er is zelfs een groot podium waar diverse internationale bands zangers en zangeressen zoals laatst lucie silvas al hebben opgetreden in het midden van de boardwalk is een hockeyarena gebouwd elke avond wordt er in teamverband hockey gespeeld in een competitie waar wel twintig teams aan mee doen er zijn ook twee beachvolleybalvelden en natuurlijk is er ook plaats voor voetbal honkbal en rugby ik sluit mijn rondje altijd af in de nederlandse hoek een soort van huiskamer waar in de late uurtjes van de dag nog even de wereldproblemen worden opgelost rond een uurtje of half twaalf ga ik naar mijn container om te slapen tot een paar weken geleden sliep ik in een tent dus dit is wel een verademing
6516368 de meeste mensen werken hier elke dag week in week uit ik dus ook maar heb dan wel verlichte werkzaamheden zaterdagochtend gaan we meestal naar de bazaar een afghaanse markt die hier op het kamp wordt gehouden zaterdagavond noem ik altijd de feestavond want dan ga ik met mijn landmachtcollega curry eten bij de engelse eetzaal en drinken we als dessert een cappucino french vanilla de avond sluiten we af met een biertje alcoholvrij weliswaar want drank is hier uit den boze elke zondag maak ik een wandeling van twaalf kilometer om het vliegveld heerlijk ontspannend om te doen en met ruim 300 vliegbewegingen per dag lijkt het wel of je op een vliegshow aanwezig bent de zondagmiddag besteden we aan schoonschippen en s avonds krijgen we altijd post uit nederland ik zit hier nu vier maanden maar ik ben nog lang niet uitgekeken in dit veertienvierkante kilometer grote kamp
6516369 met het team van de technische dienst verzorgden we de brandstof voor de generatoren maar tankten we ook de voertuigen af buitenlandse voertuigen kwamen dagelijks op het kamp om te tanken we kregen veelal buitenlandse militairen aan de pomp die vaak geen engels spraken met handen en voeten werden dan de benodigde papieren in orde gebracht omdat wij verantwoordelijk waren voor de installaties op het kamp kwamen we niet echt in aanraking met de afghanen wel waren er lokale werknemers werkzaam op het kamp er was een afwashulp en via een aannemer werkten er ook mensen aan de tuin of voerden kleine verbouwingen uit praten met deze mensen was moeilijk maar na enige tijd hadden we ze toch zo ver dat ze hazes liedjes konden meezingen
6516370 de werktijden van het prt zijn in principe gewoon dezelfde als die in nederland
6516371 het is buitengewoon interessant om in elkaars keuken te kijken meer dan twintig verschillende landen hebben hier hun militairen naartoe gestuurd dat is in mijn ogen uniek
6516372 woensdag hielden we weer een platformceremonie en wederom voor een omgekomen canadees een patrouille reed op een mijn en werd daarna beschoten een soldaat verloor beide benen en een kapitein werd door een kogel net onder zijn helm geraakt nummer 84 aan canadese zijde
6516373 een patrouille ontdekte een zelfmoordterrorist met een grijze tas de persoon hield initieel halt op een korte afstand van de patrouille en begon daarop richting de militairen te kruipen toen de patrouille hem probeerde te stoppen ontplofte hij er zijn verder geen gewonden gevallen
6516374 helaas is dit voor ons normaal geworden alsof je de weersverwachting zit te lezen
6516375 militairen dragen beschermende kleding maar de armen en benen zijn onbedekt
6516376 i thought i was leaving this reality i didnt want to go at first but later on in the night i just thought it was my time so i laid down and prepered for my change

6516466 true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6516467 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6516468 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6516555 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6516556 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6516557 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6516558 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6516568 the loss of a home community and security during a natural disaster such as katrina only magnifies the loss of a sense of place
6516569 reestablishing a sense of place and subsequently place attachment among both returning and new residents is paramount to the citys future success
6516570 in the aftermath of katrina most of the population that contributed to the citys world class culture remains in diaspora with former residents in nearly every state
6516571 the culture of new orleans is very much at risk when the people who make and preserve it are scattered and living in a sea of uncertainty and when the places where artists and traditional bearers live where they make and practice their art forms are largely destroyed
6516572 that is lacking in other places across the nation recognition that root culture matters
6516573 when you have no one there to make a place in this space whos going to make the gumbo you have to have a cultural sense of place
6516574 because culture will be an economic stimulus and possibly the most relied on sector in the region business and city planners will have to avoid the occurrence of disneyfication of the urban and social environments
6516575 exposed the social issues of segregation poverty and minority marginalization
6516576 the storm has virtually created a blank slate for the city almost as if the city was wiped from the earth and another city was built on its ruins
6516577 the society and culture of new orleans may never be the same again
6516578 as different people bring cultural and ethnic values of the city the cultural landscape will change to be more inclusive
6516579 the physical landscape is the foundation for other landscape development because it presents the natural characteristics that society employs

6516610 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever
6516611 the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb

6516722 hi marquis needless to say that i have followed your blog since a while now however i always avoided writing to you for advice as i understand how terribly busy you would be with handling your job and blog both but today i am standing at a crossroad wondering where to go i am in a desperate need of some advice and i do not know any other stanford alumni to whom i can turn to and so here i am wanting some of your precious time i am an indian female 31 applying to some b schools but i have a story i did my undergrad in civil engineering and then decided to switch career because of my passion to understand textiles i did my postgrad in apparel and textile design from nid india which is one of the best design schools in the world after my graduation i joined a company that works in textile craft sector i joined as a designer and became head designer for apparel division in a short span of time 2 yrs i left that company to work even more closely with artisans at grassroot level and so eventually i worked with some non profits in textile sector later in late 2007 i founded a small company which would work on social entrepreneurship model now not so good part of the story i got married in may07 and moved to boston eventually as my husband is working here i applied to top four b schools last year with a severe time constraint unfortunately everything was going wrong for me last year in spite of constantly scoring in 720 730 range in gmat practice tests i scored 610 first time and even lower second time in my real gmats the second test was a day before my application deadlines although i do not question the gmat but i am in a numb state to understand what did i do so wrong i plan to take it again in coming august anyway so coming to the real point i am planning to apply again and the one school that has actually inspired me to do mba is stanford i am keen to work as a social entrepreneur and therefore stanford is my top choice unfortunately it is a tough school to get in i am trying to be realistic about my candidacy i do not know alumni from such schools and thus i thought of writing to you i took an initial service from an admission consultants service today and i was told that there were two big concerns in my application for stanford first i am older than what stanford would prefer second obviously gmat i know you too would not have definite answers to whether i stand a chance for stanford but still i would be glad if you you could give me any kind of insight as you can tell i have been really passionate about stanford but i do not want to be completely unrealistic and build dreams that hold no future till now i was hopeful of my candidacy i am feeling quite low right now because there are things that i wont be able to change in my application last year has been the biggest mistake of my life i just shouldnt have worked for my application in that kind of time constraint but i cant change it now i dont know really what to ask you at this point but i seriously need some insights any kind that you might think of i hope you would find time to reply to me i would really appreciate your valuable time and insights i am realizing importance of your blog more at this moment of crisis and could not have appreciated more earlier ij

6516863 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments paranoia and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its control
6516864 to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion
6516865 wen once said that people can turn to him if they are having problems
6516866 when i read it i couldnt believe it was her who wrote the letter
6516867 i decided she was already grown up although i cannot say i feel optimistic about the future if no one struggles for the right to speak out our next generation will continue to eat bitterness
6516868 the problem is the greens think it is unfair to have the agriculture and transport sectors left out of the scheme for some time yet
6516869 for a nation that has shown a marked reluctance to engage with the campaigns to mitigate climate change at least at the highest political levels the endorsement of tim flannery as australian of the year last year is a remarkable personal tribute
6516870 security forces arrested him when he tried to enter nouadhibou and turned him over to the police who are bringing him to the capital now
6516871 preparing a coup to be carried out on august 9

6516873 spend a lot of money writing software and creating databases and give everything away pay for it by selling ads
6516874 market really sexy consumer electronics devices which you sell for a lot of money then sell people content to put onto those consumer electronics devices
6516875 his lower back has been bothering him since early july
6516876 byrd added that he had no superstitions about the number 36 just that he liked it and had worn it for a long time its involved in some of my passwords on the computer so if i switched numbers id have to change all that up no
6516877 the two belgian nationals fendry morpier and stan pattyn had arrived in the city from kolkata to travel to brussels on august 7
6516878 we are investigating if they have committed any similar offences in the past
6516879 the cash was paid in the form of a bank draft drawn in favour of basant kumar rout and sent in doras address i have documents to prove it
6516880 the woman had even threatened me with dire consequences if i opposed chinmays relationship with her
6516881 now where could it be i saw it here before
6516882 the amish are expanding their presence in american states far beyond pennsylvania dutch country as they search for affordable farmland to accommodate a population that has nearly doubled in the past 16 years
6516883 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6516884 logramos inmunizar a 102 000 animales con la habilitaci n de m s de 600 puntos pero nos falta un 40 por ciento 68 000 de nuestra meta trazada 170 000 ya que en algunos barrios como villa victoria y urkupi a estaban de fiesta y sus due os no llevaron a sus mascotas
6516885 comenzamos por las partes altas o m s alejadas de los macrodistritos y pedimos a los propietarios su colaboraci n porque si logramos vacunar a todos los perros de la ciudad podremos evitar la propagaci n de la rabia canina ya que hasta la fecha se han presentado algo de 17 casos
6516886 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6516887 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6516888 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6516889 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6516890 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6516891 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6516892 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6516893 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6516894 you dont have control over what happens the creator does
6516895 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominums where ill have them get to you
6516896 cest un accord tr s sophistiqu nous avons fait preuve de flexibilit et lirak aussi
6516897 cest un accord important qui permettra lirak et aux etats unis de poursuivre leur coop ration en tablissant les fondations qui renforceront les acquis nous travaillons comme des partenaires et personne plus que les etats unis est content de voir lemergence dune souverainet irakienne
6516898 cest la version la plus achev e de tous les sofa sign s entre les etats unis et un autre pays
6516899 nous esp rions conclure laccord avant mais cela a pris beaucoup de temps cependant aujourdhui nous sommes tr s tr s proches dun accord
6516900 pourrait intervenir d s le mois de juin si les conditions le permettent
6516901 nous avons un texte mais ce nest pas laccord d finitif tous les sujets ont t abord s
6516902 nous appelons les plus hautes autorit s du gouvernement irakien ne pas signer laccord et nous appelons galement la fin de loccupation
6516903 sarkozy cest le seul qui a t oblig de passer par lelys e pour devenir premier ministre
6516904 nous avons re u une notification des russes par les canaux militaires disant quils avaient d cid darr ter les op rations militaires de coop ration internationale entre la russie et les pays de lotan
6516905 tout d pend des priorit s de lotan si ces priorit s vont un soutien inconditionnel au r gime en faillite du pr sident g orgien saakachvili et si le prix quils les pays de lotan sont pr ts payer est la rupture des relations avec la russie ce nest pas notre choix
6516906 je ne peux pas imaginer dans les circonstances actuelles que nous nous engagions dans une coop ration militaire avec les russes tant que la situation en g orgie nest pas r solue
6516907 le processus formel dint gration a t lanc avec l tablissement de cette commission
6516908 sarkozy cest le seul qui a t oblig de passer par lelys e pour devenir premier ministre
6516909 this is a dream come true for me i have signed a four year deal with virtus bologna which includes a pretty good buy out to nba that we were able to negogiate salary is as good as it wouldve been in the nba
6516910 along with all the contract offers from europe many nba teams were also interested but philadelphia drafted koponen as the 30th pick in the first round of the 2007 europe as a better option than getting little playing time in the nba and also playing perhaps in the d league on the other hand my agent told me that more than ten nba teams wouldve signed me if i wouldve been able to leave
6516911 the acquisition of boykins tells a whole lot about how high the goals for the team are

6516913 i lifted my head and all i saw were scattered bodies
6516914 the plane left the gate for takeoff at 1 20pm but after we got to the take off zone the pilot apologised and said he would have to return because of a technical problem
6516915 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6516916 its the closest to hell that ive seen the bodies were boiling hot we burnt ourselves collecting them
6516917 knowing the plane was bad it took off with my seven year old niece
6516918 i think what a lot of people here in spain will want to know and certainly the relatives of those who perished on the plane is if there was a technical issue with the flight which delayed its take off initially and it was then given the go ahead to take off why was that
6516919 what was the technical issue which caused the delay and why was the go ahead then given for the plane to at least try to take off and head for gran canaria
6516920 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6516921 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6516922 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6516923 there are discussions going on right now and we are putting together a public statement
6516924 the first real stereo 3 d for the home will be via blu ray and for that you need a standard format
6516925 if everything goes perfectly this could happen in 2010 or 2011 but it never goes like that
6516926 people come out and tell us that they appreciate us being there and they appreciate what were trying to do
6516927 and the ones who dont appreciate what were trying to do are usually the guys we are detaining at 2 in the morning
6516928 any murderer is going to have clout with a potential victim but the extremists are losing that with the people to a certain extent
6516929 they have changed their operations from night time to day time to avoid us they dont own the night we do
6516930 they dont want them chasing their daughters influencing their sons
6516931 the people are getting tired of that stuff and i dont think their influence is that big here any more
6516932 he wasnt trying to give us a lot of baloney he was laying it straight and he trusted us to be able to have that conversation without fear or reprisal he even told us where the bad guys were and everything
6516933 our mission differentiates every night but our main goal is to clean up the streets and help rebuild abu tshir and give abu tshir back to the people so they can live a free life
6516934 right now it seems like nobody is out here but we know that extremists are somewhere around
6516935 they scatter like the rats when they see the headlights
6516936 that is our only focus no matter what it takes to get it done
6516937 they acted like there was a curfew in effect even though there wasnt they didnt mingle we didnt see the kids out playing we didnt see smiles i think they were really scared of what they had coming
6516938 the strategic planning put us exactly where we are at today even though the public and a lot of government officials didnt have faith it really pulled us through
6516939 we try to keep them updated as far as what we know is happening and what is in the works
6516940 if we can keep them in a good flow of information we hope that buys a little more patience and that patience is our survival
6516941 these are some of the best iraqi national police i have ever worked with the best iraqi security forces i have ever worked with
6516942 i do believe that theyre getting it and i believe theyre getting it from our example
6516943 the national police also go out on their own they do their own patrols
6516944 they are really high speed i would compare them to a joe the way that they react is like a regular u s army soldier
6516945 but as we started doing close encounters and started talking to the people i dont think that reputation is true any more
6516946 were always going to have spikes in enemy activity but i think overall were going to be able to maintain
6516947 people are changing theyre accepting our help and at the same time they want us out of here so i think they are starting to realize that if they work with us well help them a lot more
6516948 his lower back has been bothering him since early july
6516949 byrd added that he had no superstitions about the number 36 just that he liked it and had worn it for a long time its involved in some of my passwords on the computer so if i switched numbers id have to change all that up no

6516952 if in fact a person is generating enough packets that theyre the ones creating that situation we will manage that consumer for the overall good of all of our consumers
6516953 the democrats really needed hillary to win and not as vp
6516954 we could have had hillary rocketing through the democratic convention
6516955 when voters are asked which candidate could better manage the economy
6516956 turning a four point deficit in july s reuters zobgy poll into a 49 percent to 40 percent lead
6516957 delivering a more populist message that further highlights his economic differences with senator john mccain
6516958 the biggest reason why this race remains close in this dem leaning political environment is because of obamas inability to close the deal with some of clintons supporters
6516959 more massively than any campaign in the history of american politics on the ground game
6516960 everyone in the political class is now talking about the possibility of obama shocking the world and picking hillary clinton as his running mate
6516961 we play in much bigger bigger storm few days ago
6516962 newsweek very important and big magazine in the u s must get this picture i was here at 8 a m forgot to get sticker
6516963 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy
6516964 unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6516965 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6516966 at the end of the day there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever
6516967 i am thinking about getting my own firm this year
6516968 if i dont do anything ill just have this as a new years resolution each year and get to be 80 and still not the owner of my small web design firm
6516969 the chinese army again fired on a crowd on monday august 18 in the kham region in eastern tibet
6516970 he clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6516971 we have been told that there have been casualties but we are not able to verify what casualties means whether people have been killed or whether they have been injured
6516972 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital lhasa alone
6516973 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6516974 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned
6516975 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
6516976 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6516977 real autonomy because we know what chinese style autonomy is a trap
6516978 his lower back has been bothering him since early july
6516979 byrd added that he had no superstitions about the number 36 just that he liked it and had worn it for a long time its involved in some of my passwords on the computer so if i switched numbers id have to change all that up no
6516980 it was important to me not to make it a quasi realistic experience to make it an effective coney island attraction
6516981 the whole purpose of the project was to investigate and try to figure it out and better understand what it meant what waterboarding meant just for me
6516982 is that it that was a waste of my money
6516983 i want the last 30 seconds of my life back
6516984 a pretty gruesome thing to put on display for people
6516985 his lower back has been bothering him since early july
6516986 byrd added that he had no superstitions about the number 36 just that he liked it and had worn it for a long time its involved in some of my passwords on the computer so if i switched numbers id have to change all that up no
6516987 han sido pocas oportunidades de demostrar lo que significa para m esa camiseta as que tras reflexionar mucho prefiero anunciar que con el actual equipo t cnico de la selecci n francesa prefiero dedicar todo mi tiempo a la fiorentina
6516988 this is a small project that probably a very few of you know about we are porting myst to the iphone ok before some of you start groaning this is an outside funded project that is keeping a few developers employed but it is really more than that it is an interesting and fun project this is also a very small team with three of us which includes derek rand not randy and myself
6516989 his lower back has been bothering him since early july

6516993 the unusual living arrangements documented in the new sunday night series off the radar saw the comedian up sticks to a lifestyle block in kaukapakapa foregoing such modern luxuries as electricity and supermarkets
6516994 i thought it would be easier tv lies to us
6516995 a lot of these programmes on tv have people who are terribly proficient they plant a garden and two weeks later theres this lush abundance i like to think that theres a bit more realism in mine
6516996 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6516997 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6516998 we still have a bit more time left and have decided to draw another number to take a group photo with the cast
6516999 his lower back has been bothering him since early july
6517000 byrd added that he had no superstitions about the number 36 just that he liked it and had worn it for a long time its involved in some of my passwords on the computer so if i switched numbers id have to change all that up no

6517003 what were looking at the moment is the largest number of households in fuel poverty that weve had for the last 10 years or so and we expect something like five million households to be in fuel poverty this winter
6517004 its about 20 percent of all households in the uk and we havent seen that as i say for more than 10 years
6517005 another domino has fallen one after another energy providers are telling customers to brace themselves for an expensive winter
6517006 the brakes have failed on the energy market the results are calamitous
6517007 protection for the poorest effective competition and rational wholesale markets should be limiting the impact on consumers clearly they are doing no such thing
6517008 in the long term government needs to drive a super energy efficiency campaign for new and existing properties the energy market has hard wired fuel poverty into the system government could reverse that by building energy efficiency into the fabric of all our homes
6517009 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6517010 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6517011 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6517012 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6517013 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6517014 the conventions provide a big national spotlight for both candidates a chance to have the stage when voters are actually paying attention
6517015 it is an incredible opportunity to tell the american people your vision for the country and what you will do as president and that can change the dynamics of the race
6517016 they are finished with just telling voters about themselves now they have to show voters they are ready to be president
6517017 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6517018 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left
6517019 his lower back has been bothering him since early july

6517021 poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
6517022 how would we have reacted if moscow had brought western europe into the warsaw pact established bases in mexico and panama put missile defense radars and rockets in cuba and joined with china to build pipelines to transfer mexican and venezuelan oil to pacific ports for shipment to asia
6517023 for a decade some of us have warned about the folly of getting into russias space and getting into russias face the chickens of democratic imperialism have now come home to roost in tbilisi
6517024 i can look you in the eye and tell you this was never a murder for hire plot
6517025 id rather be in the position im in now and even do life in prison than be involved in bringing harm to much less killing anyone
6517026 slap in the face to people who have been willing to come and testify in a murder case
6517027 we are integrating land maritime air special forces operations and selected interagency organizations in a realistic and challenging training environment
6517028 everything you will see in this exercise emphasizes and focuses on the multinational
6517029 we are a region that works together as a coalition it is not the u s it is not nato it is the coalition of our region and we take a regional approach to everything thats one of the underlying themes of this exercise
6517030 in the event of a real world situation requiring a multinational effort the groundwork were laying here will be invaluable
6517031 the panama canal is a great template for us to work on because every country has an interest in it because it is so critical to commerce
6517032 this is what we should be doing around the world all the time in every region that we are in working collaboratively in a cooperative security environment
6517033 that is probably the greatest deterrent we can have building relationships with countries around the world
6517034 so i think that is one of the bedrocks of this panamax
6517035 that is why this exercise is such an extraordinary training opportunity in my mind it is all about engagement with the other nations
6517036 that is an important message and everybody is doing extraordinarily well
6517037 this is a chance for these partners to work together not only to participate but to be the leadership
6517038 they are not followers they are leaders which in my mind is really important
6517039 we are not in the lead in any of the missions the key here is that they are being run by the region and we are facilitating in my mind that makes this a really extraordinary exercise
6517040 of course there is also a place for dad but
6517041 yes i recognize this is his child too but its more mine
6517042 why would you want natural birth anymore than having natural dentistry
6517043 people think that in countries so bright so rich they dont have this kind of problem
6517044 in some schools in the rural areas children dont want to go to the toilets because they are too dirty
6517045 its taboo they are ashamed to talk about toilets and they dont really know how bad the situation is in their poorest areas
6517046 about them im not concerned well surely learn to regret our misdeeds im worried about our mitzvahs when will we repent for our mitzvahs
6517047 you are a righteous man who does not sin and you have surely repented many times over for any of your youthful indiscretions why then do you annually subject yourself to a rigorous month of exile what are you repenting for
6517048 by relating an incident which occurred during one of my elul exiles
6517049 on one of my trips i was hosted by a wonderful jewish innkeeper
6517050 suddenly i saw the innkeeper fighting his way through the throngs when he reached me i saw that tears were pouring down his distraught face rebbe he sobbed please forgive me
6517051 forgive you i incredulously asked for what you couldnt have been kinder to me
6517052 every day we study more torah and we gain a new understanding and a new appreciation for the creator every day we must repent for the way we treated g d yesterday yes we were kind to the a mighty yesterday but if we would have known him yesterday like we know him today
6517053 in the six hundredth year of the sixth millennium the gates of wisdom from above will be opened as well as the fountains of wisdom from below and the world will be prepared to be elevated in the seventh millennium
6517054 the glory of g d will be revealed and all flesh will see together that the mouth of the l rd has spoken
6517055 g d looked into the torah and created the world
6517056 tamar frankel notes several studies which suggest to her that the
6517057 this has been wonderful it has brought a kind of excitement into our married lives we were very bored with each other tired of each other our physical relationship was becoming monotonous with no excitement this was like a magic potion in all seriousness rabbi this has saved our marriage not just the physical part everything
6517058 because excessive intimacy can cause boredom therefore the torah ordains that we should separate for those additional seven days so that a woman shall be as beloved as she was on the day she stood under the bridal canopy
6517059 gilah rinah ditzah vchedvah ahavah achvah shalom vreut mirth glad song pleasure delight love brotherhood peace and companionship
6517060 being now as were both 72 its only once a day
6517061 i wish i was the rookie i was running everywhere
6517062 suge knight came in once and i got really scared
6517063 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6517064 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6517065 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6517066 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6517067 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
6517068 we thought wed stay away from beijing we honestly didnt come here to cause trouble
6517069 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way
6517070 illustrations explore various themes beloved of young children including numbers rhymes and games animals fantasy and images from everyday life
6517071 the seemingly rigid format of a picture book is actually an incredibly expansive canvas on which anything can happen renowned childrens book artist david wiesner will discuss how he came to childrens literature after a childhood spent reading comic books looking at art watching monster movies and endlessly playing in the wilds of suburban new jersey all of which had a huge influence on his work

6517078 the most common form plaque psoriasis appears as raised red patches or lesions covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells called scale
6517079 it seems that psoriasis is most common in caucasians and slightly less common in african americans worldwide psoriasis is most common in scandinavia and other parts of northern europe it appears to be far less common among asians and is rare in native americans
6517080 no special blood tests or diagnostic tools exist to diagnose psoriasis the physician or other health care provider usually examines the affected skin and decides if it is from psoriasis less often the physician examines a piece of skin biopsy under the microscope
6517081 the loss of a home community and security during a natural disaster such as katrina only magnifies the loss of a sense of place
6517082 reestablishing a sense of place and subsequently place attachment among both returning and new residents is paramount to the citys future success
6517083 in the aftermath of katrina most of the population that contributed to the citys world class culture remains in diaspora with former residents in nearly every state
6517084 the culture of new orleans is very much at risk when the people who make and preserve it are scattered and living in a sea of uncertainty and when the places where artists and traditional bearers live where they make and practice their art forms are largely destroyed
6517085 that is lacking in other places across the nation recognition that root culture matters
6517086 when you have no one there to make a place in this space whos going to make the gumbo you have to have a cultural sense of place
6517087 because culture will be an economic stimulus and possibly the most relied on sector in the region business and city planners will have to avoid the occurrence of disneyfication of the urban and social environments
6517088 exposed the social issues of segregation poverty and minority marginalization

6517090 the society and culture of new orleans may never be the same again
6517091 as different people bring cultural and ethnic values of the city the cultural landscape will change to be more inclusive
6517092 the physical landscape is the foundation for other landscape development because it presents the natural characteristics that society employs
6517093 we need to take steps to reeducate and rebuild our connection with the natural world as opposed to attempting to conquer it

6517096 i still believe the fundamentals of our economy are strong weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment or so many of the other health care
6517097 can i point out that your idea of radical left is centre right in europe
6517098 well be lucky if we avoid several years of 1970s style stagflation
6517099 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
6517100 mccain pledges to balance the budget by 2012 not by increasing taxes but by vetoing all pork barrel spending and curbing outlays for social security and medicare
6517101 mccains overall goal is to balance the budget by the end of his second term says economic adviser douglas holtz eakin that would be 2017
6517102 said that if the war and the personal and corporate tax cuts that mr mccain advocated added to the federal deficit and debt so be it i would like the next president not to talk about deficit reduction he said
6517103 that plan when appropriately phased in as it has always been intended to be will bring the budget to balance by the end of his first term
6517104 but were not going to have a balanced budget before you leave office in your first term
6517105 well that still should be a goal but the goal the goal right now is to get the economy going again
6517106 you have to pay for that somehow or you are george bush iii
6517107 how do the democrats propose to balance a budget when their platform clearly outlines massive increases in the federal budget
6517108 inflation is rising real wages are declining unemployment is increasing cost of food is rising optimism about economy is declining foreclosures are still increasing
6517109 fundamentalist have strong hunkering down instincts despite all signs they are wrong in their world view perspectives
6517110 the american economy has been getting pummeled by the one two punch of soaring oil prices and the collapse of the housing bubble but a stubbornly resilient economy has failed to produce the two quarters of declining output that have become the focus of the medias recession watch

6517113 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6517114 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6517115 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6517116 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6517117 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6517118 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6517119 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine

6517174 many are bright social creative children who welcome the opportunity to combine active physical involvement with academic learning
6517175 yet their opportunity to get out of their wheelchairs and practice physical skills while learning is limited without the help of standing tall

6517187 old friends are reunited every day and thank god for that
6517188 but whats unusual about this situation is that my husbands friend who he had known in high school as jeff miller had gone on to become a leader of the american buddhist movement and a best selling author with a new name of surya das
6517189 as a very spiritual person myself i was totally curious to meet the guy and to hear stories of what les was like as a kid and the reunion turned out to be a warm surprise
6517190 he turned out to be a very accessible person and a real sports nut like both me and les our apartment has views to the west and so we all shared a beautiful sunset

6517193 it is the longest running and most experienced antiques and collectibles site on the internet and has a great staff combined we will have more than 1 million visitors a month to our web pages
6517194 our acquisition of goantiques will accelerate our growth by introducing the antique dealer community to worthpoint
6517195 more importantly it will introduce thousands of antique dealers to the thousands of homeowners who come to the worthpoint site daily looking to sell some of their possessions
6517196 fifteen years ago my dream was to serve the antiques market with jim as president weve come a long way and now with worthpoint we can go even further
6517197 this is a good match worthpoint will give us the added resources we need to expand our marketplace and provide additional value to our buyers and sellers the people looking for assistance with estates and collections who come to our site will benefit greatly from having access to worthpoints rapidly expanding team of experts
6517198 worthpoint represents the future of collecting worldwide and we are happy to be part of that exciting future

6517389 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds

6517681 wow they really look like they are excited to get their picture made and more than likely they are going to love what they see when they are developed

6517686 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6517687 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6517688 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway

6517693 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6517694 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6517695 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6517696 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6517697 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6517698 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6517699 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6517700 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6517701 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6517702 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6517703 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6517704 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6517705 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6517706 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6517707 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6517708 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6517709 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6517710 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

6517712 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6517713 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit

6517716 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

6517727 y las mu ecas tan anchas como la cintura de un hombre

6517738 we are generally pleased however that the commission essentially has agreed with our final plan concerning additional wind and solar power and our plans to close two of our power plants

6517748 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6517749 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6517750 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6517751 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway

6517756 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6517757 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6517758 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6517759 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6517760 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6517761 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6517762 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6517763 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6517764 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6517765 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6517766 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

6517769 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya

6517805 in making its decision microsoft recognized what we in iowa have known all along our work force and quality of life makes iowa the best place for business
6517806 i am absolutely committed to bringing high quality innovative jobs to iowa and with microsofts help were doing just that
6517807 microsoft has a very significant site selection process looking for the very best places in the world to locate our facilities
6517808 microsoft selected iowa after evaluating a number of locations across the country
6517809 iowa provided the best all around combination of attributes that we evaluate in an important selection such as this
6517810 iowa will be a key hub in that infrastructure moving forward
6517811 microsoft serves over 500 million unique users in its web properties every single month
6517812 there will be 500 million new people visiting iowa through the auspices of this data center

6517827 if there is insufficient media scrutiny it is of arudous outlandish claims
6517828 i think much of his campaign is faux because most of the places he is going after are in hokkaido trying to protect themselves from drunken russians i have bathed and or stayed at well over 200 onsen establishments and been stopped only once
6517829 attempting to monster japan into george wallaces alabama arudou trivializes the real life brutal discrimination that still disfigures our world and the heroic campaigners who have put themselves on the line to fight it

6517843 here is jack vance cordwainer smith and tiptree sheldon come again reborn in one wonderful talent
6517844 our quarterback position will be a tireless battle for a starting role
6517845 we have two true setters with very different backgrounds and very different demeanors both had a strong spring and proved to be great competitors
6517846 allanah has a fantastic relationship with her team and staff
6517847 shes a tireless worker that i expect to be one of our fittest athletes in fall camp she brings an aura of leadership and stability to the position that this developing team needs
6517848 she runs a quick game and has great size for our front row defensive game kasey is very even keeled and will keep the flow consistent in intense matches
6517849 with a very similar team returning from last year i made some position changes to strengthen our charge on offense
6517850 we now have the potential for a line that can play a mobile and powerful game at the net i expect consistency consistency and more consistency from this position in 2008
6517851 in week one of my spring training with the team i moved lacey to the outside
6517852 she has the size and power to compete with the best in our conference hard work was done to gain consistency and strength for sustainability in that role i expect her to be our most imposing force at the net
6517853 competing with lacey for a starting position will be tairyn and newcomer bailey platt
6517854 tairyn spent the spring developing her arsenal shes a dynamic hitter thats learning to open up the net with her speed i also expect her to come into her own as a serve receive passer
6517855 bailey is a local newcomer that has great touch on the ball
6517856 she has a ton of spunk and im sure shell be in the running for a starting role were looking for strong defense and passing out of her right away
6517857 great progress was made in our short spring in a position that lacked luster we see such potential in this position to move from just blockers to one of our more imposing offensive threats
6517858 she was one of our hardest working athletes in the spring and soaked up information like a sponge expect to see her emerge as a leader and perhaps our most inspirational player
6517859 lauren is gaining speed and efficiency with her new footwork as her competitive spirit emerges look out for a player that surprises opponents she has fantastic control off one foot but will do more with her expanded repertoire
6517860 brianna has good size and a strong arm for a middle blocker her powerful swing and impressive blocking presence will be of great help
6517861 we made some moves and put our mobile hitters with size and speed to hit first tempo balls on the right i look for big blocks and a quick offense out of this side lexi made a move from left to right in week one i noticed her speed and blocking presence and made the move shes come into her own there and enjoys the open looks at the net i expect consistent exciting play from her this year
6517862 jit has nice blocking presence and a quick snap for first tempo swings she worked hard on her endurance and speed in the spring so im looking for her to play an important back up role this year
6517863 we have such terrific depth and talent in the back court
6517864 each player brings something very different and vital to our serve receive and floor defense each of them has a bit of experience at their back and were some of the most eager to learn during spring training im expecting a real team effort from our defensive specialists and absolute consistency
6517865 she impressed her teammates this spring with her changes in leadership and work ethic shes a true bulldog and is at home in our middle middle defense taking hard balls from every direction shes one of our most talented volleyball players and the entire group is looking to her as a leader
6517866 adding constant and what i like to call smooth passing to our court is megan moss
6517867 megan has so much talent efficiency and speed for her position i think her career is about to boom shes worked hard on strength and playing the role so im looking forward to watching her develop this season has found a very comfortable home in the right back shes one of our most fearless defenders that can handle a hard hit from any angle and has so much positive energy to add to a match i know kelly will compete for the best dig to kill ratio on the team with her control off power
6517868 adding even more depth to our position is red shirt freshman
6517869 sarah is coming off a tough injury but is working hard to gain strength on her injured side sarah plays low balls well and has a strong serve so i know shell make an impact in any of the three back row positions
6517870 im eager to host the fresno state invitational and battle it out with three strong california opponents in the save mart center
6517871 with a new configuration for volleyball matches our fans will be engaged in a much more intimate exciting environment than theyve seen in years previous the tournament will be a debut for our new environment and a team similar in personnel but different in energy and work ethic both are sure to make fans proud and entertained
6517872 its a well balanced slate with matches i certainly expect to win and matches that i certainly hope to win
6517873 with competitors from the pac 10 to those in the midwest well see where weve improved and what were on the road to becoming
6517874 its easy to create a good schedule in california with high ranking teams surrounding us i think its important to experience different competitors with different styles to be balanced and ready for post season play
6517875 it will be good if we can get wins in those unfamiliar places to prove our level of physicality at fresno state and within the western athletic conference
6517876 i hope to fill the save mart in similar fashion one day
6517877 your tailback has been gaining more than eight yards per carry how has the offensive line worked to help open these holes for him

6517901 dedicated to fighting the abuse of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs among americas youth
6517902 what we found is that even with all the publicity thats gone on with steroids over the last number of years 85 of the kids teenagers still have not had a coach a parent a teacher talk to them about the dangers of these drugs and these kids are unfortunately starting as early as 13 or 14 years old with this stuff
6517903 its peer pressure primarily but its pressure to make the team coaches applying pressure kids are applying pressure to themselves there is pressure to get the scholarship there is pressure in everything these kids do they see their heroes in whatever sport they are in they are not dumb they know how the guys and the gals have achieved their objectives they have a substantial portion of their buddies fooling around with this stuff so they think why not no one is talking to them about why they shouldnt
6517904 you do have the youngsters that might be out in front of the rest of them because of their growth cycle and you do have some kids that are throwing hard and the rest of them think they have to catch up with that thats were the problem arises physically they cant and a lot of them resort to drugs to try to bridge the gap
6517905 its stupid but then you have coaches that and i grew up with a family of pitchers with kids 12 amp 13 years old trying to get their kids to throw curve balls sliders i am just not sure if they know any better or not but they the coaches are ruining these kids pitching career but beyond the pitching it is the drugs that the kids are getting into that we are concerned about
6517906 a lot of cases are like that i talk to coaches and they claim not to know about this steroids problem they somehow know that their kids are not doing steroids but they dont know the basics about the drugs so i get confused if you dont know you need to be trained and an understanding that your kids are not doing drugs these coaches are not properly equipped to train one of the things we are arguing for in a broader picture is that a lot of the high school and sandlot coaches need to be certified you have got to go to school and pass a test in order to cut someones hair or to do a ladys nails but we got coaches turned loose with a 13 14 amp 15 year old kids that havent had to pass anything other than tell someone they played football basketball or baseball in high school its crazy it really is and something has got to be done about it
6517907 my youngest son taylor died from anabolic steroids and we his family decided to do something about it we didnt know anything about these drugs we had no idea how prevalent it was nor how dangerous and as a result knew there were a lot of other parents that did not know that either so our whole purpose in life now is education raising awareness and to raise the warning flags we need to let people know that this stuff is going on
6517908 not until right at the very end taylor quit doing steroids and of course what we learned is that the most dangerous time for a young kid at least emotionally is when they stop doing steroids your body has stopped producing testosterone and every reader who will be reading this story will know what testosterone does to a young boy normally when he is 13 or 14 years old just imagine pulling the plug on that and you got a kid running around with zero male hormones just severe depression and it wound up getting to him
6517909 the garibaldis yes i know them well he was a starting right fielder for the usc trojans and was being scouted by major league teams one of the scouts told him son you have all five tools that it takes to play major league baseball you are just missing one thing you need to gain 20 or 25 pounds and he went to a trainer at his college and a few days later they lined him up with anabolic steroids he gained the weight and about one year later he took a gun and shot himself very very sad and totally avoidable if educated and well meaning folks had been involved
6517910 taylor died five years and one month ago and we started the foundation about four years ago major league baseball has been our biggest supporter and in this case for three summers this being the first we are working with the athletic trainers to put on education programs for kids in all 30 big league parks
6517911 like a traditional baseball clinic they are going to rotate through stations at my station i am going to talk to them about the dangers of performance enhancing drugs and why not to fool with this stuff at the other stations the athletic trainers strength coaches and some of the big league players will be showing these kids how to achieve their objectives the right way the proper way through diet exercise and hard work a lot of these kids dont want to hear the words hard work so they will get a multiple message not just why not to do drugs but something a lot of coaches are not trained to do to properly show the kid how to get bigger you tell a kid to get bigger and then the coach having not been trained in diet and exercise cant show the kids how to do it properly so you end up with a 16 year old turned loose on his own devices half of his buds are doing steroids what do you think he is inclined to do
6517912 we are making some impact not nearly what we like our objective as a foundation which we are trying to kick off now is an effort to try to reach 10 000 high schools in the country which is the overwhelming majority of the kids in fact we have a couple of meetings with a couple of federal government agencies while here in washington we are out trying to raise private money so we can field the team that can instruct in these clinics not 75 to 100 kids at a time as here in dc but hopefully an auditorium full in every single high school in america
6517913 and fully understanding that is quite the task but somebody has got to do it and its not happening now
6517914 i think we have made a difference already between ourselves the garibaldis the marreros and several other families that have been through this great tragedy we have been to congress to share the needs we have been in the newspapers we are working with the commissioner of baseball we have raised awareness quite a bit but its just scary that even with all of that progress you still have got 85 of the kids not reached out to nobody has delivered the message so we have a lot of work to do and i am confident we get this important job done
6517915 its not been easy we have our moments as a family but knowing i am out here trying to make a difference from a personal tragedy and knowing many others are living through the same pain if the taylor hooton foundation can stop other youngsters from going down this same tragic road then all is not lost
6517916 it would have been really hard to see someone else play harry potter

6517920 this is an exceptional important step particularly for new jerseyans who struggle with property taxes as well as all of the other rising levels of inflationary costs
6517921 on the state level we remain vigilant in our dedication to property tax relief for homeowners
6517922 over 600 000 here in new jersey own property pay property taxes but do not itemize on their income taxes
6517923 as a senior citizen on a fixed income this is certainly going to help with our property taxes
6517924 het grote probleem van de watervoetafdruk in belgi is dat 80 procent van ons watergebruik buiten belgi plaats vindt door de import van producten en goederen
6517925 veel producten zoals koffie katoen of meel worden zelfs gekweekt in de droogste gebieden ter wereld waar de waterreserves bijna of zeker onder druk staan
6517926 de meeste mensen zijn zich zelfs niet bewust van het feit dat het voedsel en de vezels die zij gebruiken grote hoeveelheden water nodig hebben en dit alles staat los van het water dat we gebruiken om te drinken om ons te wassen of om het gras te besproeien

6517939 sadly it seems that certain roman officials in poland are not aware of the position or policies of their own church
6517940 yes we understand that religious zealots and fanatical politicians will seek to deny the validity of this church by frightening the faithful about our unconditional acceptance of people who are gay bisexual transgendered divorced remarried questioning or any other artificial and irrelevant barrier or label used by the church to separate people from god
6517941 unlike some traditional churches we welcome all people to the table of the lord saint and sinner alike with no judgment so that they may equally share in the most holy sacraments of the church
6517942 most importantly we welcome and embrace those people whom the church has harmed through a regular and intentional pattern of ignorance prejudice discrimination or worse yet indifference
6517943 a true church is a place where the spirit of god fills the hearts of the people and inspires them on to great works of mercy charity and love
6517944 like many other communities of faith the reformed catholic church is seeking to be the living hands and feet of our lord
6517945 offers his full support for the eternal rest of the deceased
6517946 likewise i beg of our lord to send the condolences of his holiness benedict xvi to the families of the deceased along with his spiritual closeness and desire for a quick and full recovery of the injured in this unfortunate accident
6517947 in these moments of sadness gives us the comfort of his apostolic blessing as a sign of consolation and hope in the risen lord
6517948 what we see is a picture of total domination by the cablecos
6517949 we have to go back to the third quarter of 2003 to find a period where the telcos added more revenue generating units than the cablecos in canada

6517970 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6517971 it all depends on nato priorities if they prefer to support the bankrupt saakashvili regime to partnership with russia that will not be our fault he said
6517972 together with the entire diocesan community profoundly lament the accident which took place this afternoon at the barajas airport and they pray to the lord of life for the eternal repose of the great many who died as well as for the recovery of the wounded

6517974 ask all parishes and christian communities of madrid to join together in intense personal and liturgical prayer that god in his infinite mercy might receive those who died into a place of light and of peace and grant health to the wounded and comfort with the hope of eternal life to all the family members

6517983 as long as problems for the banking industry remain limited to residential housing and development we could say the issues are contained and there is some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of rising credit costs given the stabilization of early delinquencies and new problem loans

6517991 no ocr regulation should be interpreted to impinge upon rights protected under the first amendment to the u s constitution or to require recipients to enact or enforce codes that punish the exercise of such rights
6517992 all too often the proponents of campus restrictions on speech bizarrely have presented civil rights for women and minorities on the one hand and civil liberties on the other as somehow at odds with one another ocr recognizes that there is no inconsistency between civil liberties and civil rights and that civil liberties are a necessary precondition for the continued survival of civil rights
6517993 the offensiveness of a particular expression standing alone is not a legally sufficient basis to establish a hostile environment under the statutes enforced by ocr
6517994 h arassment must be sufficiently serious i e severe persistent or pervasive as to limit or deny a students ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program
6517995 a plaintiff must establish sexual harassment that is so severe pervasive and objectively offensive and that so undermines and detracts from the victims educational experience that he or she is effectively denied equal access to an institutions resources and opportunities
6517996 we will have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror
6517997 by the end of august 22 all forces of the russian federation will be within the area of responsibility of the russian peacekeepers
6517998 from a legal point of view we consider that the georgian side not having fulfilled its obligations and instead crudely violating them has lost the moral right to undertake the peacekeeping function

6518002 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6518003 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him
6518004 mummy why did those nasty meany mean national parks amp wildlife people kill baby colin
6518005 well sometimes animals even little baby whales get sick and sometimes we cant look after those animals no matter how hard we try sometimes sick animals die darling and sometimes when animals are very sick sick like colin the baby whale was we have to help them to go to sleep so they dont suffer in pain any more do you understand
6518006 yes like blacky my fat dog he got sick didnt he he had to go to sleep because he was sick
6518007 colin looked sick and he was hungry too blacky ate that whole bowl of food real fast remember that mummy just before blacky got sick that day when i was at school and you had him put to sleep remember that mummy two days before we moved to this new house

6518009 theres a lot of teams complaining right now that their bullpen is worn out
6518010 so here we come into september with a very strong bullpen a bullpen thats almost borderline rusty when other bullpens are borderline worn out
6518011 it has nothing to do with the game it doesnt matter how good anybody did at the plate
6518012 people have been saying at times were too good well we sit here and tell you guys that theres parity
6518013 you just dont see it well you saw it tonight thats what weve been trying to tell people all along
6518014 maybe people will get off our back and realize there is parity
6518015 i feel good and i dont feel tired at all
6518016 i have actually pitched five games over three days that has been quite tough too but not only was this tough physically this is the olympics its a top level game in addition to physical issues there are the mental issues at one point i thought my head was going to burst
6518017 ive always felt the rest of the world was getting better
6518018 i do know that ive been around the game long enough to respect everyone that we play sometimes the game looks easy for the u s and it really isnt
6518019 you dont want to lose on your gold medal day
6518020 eight years for possible reinstatement of the sport doesnt make any difference
6518021 this is our game and we wanted to win it
6518022 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6518023 its the greatest feeling its my first olympics and my first
6518024 the more minutes together the better we played and ive been working for nine months now with this team and it was about finding the rhythm and in the way we believed in attack
6518025 it is a hard moment i dont know what to say
6518026 it was not a lack of opportunities but rather it was a lack of patience on the one shot the usa had they scored and whoever scores the goal wins we lost focus after the americans scored
6518027 i usually fare well at the us open but ill have my hands full thats for sure
6518028 if youre going to point the finger point it at me
6518029 after we saw the men we were a little more pumped and wanted to do well for our country
6518030 its not my fault its not her fault its nobodys fault
6518031 we got a lot of track meet left a lot of events and right now we need to focus on them
6518032 a global conspiracy involving covert military operations bizarre genetic experiments and a mysterious organization known as gemini division
6518033 our goal was to try to focus on the moment not on way down the road
6518034 i mean people started talking national championship after the sugar bowl last year thats too long to be chewing on that bone so to speak
6518035 i told the players that this preseason hype could be a blessing or a curse
6518036 its a curse if you think it gives you a sense of entitlement to where you think you dont have to prepare it could be a blessing if you look at it as one of the greatest opportunities of your life and you put the work in to even be in position to have a chance
6518037 dealing with the expectations of the fans our bulldog fans always have high expectations
6518038 i think theres enough guys that have been through that that there will be at least the confidence that we can go on the road and win
6518039 i dont think theres any doubt its intensified the rivalry
6518040 but what intensified the rivalry is that we won ok i mean thats the reality
6518041 deeply conflicts whether or how the player sees the character as a sexual being
6518042 we are excited to be working more closely with npd and enterbrain

6518049 the signing of djibril shows how far this club has moved on since the end of last season
6518050 his experience will bring a lot to the squad and he will hopefully add some goals to the side he is known for scoring them as well as creating them
6518051 im really pleased to join a good club with good players sunderland is a club i think is going to achieve things they have big ambitions thats why i chose to come here i liked what the club had to say to me
6518052 more zombies on screen than you can shoot in a second
6518053 phillip was probably our co mvp with utah commit chris brown
6518054 not bad for a sophomore who played on the varsity
6518055 at this time it hard to say where he will play on the college level
6518056 the thing about phillip is hes shifty with the ball in his hands he can run and he can hit
6518057 phillip is also an outstanding all around athlete who was on the olympic development program for soccer
6518058 when it comes his time phillip will have a decision to make
6518059 the thing about phillip that we love is hes clutch
6518060 he kicked a game winning field goal against valencia last season
6518061 it was a 30 yarder and he was a 14 year old sophomore put in a pressure situation and he delivered that kind of tells you what kind of player he is phillip has the ability to rise to the occasion
6518062 phillip is definitely a guy who can play on the d i level
6518063 everybody who came by in the spring asked who is that kid and they were surprised that he was only a sophomore
6518064 phillip kind of reminds me of a wes welker type
6518065 actually it will be a tough decision between soccer and football
6518066 it will depend on what school likes me for what sport at that time i will probably talk to my parents
6518067 i have played soccer a lot longer i have only been playing football since my freshman year in high school like i said its going to be a tough decision

6518078 the most common form plaque psoriasis appears as raised red patches or lesions covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells called scale
6518079 it seems that psoriasis is most common in caucasians and slightly less common in african americans worldwide psoriasis is most common in scandinavia and other parts of northern europe it appears to be far less common among asians and is rare in native americans
6518080 no special blood tests or diagnostic tools exist to diagnose psoriasis the physician or other health care provider usually examines the affected skin and decides if it is from psoriasis less often the physician examines a piece of skin biopsy under the microscope
6518081 when the institutions rules are not followed then i will take immediate and appropriate action

6518086 in the competitions in the united states you look next to you and you see michael phelps
6518087 the public schools in chile they cant get a field to play on or a ball for basketball
6518088 theres no money for sports so the results are no surprise
6518089 the team is definitely on a high right now believing we were going to make a statement in the whole tournament
6518090 it didnt start like we wanted to but we just kept digging and getting better each game it was a full team effort and it was so special with everyone doing it together
6518091 when i was 6 years old i thought i was the only girl in the whole world who played soccer i wasnt allowed to play because i was a girl
6518092 back then i could never imagine to be a professional player or a professional coach now im sitting with a great player christie rampone and looking at her gold medal i am so proud
6518093 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6518094 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6518095 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6518096 in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6518097 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong
6518098 the breadth and quality of open source software continues to amaze us
6518099 weve singled out 60 products for bossies developer tools middleware firewalls and routers productivity apps crm and erp etc and were only scratching the surface when you look at all thats available and how good it is you start to think that someday all software will be free
6518100 we are pleased to be recognized as a leader in open source
6518101 strong adoption of our open source product has been the catalyst for our impressive year over year customer and revenue growth contributions from our community have also greatly enhanced our solution and enabled us to deliver deeper more relevant capabilities to our customers than our competition

6518103 we are pleased to have greg brenneman join our team
6518104 this is a significant milestone in our firms development and a natural extension of our relationship with greg which began with our investment in quiznos ccmp has always focused on creating value by improving our portfolio companies operations and not just through financial engineering gregs success as a hands on ceo who has turned around companies of the same size as those we target underscores this approach its telling that each of the companies greg has been involved with has continued to thrive and prosper for many years
6518105 as chairman greg will be an active full time partner working side by side with the other investment committee members and with me he will help develop portfolio company strategies complete transactions and most importantly he will mentor portfolio company managers
6518106 i am very proud to be joining steve and the terrific team at ccmp
6518107 ccmp has the dual benefit of being a relatively new organization founded as an independent entity in 2006 and having a legacy of many years of impressive results as jpmorgan partners
6518108 i have worked closely with steve and the team at ccmp over the past two years and i have a deep appreciation for their values their culture and their vision for the future professionally for me evolving from being an active day to day ceo of an operating business to making a meaningful contribution to a company as a private equity owner and investor is a transition i have been looking forward to for some time

6518352 eligibility to take time off to care for a sick friend under an equivalent of the family and medical leave act for example
6518353 if a person is incapacitated and has no functional familial relationships friends are not typically permitted to make medical decisions unless designated in advance hospitals often restrict visitors to kin or allow family members to vet visitors which can cause anguish when friends and families come into conflict
6518354 permitting people to register as designated friends with mutual benefits and obligations the friends would have the right and duty to make financial and medical decisions on each others behalf in case of incapacitation theyd have the same medical leave and testimonial privileges as spouses and if one died without a will the other would be entitled to a share of the estate

6518367 the government has unlawfully banned our peaceful programme with a dishonest motive the behaviour of police toward the 4 party alliance is step motherly and hostile
6518368 the government behaved with partisan attitude by obstructing our programme and the police stopped the peaceful programme of the 4 party alliance issuing a press notes

6518374 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6518375 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside
6518376 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded

6518380 the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player
6518381 in that regard the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is irrelevant

6518390 10 separate meetings with political parties and civil society groups including members of the central executive committee of the national league for democracy student representatives and elected individuals from the 1990 elections
6518391 how can gambari achieve anything when he allows the burmese regime to dictate his schedule and spends only 20 minutes with pro democracy groups
6518392 even in this rare 20 minute meeting gambari urged nld leaders to participate in a sham 2010 election that guarantees all key government ministries to the military the burmese democracy movement is losing its trust in him and the united nations
6518393 because gambari has kowtowed to the regime on his schedule he was even unable to meet aung san suu kyi because she had made a simple request that she meet with gambari and her political party members at the same time

6518410 one of japans top cell phone innovators says that for all his countrys technological prowess it could never have produced the iphone
6518411 japans telecommunications industry stifles the kind of creativity that is so apparent in apples web surfing phone says takeshi natsuno who developed japans first internet linking cell phone service
6518412 this is a great device he said affectionately touching a black iphone 3g during an interview thursday with the associated press
6518413 natsuno 43 who quit top japanese mobile carrier ntt docomo three months ago expressed disenchantment with this nations phone industry which he said was dominated by stodgy conservatives who lacked the charisma and creative sensibilities of a steve jobs chief executive at cupertino california based apple
6518414 the iphone introduced in japan last month has drawn long lines although it still makes up a tiny portion of japans 115 million cell phone market
6518415 im still not sure about the mp3 generation you can have a full hard drive and nothing to show for it record collections are very personal you can view into a persons soul really
6518416 i just couldnt understand why they decided to turn their backs on it i saw an opportunity to do something i love doing ive been a collector myself for years
6518417 its about the kind of acts that have very loyal fan bases that want everything to do with that act
6518418 they maybe will buy the download to listen to but they get the vinyl to own its looked at like artwork
6518419 labels have realised that its cool for bands to release their music on vinyl especially in limited edition form which makes it highly collectible
6518420 if you go into a record shop to buy something you feel part of something
6518421 the fact that last year we sold over 9 000 frames to people says an awful lot about where the market is going
6518422 ive really been getting back into my vinyl i love it
6518423 i like to hear crackling as if its actually real especially with drumnbass djs are really encouraging fans to buy vinyl

6518427 im beginning to wonder if the russian president is ever going to keep his word or can he keep his word or whats going on there
6518428 i wouldnt have left a finnish major who was a military observer there so of course we didnt know but you know as ive said theres no point in escalating the war of words in this the osce is an international organization which is serious about its military monitoring and tries to help everyone for a permanent cease fire
6518429 lets just put all the energy that we have into trying to maintain the cease fire get the humanitarian aid there get people back into their homes and start real peace negotiations
6518430 all of this rubbish screaming and shouting left and right does no good for anyone
6518431 this is a small project that probably a very few of you know about we are porting myst to the iphone ok before some of you start groaning this is an outside funded project that is keeping a few developers employed but it is really more than that it is an interesting and fun project this is also a very small team with three of us which includes derek rand not randy and myself

6518452 the fcc is directed by five commissioners appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate for 5 year terms except when filling an unexpired term the president designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairperson only three commissioners may be members of the same political party none of them can have a financial interest in any commission related business

6518457 these are the same people mr flaherty mr baird mr clement who are responsible for what happened in walkerton who privatized ontarios propane inspection and they want to do something equivalent about food inspections which is at the core of what the government should do
6518458 this very conservative government does not understand what is at the core of the responsibility of a government in a society
6518459 a government should work with the industry but ultimately the government is responsible for the regulations the safety of food
6518460 thats not to say that a small butcher cant make mistakes but at best hes going to kill off a few of his neighbours when you take that same mistake and you put it into a plant that serves millions the risk is vastly expanded
6518461 shift from full time cfia meat inspection presence to an oversight role allowing industry to implement food safety control programs and to manage key risks
6518462 the announcement of these reallocations has been deferred owing to significant communications risks and to allow for further policy and communications work to be completed

6518477 het grote probleem van de watervoetafdruk in belgi is dat 80 procent van ons watergebruik buiten belgi plaats vindt door de import van producten en goederen
6518478 veel producten zoals koffie katoen of meel worden zelfs gekweekt in de droogste gebieden ter wereld waar de waterreserves bijna of zeker onder druk staan
6518479 de meeste mensen zijn zich zelfs niet bewust van het feit dat het voedsel en de vezels die zij gebruiken grote hoeveelheden water nodig hebben en dit alles staat los van het water dat we gebruiken om te drinken om ons te wassen of om het gras te besproeien
6518480 this told us we had a problem with the program
6518481 we had high rates of fraud everywhere except the ivory coast

6518492 it was the right decision to sell the bank as quickly as possible
6518493 unlike previous periods in our history there is virtually no process for unskilled immigrants without family relations in the u s to apply for permanent legal residence
6518494 workers with family already here or college degrees face a convoluted cruel and uncertain process and they are the lucky ones for poor laborers who pick our crops and build our homes there is virtually no legal process and no line to wait in if they hope to permanently work and live in this country
6518495 our high tech companies are starving for qualified engineers and skilled workers
6518496 these are american companies trying to find the best workers so that they can compete globally instead our system handicaps american companies and denies them the skills and talents of thousands of potential workers it is economic suicide
6518497 the american civil liberties union commends reason magazine for graphically capturing how burdensome the federal government has made the citizenship process for people hoping to become americans
6518498 but this process not only affects those hoping for a chance to contribute to our society it has also created problems for innocent american citizens
6518499 there have been far too many stories of innocent americans being arrested and detained for hours and even deported on the suspicion of being here illegally
6518500 as reason makes clear we have got to go in a different direction and dramatically overhaul our immigration system it is illogical burdensome and long past time those in washington chose to address these issues in ways that will continue to allow our nation to grow and prosper
6518501 reason foundations flow chart graphically demonstrates how badly broken our system is it will help show the desperate need for a program to handle workers who wish to come to the us legally quite simply these people cannot wait in line because there is no line we hope this effort will help prod congress to create a workable program for non citizen workers
6518502 the flowchart published by the reason foundation clearly demonstrates that the current u s visa and immigration system is broken the golden door foundation shares the belief that without a functioning legal work visa process the illegal immigrant population will continue to grow an aging population exiting the workforce and companies moving operations outside the u s are issues that need to be addressed to deal effectively with the immigration crisis and current labor shortages facing the united states the golden door foundation applauds the work of the reason foundation to show that there is a need to fix the overly bureaucratic and unfair visa program

6518505 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
6518506 this should not be surprising since most solar pv companies that have reported 2q results have also beaten and raised cy08 expectations
6518507 the biggest difference is in projected supply growth with stp expecting industry supply to grow at the same rate as demand growth or 25 to 30 while stp is increasing its own capacity by 40 in cy09 and while we are modeling for supply to grow 50 plus in cy09 yes big delta
6518508 this is a very strong revenue and eps result on strong shipments asps and gm
6518509 stp is fully booked for 2h08 and now have 200mw signed for 2009 at fixed pricing and expects by end of q3 will have 500mw additional signed at fixed pricing this is the most bullish commentary in the release in our view this would equate to 70 of our 09 production estimate

6518514 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6518515 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6518516 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6518517 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6518518 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6518519 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6518520 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6518521 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6518522 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6518523 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6518524 all campaigns have to have a clear strategy theme and message and this is a pretty strong one i think theyll keep hammering at it

6518544 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6518545 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6518546 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6518547 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6518548 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6518549 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6518550 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope

6518630 its more about divvying up fault and the economic resource to generally get the person the hospital care they need there is not a big windfall that anybody is going to get because they were in an accident
6518631 so there is no incentive for lawyers to ask for them
6518632 there is really no non monetary damages that are ever awarded so the kind of ridiculous results you see where a lawyer convinces a jury to make the company feel it by taking 10 percent of their market cap is not going to happen in nebraska

6518639 points wise it was a very good weekend ive been on the podium in my last four races now and just hope that i can maintain that level of consistency in the remaining rounds

6518641 i picked a driver off lap by lap until i caught the leader jake dennis i passed him and was able to open a gap of three kart lengths which i held to the finish
6518642 jake won it with a cheeky move there was a bit of contact which dropped me to 6th but i clawed my way back up to 3rd and was relieved to see the two guys closest to me in the championship standings mackenzie taylor and alexander albon were behind me and dropping points as a result
6518643 it was mayhem so it was there were lots of people crashing and bashing
6518644 considering that i started the first final in 25th and ended up inside the top ten isnt too bad the championship is really close now and im aiming for a top three position id be over the moon if i could do that ill keep banging on the door until i get a lucky break

6518651 overall these are a very satisfactory set of results in the face of declining earnings for our sydney and melbourne metropolitan newspapers in australia and tough trading conditions particularly in new zealand

6518671 with summer gas prices reaching an all time high the last thing long island drivers need are gas stations hitting them with exorbitant prices for paying with a credit card
6518672 our investigation revealed that long island is a hotbed for gas stations that engage in deceptive practices where they display one price as a way to lure customers and then charge them more at the pump
6518673 todays gas prices dictate that fewer and fewer consumers have enough cash on hand to pay the cash only price to fill up their tanks
6518674 therefore it is inexcusable that business owners would use the lure of lower prices to entice customers and then rip them off these stations are breaking the law and they must immediately stop these deceptive practices or they will be subject to further action by my office

6518680 were he just now to slam the door on the forum and walk away thats a pretty powerful message the european union is going to hear
6518681 i dont think in the long term fiji has much to lose if its not a member of the forum i myself had reservations about the usefulness of the forum

6518687 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6518688 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6518689 it had become the culture in his neighborhood to visit igor to get your bike
6518690 it was gods way of saying its time to put a stop to this
6518691 he made a lot of money off it judging by where he was living

6518698 im well aware myself what i can do and where i should be
6518699 i try not to listen too much to what everybody has to say im only 27 years old and ive got plenty time ahead of me hopefully thats the first step back to keeping myself in there
6518700 you want to be involved but i wasnt stupid i knew from where my career was that i wasnt going to be involved
6518701 paul hartley was 28 or 29 when he broke on to the international scene and hes done tremendously well thats maybe something i can emulate in the next few years
6518702 time will tell if im involved and thats the managers decision
6518703 we will have to see how it develops but i would love to be involved i am available thats how it is and thats how its been for a while i enjoy playing for my country but i understand how it is and have to be realistic i know im not going to be here forever i want to play as long as i can and enjoy it as long as i can if the manager makes a decision then i understand it
6518704 theres a spark the crowds got an extra spark and the atmospheres that much better it means more no matter how you dress it up
6518705 i still believe the fundamentals of our economy are strong weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment or so many of the other health care
6518706 can i point out that your idea of radical left is centre right in europe
6518707 take into account that almost every other major economy is growing faster
6518708 well be lucky if we avoid several years of 1970s style stagflation
6518709 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
6518710 mccain pledges to balance the budget by 2012 not by increasing taxes but by vetoing all pork barrel spending and curbing outlays for social security and medicare
6518711 mccains overall goal is to balance the budget by the end of his second term says economic adviser douglas holtz eakin that would be 2017
6518712 said that if the war and the personal and corporate tax cuts that mr mccain advocated added to the federal deficit and debt so be it i would like the next president not to talk about deficit reduction he said
6518713 that plan when appropriately phased in as it has always been intended to be will bring the budget to balance by the end of his first term
6518714 but were not going to have a balanced budget before you leave office in your first term
6518715 well that still should be a goal but the goal the goal right now is to get the economy going again
6518716 you have to pay for that somehow or you are george bush iii
6518717 how do the democrats propose to balance a budget when their platform clearly outlines massive increases in the federal budget
6518718 inflation is rising real wages are declining unemployment is increasing cost of food is rising optimism about economy is declining foreclosures are still increasing
6518719 fundamentalist have strong hunkering down instincts despite all signs they are wrong in their world view perspectives
6518720 6 minutes ago 0 0 obviously the economy hasnt collapsed yet obviously its resilient enough to withstand what its taken thus far but how long does that resilience last
6518721 the american economy has been getting pummeled by the one two punch of soaring oil prices and the collapse of the housing bubble but a stubbornly resilient economy has failed to produce the two quarters of declining output that have become the focus of the medias recession watch
6518722 if the economy is not treating you well just sell one of your houses
6518723 eight years of conservative management have left the economy with something other than

6518743 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation

6518761 because our industry has become an exciting career target for people who want to learn stick it out and learn some more but its not as easy anymore
6518762 its become sophisticated and super organized we call it a relationship business and it may take only five years for an educated novice to build a fair income but ten years of applying oneself to make it really worthwhile
6518763 the difference today is huge and fascinating in the early 90s there were few rules and a big appetite for risk minimal pre leasing is just one example of how and wherever developers broke ground back then land would stay vacant for awhile and lenders would take action before long this is not happening now theres too much discipline and worked over market analysis consultants and advisors know that dundas and hurontario has no 30 floor office tower simply because that market isnt ready yet
6518764 fresh up from handling the savings amp loan fiasco in the u s these professionals with help from canadian partners were astute enough to quantify the problems take on the debt loads harness whats left of their revenue machine and turn them around they recognized the problems and just dealt with them meanwhile helping our industry clean up a good amount of the financial mess we had gotten ourselves into
6518765 but this all didnt happen by chance residential brokerage had gone awry with desk renting when equal partnerships were formed between companies and part time brokers commercial realtors had to split away and many of the companies went public bringing on governance and new standards of scrutiny development has been virtually institutionalized with new procedures forcing borrowers to pre lease and show evidence of soundness so the result is that the industry has become very good at matching supply with demand
6518766 right now we have 300 000 square feet under development which last year at this time was 800 000
6518767 but thats stability a healthy balance of supply and demand real estate markets have the ability to right size their economy when vacancies drop and rates increase followed by increased building activity
6518768 now in the 21st century office and industrial developers who say theyre building 200 000 square feet on spec are not really theyve done their research with market analysis and feedback and so have the banks and mortgagors whove given them a market threshold for the right time to dig
6518769 id put lease rates at about priority 7 when it comes to primary needs from the industrial sector
6518770 and in some cases the employment base is priority 1
6518771 massive infrastructure spending from the federal and provincial governments certainly is helping to shore up the local economy in a sustainable way and toronto has great examples of coordinated development in liberty village the distillery district and now eastern avenue but you always have a large problem with rezoning when probing whats available in toronto
6518772 were giving primary focus to brampton burlington caledon milton and oakville for significant growth but not to forget higher density development along mississaugas main arteries
6518773 mississauga is targeted for infill housing and redevelopment of older retail and industrial properties land rates in the city are high but rental rates offer quite good value for tenants commercial and industrial growth in the city is pretty much a sure thing providing a few temporary economic woes can be worked through
6518774 i dont think it affects us much here in ontario
6518775 i would think most of the good tradespeople are working right now in this province
6518776 i know the big push is in alberta and b c
6518777 it has become somewhat of a non issue here because the unions have been able to supply the trades in ontario and if they cant get them they go to the nearest local thats the way it has always been in construction any time there has been a tightening up of supply weve been able to work through it
6518778 trades in ottawa and quebec go across that bridge all the time and they share a trade association office in hull
6518779 theres nothing to stop them theres only a bridge to cross and the last time i looked there wasnt a barrier there
6518780 for the most part our industry is already based on being mobile and being able to go where the work is
6518781 tradespeople across canada have faced archaic and inconsistent rules when seeking work in another province for too long
6518782 with the ongoing acute shortages of skilled tradespeople canadas construction industry can no longer afford the luxury of provincial protectionism
6518783 for the most part were not opposed to mobility as long as we maintain standards
6518784 but for example b c has lowered standards as far as construction trades
6518785 i think it will make it a little easier for guys to move if youre trained in one province you should be good across canada
6518786 the problem is when you get there the cost of living is so high youre better to stay here
6518787 once you register in one zone you cant work in another
6518788 im reading all this b s that theres going to be an exodus the nbas not going to lose any great players
6518789 first of all i think kobe and lebron have too much time on their hands
6518790 these guys want to be the best players in the world
6518791 what results is a sequence of contradictions gaps and omissions of stunning gravity
6518792 when the united states first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaeda and weapons of mass destruction
6518793 i had a really sick feeling to my stomach when i heard about these things that went on
6518794 i knew that my conscience couldnt allow me to go over there to iraq
6518795 he feels more strongly now than ever that he is right
6518796 and he is willing to accept the consequences whatever they might be
6518797 i have a son i wouldnt be able to see its kind of hard to think about that
6518798 canada is supposedly not participating in the war against iraq
6518799 yet by sending soldiers back they are supporting the war
6518800 the deportation of robin long is a gift from harper to the bush administration
6518801 none of us should have to go to jail for standing up for what we believe in and refusing to fight in an immoral war
6518802 he is the first one of us to be deported to the united states and that has a lot of significance up here in canada
6518803 veterans and war resisters are beginning to see that they are in the same boat that they are brothers and sisters and it is one struggle
6518804 the fact that people are showing this kind of solidarity with each other is really profound resistance within the military is certainly growing

6518815 graduates of yale university i apologize if you have endured this type of prologue before but i want you to do something for me
6518816 in fact as i look out before me today i dont see a thousand hopes for a bright tomorrow i dont see a thousand future leaders in a thousand industries i see a thousand losers
6518817 because bill gates richest man on the planet for now anyway is a college dropout and you are not
6518818 because paul allen the third richest man on the planet dropped out of college and you did not
6518819 and for good measure because michael dell no 9 on the list and moving up fast is a college dropout and you yet again are not
6518820 you will need them because you didnt drop out and so you will never be among the richest people in the world
6518821 instead i want to give hope to any underclassmen here today
6518822 ill bet you a round of drinks that my dog can talk

6518824 seniors are part of a generation that had to do without and overcome adversity so they may be less inclined to complain
6518825 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6518826 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps that we are taking today never before in our history as a province have we been prepared to take these important steps toward self reliance
6518827 around 2016 what well have essentially is an artificial island 350 km or so offshore and certainly that will need to be supported
6518828 so what well have is about a range of a thousand people employed directly on the project then another couple thousand in terms of indirect jobs onshore supporting the whole enterprise
6518829 there will be no more giveaways in this province we are not going to do a bad deal

6518852 somehow the smoke eaters sniffed out the pot in a three story building next door and called the cops
6518853 this kind of testing has many applications but certainly political polling at election time would be one it cant give answers to all questions but it could certainly help pollsters to get more information than people now share
6518854 as it is quite reasonable to assume that such snap judgments are influenced by automatic associations
6518855 will focus on its domestic business this year due to concerns about snowballing u s credit problems
6518856 just as the equity market looked cheap to anybody who could source capital from the debt markets between 2003 and 2007 now it looks cheap to anybody who can source capital from the oil market and just as markets missed the point about private equity they could afford to pay higher prices for assets given their access to cheap debt capital maybe they are now missing the point about oil rich investors most financial assets look cheap when your source of capital is oil at over 100 a barrel
6518857 the re rating of global equities against oil over the past year has been just as significant as the re rating of debt against equity that kicked off the de equitisation trade a combination of rising oil and falling share prices means that a barrel of oil will now buy enough equities to deliver 8 of corporate earnings per year we divide the oil price by the market pe to calculate this way up from the 5 that it would have bought a year ago
6518858 what is happening now is every bit as weird as what happened in the bubble
6518859 despite googles reputation for fostering new companies many services that nestle into mountain views welcoming bosom are never heard from again
6518860 is every day either a good day for commodities and commodity stocks and a rotten day for financials and value stocks or an awful day for commodities and commodity stocks and a good day for financials and value stocks
6518861 there would be bidders if it was only the corporate bank
6518862 no one wanted to get into these kinds of securities now
6518863 the incentive to get rid of assets should be there in general
6518864 what is happening now is the catalyst we were waiting for
6518865 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6518866 i wish i could see you do that little cheerleader move could be kissing that perfect stomach of yours
6518867 while my past actions were unfortunate and for which i have expressed to my family my sincere apology one blogger has alleged that official rules or laws were broken that simply is not true
6518868 its sad that my political opponents have chosen to resort to the lowest tactics by dredging up a private matter from years ago just 21 days before an election
6518869 i have a lot of problems with the way this loan was written
6518870 i can do better if i kick it the whole way
6518871 we are really trying to create this generation of hiv negative kids
6518872 we give them all the information so they can possibly lead a healthy lifestyle its getting kids to talk about these problems and reducing the stigma of hiv and aids we want everyone in america to know about grassroot soccer
6518873 it transcends boundaries it breaks down cultural stereotypes it brings people together
6518874 soccer certainly absorbed a lot of his time and a lot of his emotion
6518875 soccer has been very important to us and has helped us a lot
6518876 that was my first real experience knowing and then having someone die of aids
6518877 here i am in the middle of this game and i had a real life experience which i didnt expect to happen
6518878 that got my mind spinning if things go my way i want to do something good with my money and 15 minutes of fame
6518879 in africa soccer players are heroes they are like role models the gods of the community
6518880 we train local professional soccer players about hiv and aids and they go into the schools and teach the youths about aids prevention
6518881 he has a huge heart and he cares about everyone
6518882 he knows hes supposed to help people and he does he makes his dreams happen to benefit someone other than himself
6518883 thats how i use the celebrity and flip it back on itself
6518884 and turn it into something positive for grassroot soccer and for myself
6518885 everybody has interpreted the shrinking population of working age people as a mass exodus by young people out of vermont but thats really a very small part of the story
6518886 the biggest part of the story is that people just arent being born
6518887 this low birthrate is a component of a much bigger problem
6518888 employers cite adequacy of the work force as one major concern for future success here
6518889 we have employers who have created good jobs and want to create more but they need a qualified work force to take those jobs
6518890 given the state of the evidence i dont feel its just to hold the defendant in custody
6518891 these events constitute a change in circumstances with regard to the defendants bail
6518892 are you telling me that youre representing to the court that you no longer believe there was a kidnapping which is a capital offense that carries life imprisonment and you want to keep that hanging over this defendants head
6518893 as the stories have already changed once i dont know if theyre going to change again
6518894 so you want to keep the cases pending but you dont believe the witnesses
6518895 youre moving forward on a case but you dont have a good faith basis
6518896 its been a fluid situation over the past 24 to 48 hours with the client and unfortunately hes caught in the middle right now
6518897 all parties including the district attorneys office would expect him to be released in the near future
6518898 i knew he wasnt capable of doing anything like they were saying
6518899 my first thought was that this must have been a setup hes a good kid hes a hard worker i just couldnt believe it i knew something was wrong
6518900 the suspect then grabbed victim 1 and took her into her bedroom down the hall and climbed on top of her on her bed
6518901 she told him to stop and kept saying no but he proceeded to have intercourse with her and wouldnt get off of her she then said he eventually got off of her and went back into the living room where he then assaulted victim 2 again
6518902 the suspect grabbed hold of her and bit her on the neck
6518903 he then started dragging her into the woods as she attempted to fight him off victim 2 said she was scared she was going to get raped again
6518904 advancing this work through the open standards process offers tangible benefits for device and platform vendors developers and consumers alike
6518905 these standards will enable the development of a new generation of enterprise enabled resources which can be automatically discovered and then function seamlessly together
6518906 this work will make it possible for a wide variety of devices to find each other and interoperate using web services techniques
6518907 the project will leverage existing basic web services methods to expand the scope of soa networks to a much broader range of machines and endpoints
6518908 ws dd is complementary to standards such as uddi and it will help improve the scale and flexibility of applications through the improved dynamic discovery of devices such as smart phones and services that may not be connected ca will continue to work closely with other industry leaders to enable a new generation of management security and governance solutions that support these more dynamic flexible applications
6518909 the formation of the ws dd technical committee is an important milestone and builds upon mature ws base protocols by expanding the scope to include the wide variety of devices being used today in homes and enterprises defining protocols for discovering securely consuming and exposing web services in a lightweight footprint that suits these devices has the potential to greatly broaden the reach of web services to meet customers needs discovery of enterprise resources whether devices or web services can help make large scale soa implementations more robust and simpler to manage
6518910 red hat is pleased to be involved with ws dd as we believe this is an important missing piece of the ws standardization effort particularly as it applies to the ongoing move towards more autonomous and large scale infrastructures that we are seeing being developed
6518911 a lightweight protocol for locating and identifying web services instances dynamically within an ad hoc environment should prove invaluable for enterprise level monitoring of soa landscapes by building upon the ws discovery specification we can address such requirements in a pragmatic and interoperable manner as the co author of the original specification were delighted to take a leadership role in advancing this standard further through the formation and work of the new technical committee in oasis

6518956 there is a long lasting debate about the sociocultural state of icemans society
6518957 one fraction says he belongs to the gatherer hunter society which is more primitive than the more progressive pastoral agricultural society which followed after
6518958 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6518959 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
6518960 that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife cindy own
6518961 now this puzzled me i was confused what he meant but then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and they said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong but if you are like me and youve got one house or if you are like the millions of people struggling now to keep up with your mortgage payments you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes

6518967 as we were flying over the desert we landed in the middle of nowhere
6518968 theres no doubt that americans possess the resources and passion to close off our borders and ports from illegal immigration and contraband

6518974 to manage talent successfully executives must recognize that their talent strategies cannot focus solely on the top performers that different things make people of different genders ages and nationalities want to work for and remain at a company and that hr requires additional capabilities and encouragement to develop effective solutions only in this way will talent management establish itself at the heart of business strategy
6518975 hr professionals say that these workers demand more flexibility meaningful jobs professional freedom higher rewards and a better work life balance than older employees do people in this group see their professional careers as a series of two to three year chapters and will readily switch jobs so companies face the risk of high attrition if their expectations arent met the gen y cohort already representing 12 percent of the us workforce is therefore perceived as substantially harder to manage than its predecessors
6518976 finally knowledge workers the fastest growing talent pool in most organizations have their own demands and peculiarities by one estimate 48 million of the 137 million workers in the united states alone can be classified in this group knowledge workers are different because they create more profit than other employees do up to three times more yet the performance of knowledge intensive companies within the same industry varies significantly which suggests that some of them struggle to extract value from this newly enlarged type of workforce
6518977 when companies do make talent a priority they often fall into another trap focusing narrowly on hr systems and processes which divert attention from the place where most of the obstacles lie peoples heads
6518978 habits of mind are the real barriers to talent management

6519022 a bad habit becomes destructive when your behavior causes more than momentary regret and leaves you feeling disappointed in yourself
6519023 procrastinators tend to be very concerned about what other people think of them

6519047 ive got to say im a little offended this is nothing to make light of

6519130 r ather than acting to restrict arms exports the guidelines against which arms export licence applications are assessed are vague and interpreted in such a way as to facilitate exports

6519278 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6519286 in the first half we werent knocking down shots but we were playing great defense and that was what allowed us to stay in the game
6519287 coach said that defense was the difference between today and two years ago
6519288 two years ago we had the same thing where we couldnt score but then we couldnt keep them from scoring but this year we found a way to play as a unit and get those stops
6519289 we always talk about offensively we are going to find a way to score enough points to win

6519355 a statement by solicitor general devanedera said that the government will review the terms of the moa or will renegotiate its terms is not tantamount to a commitment that they will not sign the same
6519356 the results of the intended review or renegotiation of the moa include among its distinct possibilities a decision to adopt the exact or equivalent moa in contention thus leaving very much alive ripe and intact for adjudication the claims and prayers of the petitions as well as the petitions in intervention
6519357 it is clear that the government is now attempting to render moot the issues raised by the petitioners and intervenors by a weakly undertaking to conduct a review of the moa

6519402 in todays market where home prices are dropping its more important than ever for sellers to maximize their sales price
6519403 its clear from this consumer reports research that sellers are better off using a for sale by owner method to sell their homes not only will they get their asking price theyll also avoid paying an expensive commission fee that would only lower the amount they actually receive for their home for a 300 000 home the 5 000 price differential and the commission paid to the agent represent a loss to a home seller of more than 20 000

6519487 scientific consensus is that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prominently including carbon dioxide and methane emitted by fossil fuels combustion will cause global climate to change in the next several decades if such changes have not already occurred

6519490 two bounding heat transfer modeling techniques were considered the first envisioned a solid ball of frozen hydrazine in the center of the tank with a vacuum following depressurization of the tank at the time of vehicle breakup between it and the tank inner wall in such a case the principal subsequent heat transfer mode into the hydrazine would be via radiation alternatively the hydrazine could be envisioned as a uniform shell i e material layer affixed to the complete inner wall of the tank with a dead space in the center this internal layer of hydrazine would have a thickness of 0 197 meters both cases were analyzed
6519491 it is extremely likely that the hydrazine in contact with the titanium wall will melt away in layers
6519492 most if not all time lapse images showed no sign of flaring flashing or indeed a tumbling spacecraft
6519493 the initial temperature of the tank and the hydrazine was dictated underlining mine to be 214 kelvin for this study although the actual temperature would very likely be higher

6519516 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6519517 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6519518 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6519519 we know that the planes supplying what we call close air support could not engage because the french troops were very close to the taliban insurgents
6519520 if they had engaged there might have been considerable collateral damage if bombs had been used
6519521 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6519522 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes

6519526 ive had many political candidates come through but ive never had any work along with us in the area of social action changes
6519527 most candidates who are running for national office have more programs just getting people out voting for them but to give back to the community is a heavy statement for social change
6519528 there was such a sense for us that the place to make a difference in the world was very direct the entrepreneurial spirit was in the nonprofit sector
6519529 politics was either going to be part of the problem or part of the solution but it was no longer something we could ignore in the solace of the nonprofit sector
6519530 the struggle in our country right now is a struggle to replace the culture of corruption with a culture of service to country and community
6519531 the tithing project is not just about ensuring that the least among us still has a voice in the political process its also about making sure we are part of a transformation in the country to restore a culture of service

6519546 i think one of the things that is important especially for john mccain as unique a politician as he is is to demonstrate the diversity and differences of ideology i would say of our party

6519620 i have no problems with his showboating before the race but a shake of the hand or a tap on the shoulder immediately after the race would be a good gesture

6519628 unfortunately the barrier that was planned and approved by the government of israel does not satisfy the security needs the daily needs of the palestinians and israels security needs clash throughout the entire region we cannot ignore the fact that the current route turns abu dis and al azaria into a surrounded enclave that is detached from east jerusalem and the northern west bank

6519741 a responsabiliza o penal da pessoa jur dica pela pr tica de delitos ambientais surge assim como forma n o apenas de puni o das condutas lesivas ao meio ambiente mas como forma mesmo de preven o da pr tica de tais crimes fun o essencial da pol tica ambiental que clama por preserva o

6519743 a maioria dos pa ses da europa pune a pessoa f sica e jur dica que lesa o meio ambiente n o s administrativa e civil mas tamb m penalmente nas esferas administrativa e civil a prote o ao meio ambiente n o tem sido eficaz na esfera administrativa das multas aplicadas pelo ibama em 1997 somente seis por cento foram recolhidas aos cofres p blicos e na esfera civil nem todas as a es civis p blicas t m sido coroadas de xito especialmente pela demora no seu tr mite por isso a necessidade da tutela penal tendo se em vista seu efeito intimidativo e educativo e n o s repressivo trata se de uma preven o geral e especial ressalte se que alguns pa ses inseriram tipos penais ambientais no c digo penal e outros por legisla o ordin ria nos dias presentes a tend ncia no mundo moderno responsabilizar penalmente a pessoa f sica e jur dica que cometa crimes contra o meio ambiente
6519744 por outro lado a san o de natureza penal oferece um contra est mulo muito mais eficiente na prote o do meio ambiente justamente por trabalhar em harmonia com a l gica do mercado capitalista a pena criminal possui efeito estigmatizante que para a pessoa f sica sempre foi considerado um ponto negativo a pessoa f sica tem maiores dificuldades para a reinser o social ap s receber a marca o oficial de criminoso no caso da pessoa jur dica a marca da responsabilidade criminal dificulta os neg cios da pessoa jur dica e na defesa de seus interesses econ micos os dirigentes da pessoa jur dica s o estimulados a evitar o processo penal na l gica do mercado a certifica o de qualidade ambiental do iso 14 001 abre caminho para bons neg cios j a den ncia criminal possui efeito contr rio descredencia e em alguns casos inviabiliza a transa o comercial com a pessoa jur dica respons vel por dano ambiental o tempo se encarregar de mostrar que a op o pela responsabiliza o criminal da pessoa jur dica desenvolve estrat gia muito eficiente na preserva o do meio ambiente em especial porque trabalha intervindo na l gica capitalista do lucro

6519746 a responsabiliza o penal da pessoa jur dica sendo decorrente de uma op o eminentemente pol tica conforme referido depende logicamente de uma modifica o da dogm tica penal cl ssica para sua implementa o e aplica o
6519747 a responsabilidade penal desta evid ncia n o poder ser entendida na forma tradicional baseada na culpa na responsabilidade individual subjetiva propugnados pela escola cl ssica mas deve ser entendida luz de uma nova responsabilidade classificada como social
6519748 pessoa jur dica pode se imputar exigir e atribuir a responsabilidade penal

6519751 disso decorre que a pessoa jur dica repita se s pode ser responsabilizada quando houver interven o de uma pessoa f sica que atua em nome e em benef cio do ente moral

6519760 whilst the deadline has passed for miners to lodge claims there are still many claims awaiting settlement some of which may take up to two years before a successful conclusion is reached therefore the site is still critical for solicitors to continue to track the progress of any outstanding claims it is now updated by capita who administer the services for berr providing information such as requests for more health information for each miner progress on claims and the details of the claims settlements
6519761 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget

6519763 mexican public opinion and all the various political factions that aspired to or that actually shared in power at that time had to willingly or unwillingly participate in a very hawkish attitude toward the war anyone who tried to avoid open conflict with the united states was treated as a traitor that was precisely the case of president jos joaquin de herrera at one time he at least seriously considered receiving the american special envoy john slidell in order to negotiate the problem of texas annexation peacefully but as soon as he assumed that position the president was accused of favoring the handing over of a part of national territory he was accused of treason and was overthrown
6519764 the mexican war made the officers of the old regular armies more or less acquainted and when we knew the name of the general opposing we knew enough about him to make our plans accordingly what determined my attack on fort donelson was as much the knowledge i had gained of its commanders in mexico as anything else

6519797 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6519798 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6519799 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6519800 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6519801 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6519802 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6519803 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6519818 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6519819 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6519820 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional

6519822 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6519825 in daily life couples can be so busy with work and social commitments that they spend little time together
6519826 but sometimes all day every day for a couple of weeks is too much if you are used to having time apart in your daily lives allow for this when you are on holiday
6519827 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6519828 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6519829 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6519830 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6519831 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6519832 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6519833 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation

6519837 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6519838 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

6519841 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6519842 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6519843 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6519844 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6519845 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6519846 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6519847 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6519848 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6519849 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6519850 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

6519852 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6519853 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6519854 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6519855 but if you are just in a generic store it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6519856 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6519857 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6519858 the mechanism we present should be able to provide a variety of possible properties which will definitely encompass the ones we observe in our galaxy
6519859 as satisfying as the new results are the case for as the origin for the disk stars remains unproven
6519860 we do not know whether the initial conditions assumed by bonnell and rice are realized in the
6519861 what we need to do next is to worry about the likelihood of these other events happening
6519862 for the process weve outlined the probability is high enough that it has a real chance of happening i dont think its anything that will prove to be that controversial in the long run i have a feeling it seems quite likely
6519863 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6519864 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6519865 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6519866 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6519867 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6519868 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6519869 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6519870 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6519871 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6519872 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6519873 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6519874 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6519875 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6519876 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6519877 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6519878 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6519879 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6519880 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6519881 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6519882 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6519883 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6519884 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6519885 things should be made as simple as possible but no simpler
6519886 a guy came into the hospital and said you dont know me but i was one of those people you hauled out of the x ray
6519887 he joined the navy and hated it the ocean thing was not his bag
6519888 he was tenacious about getting into flight school he drove them insane until they let him in
6519889 he was a super instructor he was not one of these guys who get excited very easily
6519890 anyone who flew for the government had to get past him
6519891 were a bunch of loose cannons we have our own opinions but everything is in jest
6519892 if he thought he was right he didnt care if he told a general he was wrong he was a mans man
6519893 he was a caring guy who cared about his family
6519894 activists have been engaged in the greening of post boxes across the north in the previous week to assert proudly and very visibly that we live in ireland and our post boxes should be green
6519895 this is a practical manifestation of the all ireland agenda a novel way in which young nationally minded people can promote their irishness and highlight the folly of partition the young people involved in these actions are simply providing a public service and should be applauded for saving an post a job of work when we achieve irish unity
6519896 strom thurmond who as a senator would later join the republican party
6519897 we want to punish the democrats we want to hurt them wound them

6519900 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
6519901 i think its a good idea if it can help out the umpires
6519902 some of these stadiums especially the new ones are so difficult to tell if a ball is a home run or not i was in detroit standing in right center field during early bp someone hit a ball that looked like it went over the fence i said thats a home run then someone told me no it isnt it hit the wall first these umpires have to make that call from 100 feet away at least i couldnt tell i got it wrong and i was 10 feet away
6519903 i dont know if its a good thing but its the right thing to do
6519904 when something can determine the outcome of a game you have to get it right
6519905 this is good for baseball were not going to lose an important game in september or an important game in october because someone missed a home run call our players like the idea everyone likes the idea were just trying to give nearsighted umpires some glasses
6519906 the umpires are in favor of it not because weve made a lot of mistakes but because we cant see the calls we cant see the plays there was a time when there were two yellow poles and a green wall if the ball didnt bounce back on the field it was a home run if it did it wasnt a home run now we have flowers on the outfield fence in philadelphia we have foul poles that are set a few feet back from the fence we have backsplash on outfield walls and the monster seats in boston its so much more difficult now we cant see the calls
6519907 when were done we still might not have all the answers its a work in progress
6519908 we just want to make sure were all speaking the same language
6519909 i dont need to be carrying a red flag in my pants
6519910 if they can run back and check it in five minutes thats less time that a normal argument would take cubs manager lou piniella takes a lot longer than that when hes kicking and screaming
6519911 the concern is that youre opening the door with replay
6519912 you dont want to have replay on out safe calls tag calls trapped balls you have to keep the human element
6519913 tired of spending way too many friday nights in my
6519914 you have to be one of the hardest to find fault in you have a selfless and caring nature youre a good listener and someone who wants to avoid conflict you genuinely desire to do good
6519915 how can i work with my team to ensure technology supports the vision
6519916 when knowledge gained somewhere doesnt move elsewhere thats not a learning organization thats just a bunch of projects
6519917 if you think youre voting for john mccain who ran for president against george bush in 2000 youre wrong
6519918 apparently im a flip flopper whos too stubborn to change his mind
6519919 he cant win by attacking my real positions and my real record so he invents one
6519920 until a few years ago michelle and i made we just paid our student loans so we know what its like to work in this economy and we know what the american people need
6519921 in the past republicans and their operatives have used these kind of smears these attempts to frighten the american people in lieu of real ideas and serious solutions
6519922 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse
6519923 confessed criminals confessed rapists and confessed child abusers and confessed murderers
6519924 there was a recognition in the primaries that we spent a little too much time doing the big rallies
6519925 people think obamas fame or the fact they know him from a speech or a book is his totality and its not
6519926 cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
6519927 theres still a mystery element to this guy and the opposition so far has done a good job of defining him
6519928 the partys candidates tend to have an intellectual way of expressing their views
6519929 that gets portrayed as effete and elitist people like simplicity
6519930 theres a little bit of kerry in obama in that he seems aloof and not as engaged as mccain
6519931 you cant come out and say im uncomfortable with a black man as president but its entirely possible that theres a segment of the population that feels that way
6519932 is code for the n word if hes a white guy no ones saying hes elitist hes doing what everybody else is doing
6519933 hes just not my kind of candidate certainly some of it is inexperience but some is attitude
6519934 i get a pompous vibe from him and i dont like that
6519935 i dont know that he can it may be part and parcel of him
6519936 obama needs to offer as many specifics as possible talk about home foreclosures for instance or health care
6519937 one of our biggest battle tools is that barack obama and john mccain have completely different approaches to energy the economy foreign policy
6519938 obama needs to show how hes something different and mccain is more of the same
6519939 i want new ideas i want to hear about a new way of doing business
6519940 test a mans moral qualities as much as his physical resources and skills
6519941 the best guys typically have a hard time with pressure pressure helps michael phelps in swimming but in our sport pressure in shooting is a disaster
6519942 we dont fear anything especially our horses it is the complexity of the our sport that makes it difficult but i dont fear the horses thats for sure
6519943 the dna doesnt match it appears as though that bear wasnt involved in the petra davis attack
6519944 its just preliminary but im pretty confident of the results
6519945 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6519946 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6519947 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6519948 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6519949 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6519950 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6519951 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6519952 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6519953 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6519954 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6519955 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6519956 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6519957 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6519958 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6519959 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6519960 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6519961 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6519962 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6519963 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6519964 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6519965 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6519966 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6519967 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6519968 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6519969 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6519970 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6519971 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6519972 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6519973 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6519974 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6519975 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6519976 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6519977 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6519978 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6519979 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6519980 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6519981 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6519982 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6519983 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6519984 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6519985 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6519986 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6519987 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
