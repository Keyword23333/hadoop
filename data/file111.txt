1110138 according to this truth and this word of god we believe in one only god who is one single essence in which are three persons really truly and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties namely the father the son and the holy spirit the father is the cause origin and beginning of all things visible and invisible the son is the word the wisdom and the image of the father the holy spirit is the eternal power and might who proceeds from the father and the son nevertheless god is not by this distinction divided into three since the holy scriptures teach us that the father the son and the holy spirit each has his personal existence distinguished by their properties but in such a way that these three persons are but one only god it is therefore evident that the father is not the son nor the son the father and likewise the holy spirit is neither the father nor the son nevertheless these persons thus distinguished are not divided nor intermixed for the father has not assumed our flesh and blood neither has the holy spirit but the son only the father has never been without his son or without his holy spirit for they are all three co eternal and co essential there is neither first nor last for they are all three one in truth in power in goodness and in mercy

1110260 dat gebeurt soms op het veld maar voor mij is de kous nu af
1110261 the big hiv donors are creating aids specific systems that compete for health workers and administrative talent share the same inadequate infrastructure and further complicate already complex flows of information
1110262 while each donors approach is unique all three donors have helped establish aids specific systems and processes at the operational level that are distinct from those used for other health programs
1110263 the challenge now is how to integrate these aids activities into the broader public heath work in a way that will strengthen both
1110264 there is a lot of duplication of effort that could be avoided with better coordination
1110265 for example reports to aids donors and reports for the health ministries are often completed separately by the same health facility staff this extra effort takes away time from helping aids patients or providing other health services

1110375 in de eerste plaats een heel zachtaardige vrouw een prachtmens met heel veel kanten ze acteerde buitengewoon indringend kon lieve rollen heel erg goed spelen omdat die haar op het lijf geschreven waren in haar vriendenkring wordt zij herinnerd als een stralende vriendin die heel erg trouw was en we zullen haar humor missen ze laat een hele erge leegte achter
1110376 ik liep weg van school als er van die vreselijke vakken als wiskunde en mechanica werden gegeven nou dan konden ze me weer uit de studio halen die gelukkig twee straten verwijderd was van mijn school dus voor mij is het altijd al radio geweest
1110377 ik ben na ongeveer 10 maanden teruggegaan naar suriname toen ik daar zat dacht ik bij mezelf wat ben je toch een lummel dit kan je niet maken daarom ben ik met een heel andere instelling naar nederland teruggekeerd maar het bleef moeilijk want in totaal ben ik elf keer definitief naar suriname teruggegaan en ook even zoveel keer definitief naar nederland teruggekomen pas in 1977 heb ik besloten nu ga ik naar nederland en blijf ik daar ik wilde niet meer in een mandje boven de oceaan wonen daar had ik geen zin meer in
1110378 ik heb hier de moderne dingen van het vak geleerd en een heleboel technische zaken ook maar radio maken als zodanig heb ik in suriname geleerd we hadden daar n taperecorder in de studio en voor de rest ging alles live de lucht in dus elke fout die je maakte werd in heel suriname opgevangen met als gevolg dat je het zo goed mogelijk probeerde te doen in nederland dacht ik alleen maar wat zijn ze hier verwend

1110380 wow thats not what i expected from a church and i cant wait to come back
1110381 i think it came together out of a general openness on the part of everybody in the band to stretch themselves a little bit genre wise the other mc and i were performing with mackenzie the viola player so at first it was just the 3 of us with some djs then andy suggested hey why dont you combined this into a live band i think if you had a cool band behind you it would work so we tried it for one show and the audience responded and we enjoyed it and then it became what you see today
1110382 you know a 6 person band is a lot of people and a lot of dynamics i dont think were looking to add anything i think were excited to write new songs ourselves stretch our instruments stretch our sound in new directions theres a whole lot more that we can do and were really excited to do it
1110383 i think its several things one that music is powerful i dont know if people are recognizing how powerful music is if you look at any social movement in the united states music has been a big part of it look at the civil rights movement people were singing songs as they were being threatened with beatings and threatened with arrests as they were in jail they kept themselves energized by singing they were able to stand up to folks and claim the moral high ground by singing theres a lot of history there the music being powerful we wanna try and reclaim that and do it in a way thats relevant for 2008
1110384 im actually pretty outside the loop with the music business im not honestly affected by it or a part of it personally for me the most important thing as an artist is for people to hear something ive created thats the most gratifying thing obviously it is good to make a living off of it as well my feeling has always been when youre really small you want people to hear your music so i dont care if people burn the cd while im small cause i want them to hear it when you get big enough you get to the point where youd kinda be an asshole if you got too upset about it because youre doing what you love youre living off of it in the middle theres an artist that really makes a lot theres a sense of support any way you can truth is people make their money off of live shows i think the way that it is changing its inevitable people that understand that and adapt to it will be the ones that come out on top we dont focus all of our energy on loss of cd sales we focus our energy on our live show and word of mouth we get people excited enough that they want to support us however we can i think thats the way to succeed
1110385 y que ya sobrepas al estado y nos sobrepas a todos

1110396 i am also excited about the promotions for jamie and nelson in the time i have spent with jamie i have come to admire his work ethic his passion and the knowledge he possesses at the same time nelson and bill were professional players and very good players and their knowledge of our club will be invaluable to me and our entire staff as we move forward

1110418 we applaud the cdcs efforts to provide a clearer picture of the aids epidemic
1110419 while the federal governments focus in recent years on testing care and treatment has saved the lives of many people living with hiv aids these new numbers clearly indicate that this approach has done little to prevent new infections
1110420 these numbers are unacceptable for all of america at nmac we consider hiv aids just one symptom of an overall health emergency in this country particularly in communities of color which have been disproportionately impacted by hiv aids since the epidemic began three decades ago
1110421 ethnicity is not a risk factor for hiv aids which of course can impact anyone regardless of age gender or race however the limited access to support services such as education and health care and high rates of homelessness malnutrition substance use incarceration and poverty unfortunately found in many minority communities has left their members immuno suppressed and more susceptible to hiv aids and its co morbidities like diabetes tuberculosis heart disease hypertension and hepatitis a b and c

1110506 as many of you know caleb was nominated by dr savage so that he may receive a wish through the make a wish foundation when we moved to san antonio the wish connection at amp t adopted calebs wish from make a wish caleb asked for his room to become a cowboy room we really expected just a few pictures on the walls maybe some curtains and bedding but it turned out to be soooo much more i really do not have any words to describe what our family experienced this weekend we left on friday afternoon to experience our first part of calebs cowboy weekend we were put in the presidential suite at the hyatt wow when we arrived at the hyatt the entire staff greeted us in the driveway with applause and balloons for the kids a real rodeo cowboy aubrey was waiting to greet caleb caleb went right to him and was his friend right away my favorite part of this was caleb holding a fistful of balloons and pretending he was floating away he is not shy and made everyone laugh we then went to the top floor of the hyatt and were greeted with more applause and balloons in the hallway when we got to our suite there was chips salsa guacamole potato chips huge cookies milk chocolate covered strawberries soda and tons o candy in the dining room in the parlor were gifts for everyone in the family and a beautiful pair of leather cowboy boots for caleb cowboy aubrey was carrying his rope with him and decided he wanted caleb to have it what makes this gift so special is that it was aubreys personal rope given to him by a very famous cowboy it has been used for practice and in rodeos caleb was sooo thrilled that he slept next to the rope and boots when he went to be that night we will never forget aubrey and how special he made caleb feel when everyone left the suite it was time for us to check it out it had a foyer a parlor dining room living room small kitchen a balcony 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms it was all marble granite and wood every room had fresh flowers and a huge tv they even had the newest kids dvds for the kids to watch it was amazing we were treated to a riverboat ride and dinner at the rainforest cafe that night before bed the doorbell rang yes a doorbell and there were 2 ladies standing there with the biggest banana splits ever the kids were thrilled the staff at the hyatt was amazing and made our stay so comfortable we felt like we were on vacation even though we were only 20 minutes from home the next day we set off for y itsa ranch for some riding caleb and abby each brought a friend the owners of this ranch were so kind and generous i do not have many pictures of that in here since my camera died when we got there but lots of other people were taking pictures so i will post some soon it was a beautiful ranch they greeted us with the largest horse and the smallest horse of the farm just the most gentle animals ever the kids also got to meet and ride a horse that just gave birth 4 months ago after some riding we took a break and had the most beautiful cowboy cake ever it was so detailed i have to mention that it was also the most delicious cake ever again there were gifts for caleb and abby then we got to see lots of turtle and some miniature horses and ponies then there was more riding our 3 kids slept the whole way home we had a fantastic time and plan on being regulars at the ranch upon arriving home we noticed balloons and a big moon bounce in our backyard we were greeted by a yard full of wish granters and friends there were decorations and food galore caleb and abby opened more gifts it was so nice of everyone to include abby in everything caleb got a pair of real spurs for his boots a belt and buckle cowboy cut wrangler jeans a cowboy hat and a george strait button up shirt i didnt even have time to take pictures at the party but i know they are out there it was incredible and overwhelming it is a rare occasion when i am at a loss for words but i was for a long time we went upstairs to see calebs bedroom and we were blown away every piece of furniture in the room was brand new and cowboy themed they thought of every detail down to the leather piping around the duvet cover and window treatments with leather detail and murals done free hand on his walls this room is incredible and by far the best room in our house now caleb loves it so much and doesnt want to leave his room we have all been spending lots of time in there today every time i think i have seen everything in the room i am surprised by another thoughtful detail i will let the pictures speak for themselves there was also a videographer who was taping from start to finish we are thrilled that we will have video to remember this weekend and humbled that he would use his entire weekend filming our family we were sooo humbled this weekend our family is not anyone special but so many people wanted to help create this special weekend for us and a special room for our son i loved seeing how gregarious and friendly our children were with everyone they met i loved that they were not spoiled by all the gifts and attention they were thrilled about every little detail the gummy worms and m n ms and having a coffee pot in their hotel bathroom was exciting for them you would think abby would be jealous but handled the whole weekend with the dignity and grace that many adults dont possess she told me that she was so glad to see caleb having his special day and i could tell she really meant it this process really helped to make san antonio feel like home and it brought closure to that chapter in our lives i still dont have the words to say what this meant to us it was calebs wish but it was wonderful for the entire family i hope the wish connection at amp t understand how special they made us feel and how much it means to us that they would use so much of their personal time to make a wish come true for a 4 year old boy i know our whole family has learned from them and will use this experience to pay it forward and make a wish come true for someone else

1110622 i was in a personnel meeting with rick spielman and george paton until 11 oclock with the coaches i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other we havent had any contact with them
1110623 my comment would be i think thats the same journalist that wrote that there was a cell phone involved that the packers gave favre
1110624 ive seen it but havent had a lot of discretionary time to sit and watch television or sit in front of the internet

1110669 i just cant believe theyre going to deny a member of congress the right of reviewing how they plan to conduct the government of the united states after a significant terrorist attack
1110670 were talking about the continuity of the government of the united states of america
1110671 i would think that would be relevant to any member of congress let alone a member of the homeland security committee
1110672 maybe the people who think theres a conspiracy out there are right
1110673 i find it inexplicable and probably reflective of the usual knee jerk overextension of executive power that we see from this white house
1110674 the president can declare to the office of the presidency powers usually assumed by dictators to direct any and all government and business activities until the emergency is declared over
1110675 epa traditionally has put the highest value on life of any government agency and still does despite efforts by administrations to bring uniformity to that figure among all departments
1110676 it appears that theyre cooking the books in regards to the value of life
1110677 those decisions are literally a matter of life and death
1110678 its hard to imagine that it has other than a political motivation

1110683 weve had a little bit of that over in france with the corvette at le mans
1110684 but this was good fun now ive got to make dale jr let me run next week when the nationwide series goes to watkins glen
1110685 the rain tire everybody had questions about it but it worked
1110686 i dont know if i would have wanted to be out there on dry tires that were nine years old but the rain tires held up very well
1110687 i felt like i dominated the race i feel really disappointed i felt like it was our race today
1110688 i think when drivers are saying enough is enough weve got to heed that warning and we didnt do a good job of that today
1110689 we have a proud history in racing with 54 continuous years of nascar involvement and have enjoyed worldwide success in all forms of racing
1110690 but all should be assured that no one was more disappointed than we were with the events in indianapolis
1110691 we are the first to admit that we missed the mark with the combination for this race there are many reasons but they are only important today from the perspective that we learn from those issues and move forward successfully
1110692 the knowledgeable people in our business understand the solution to this issue involves all elements of the equation
1110693 we are committed to working to bring those elements together in a manner that will produce consistent great racing
1110694 our responsibility is to provide a tire that works with all of the variables and we take that responsibility very seriously
1110695 we have been performance partners with nascar for more than 50 years and we are absolutely committed to remain in that role for another 50 years
1110696 i felt like turn 2 i really got well through the tunnel
1110697 obviously we have those notes from the previous race to go back on and we also unloaded in race trim yesterday and were fairly happy with our car
1110698 we would have definitely liked to have gotten some laps in i think everybody here would have but i dont think were really too concerned about it our ford was pretty fast
1110699 definitely at pocono track position is every bit as important if not more important than anywhere we race so starting up there and having good pit stops all day will be key
1110700 the bonus points were giving up to kyle busch right now
1110701 youve got jimmie johnson now that has won his second race carl edwards has won three
1110702 you just dont want to give up any points to those guys going into the chase
1110703 i really think as a race team if you just put us equal with everybody right now i think we have a shot at the championship
1110704 when you put us 20 30 70 points behind those three guys thats tough to overcome
1110705 i think we can maybe even win some races in the chase but to go out there and outperform those guys every single weekend and make up all those points is tough to do
1110706 good thing we ran some race trims in practice yesterday which typically this year we havent been doing in practice
1110707 we have been going straight to qualifying trim i think it was a good call to run some race runs the car was comfortable and i think it will race good obviously we didnt qualify good but i am confident that we are going to race well we always do
1110708 we pitted a lap later than the leaders on lap 167 of 200 so i thought maybe the 20 runner up tony stewart and the 99 winner carl edwards might have trouble or something but we ran out going through turn 3
1110709 im really shocked we ran out of gas i thought we had a lap to the good and ended up almost a corner short
1110710 we are the first to admit that we missed the mark with the combination for this race
1110711 there are many reasons but they are only important today from the perspective that we learn from those issues and move forward successfully
1110712 our responsibility is to provide a tire that works with all of the variables and we take that responsibility very seriously
1110713 we have been performance partners with nascar for more than 50 years and we are absolutely committed to remain in that role for another 50 years
1110714 we have them available in the nationwide series primarily for scheduling reasons

1110732 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
1110733 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
1110734 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
1110735 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
1110736 us polls indicate that most of the amateur skeptics are republicans these republican skeptics should wonder how presidential candidate john mccain could have been taken in

1110766 given the wide range of efforts that will hopefully continue to expand it might appear that research gaps would be difficult to identify however on the contrary this project team found a number of very important gaps
1110767 in the long term it is essential to promote the economic feasibility of second generation biofuels
1110768 this publication has identified gaps within these areas which must be addressed to more quickly move the product from the laboratory to the billion gallon scale that represents the daily international consumption of liquid transportation fuels currently derived from petroleum
1110769 the bioprocessing of cellulosic material has significant potential but key impediments exist for the economical attractive implementation of procession technology that would convert a solid cellulosic feedstock into a liquid fuel
1110770 while a number of research initiatives are examining the effect of hydrolysis on cell wall structure research on pretreatment that economically modifies this structure to improve downstream processing is needed
1110771 the feedstocks created by the process is a first step and could lead to a catalytic conversion process that generates liquid transportation fuels
1110772 i like to leave town when the news is about me

1110795 that four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason
1110796 justice must be done there and must be seen to be done there fairly and impartially
1110797 and we will not let it go to anybody else
1110798 the most prominent dividing line in iraqi politics now is between the powers that be and the powers that arent
1110799 the powers that be spent much of the 1980s and 1990s in open opposition to saddam
1110800 which would make the system more inclusive and give the powers that arent and the popular forces they represent an opportunity for a share of the power
1110801 you can consider diwaniya as the heart of the middle of iraq
1110802 they offered me a chance to come back to the army but i refused
1110803 i was very candid with him about how frustrated we were
1110804 i told him that the iraqi soldiers had only five rounds of ammo per weapon that there was no system in place to request more that most of the soldiers did not have sapi
1110805 plates for their flak jackets that there was no mechanism for us to buy food or water for the troops that they did not even have a barracks to sleep in
1110806 when i left in 2005 people were complaining more and more about the militia problem but at the same time there was a drawdown of american forces in the south which was the real seat of power for the iraqi government i remember driving to karbala in a convoy and being stopped by a supposed iraqi police unit dressed in green uniforms i e mailed general petraeus to ask if he knew who they were and he did not know anything about it it was another new militia roaming freely
1110807 ever since falluja in 2004 i felt i had not accomplished my mission
1110808 i was home in the inactive reserves and i still missed fighting in iraq when seth talked to me about the team and the mission i did not believe we could fix anything it sounded suicidal at best but this is my friend and i will do anything to help him out
1110809 the provincial elections are very important because they have the potential to usher in new leadership that is not drawn from the former exiles
1110810 the supreme council and dawa have not excelled at governance at the local level if they cannot prevent elections and it is probably too late for that they will try to delegitimize the sadrists and control the process though the domination they have accumulated over the years at the local level dawa for example has used its control over the iraqi red crescent to appoint local officials to make sure they bring out the vote
1110811 the big thing going forward is the improved security environment and political development that allows the parties and other actors to feel they have a fair shot at being part of the game so essentially how the elections are conducted and how they are perceived is important another very important issue is governmental capacity to deliver the goods iraqis know that the price of oil per barrel is changing
1110812 insisted that their problem with al qaeda was akin to the souths problem with jaish al mahdi
1110813 and that the tribes would rise up in the same way
1110814 their plea was help us to get organized and we can throw off this thing called the mahdi army and we can get the tribal society dominant again in the south and we can begin to bring social order to the south akin to the way sunni tribes had brought social order back to anbar province
1110815 it was like we were the insurgents the mahdi militias were in control of the city
1110816 we used to hear about a killing episode every day
1110817 he told them if you leave the town now you would never be able to come back
1110818 the supreme council controlled the governorship the tribal movement was a way to break the incumbent parties monopoly on power if our end goal is democracy this is a pretty big deal the southern provincial governors that i dealt with would not shake my hand they do not believe in secular government they do not believe in a government that is not controlled by religion the fact that every other man will shake my hand except for the power brokers says that we are backing a very extremist regime
1110819 you could patrol a mere five blocks north east south or west of nahda and find the same poverty violence fear and hopelessness that had plagued nahda only a few weeks earlier
1110820 the prime minister said look it is different in the south
1110821 there is not the same security imperative there the iraqi security forces can take on the security threat that comes from militias it is not a question of the tribes being actively in bed with the militia there is a different security dynamic the awakening would be a political movement that is not what the coalition should be doing i think he did not want us to be creating political movements to challenge him i have got to say there is some merit to that
1110822 there is no big local support for the governor and the supreme council the services are worse now than they were before them they are not competent people are no longer supporting them
1110823 we dont think that there is a necessity to form awakening councils here
1110824 the tribes didnt confront the terrorists the local and federal governments did
1110825 the united states and multinational force iraq congratulate the government of iraq on this important milestone
1110826 the provincial and military leadership in qadisiya will have to work cooperatively in order to attain the sustainable security necessary for long term economic prosperity
1110827 maybe the lesson is there are limits to what we can and cannot do in iraq ive tried separating myself from our work with the sahawa
1110828 and i cant i cant ever face the tribes i worked with again because i broke a lot of promises those promises dont mean much to anyone outside diwaniya or to an overall strategy for this war but i thought these were the promises my own government had sent me year after year to pursue so while i would deploy again for my marines and my iraqi army comrades i dont want to go to iraq again if this is the way we do business
1110829 this war is critical to our national security interests and has had an impact on al qaeda i know we are creating a buffer zone
1110830 we will not create a well functioning democracy in iraq but we need to leave the region and iraq in a stronger position than we went in both for their own security and to avoid another terrorist attack on america i would do whatever general petraeus asked or needed i trust him and his character with my life
1110831 im not going to be forced out of my house by some ghost
1110832 i will be for change and ill bring you change
1110833 everyone assumes that every calculator they use will produce an accurate result but in reality there are vast inconsistencies between the calculations being done
1110834 i wouldnt grab a calculator and say heres the ton i just reduced because you dont know that for sure
1110835 i dont think a calculator can give you that kind of guide
1110836 there are so many different ways to calculate using different variables different standards and different assumptions
1110837 theres no one absolute right best number so each calculator seems to use something different
1110838 the other problem is that individual calculators dont tell you the assumptions behind their calculations
1110839 even if there isnt one standard calculator they should at least be able to be transparent so people know whats being included what isnt being included and whats not being calculated
1110840 the calculators probably underestimate emissions and so offsets may not cover everything
1110841 if youre just trying to identify big areas in your life that are producing carbon theres no question that theres a value there
1110842 imperfect information is better than none at all otherwise wed be operating completely in the dark
1110843 i want to move away from calculators and tell people more what they can do
1110844 there are individual things we know we need to do in our lifestyles but i think that if you use a calculator to make a change you may find yourself being disappointed over time
1110845 we need to create a culture of people doing those small things that will result in big change
1110846 white house officials repeatedly pressed fbi director robert mueller to prove it was a

1110856 los perros guardianes de solares obras locales o establecimientos deber n estar bajo la vigilancia de sus due os o personas responsables a fin de que no puedan causar da os a las personas o sus bienes en la v a p blica ni perturbar la tranquilidad ciudadana en especial en horas nocturnas
1110857 los pol ticos tienen un rostro p blico pero en la realidad este rostro es otro sta es una de las muchas cosas que suceden a diario en varias oficinas de gobierno que muchos desconocemos porque no se denuncian p blicamente
1110858 si esto me sucede a m que me s defender c mo le ir a los pobres y a quienes llegan del interior del estado y nadie los atiende les dan el cl sico capotazo y adi s mientras los ciudadanos sigamos en el ltimo lugar de los pendientes de las autoridades no importa qu color de partido nos gobierne nunca saldremos adelante

1110865 reach will have a far reaching effect on any company that buys sells or uses chemicals
1110866 inevitably all companies that use chemicals or make products that contain chemicals will be affected and that pretty much sums up the entire electronics supply chain the survey clearly indicates that our industry is woefully unprepared for the hit its about to take
1110867 african elephants are being slaughtered for their ivory at a pace unseen since an international ban on the ivory trade took effect in 1989
1110868 why isnt the world as angry about this as it was in 1989 according to the authors people just arent hearing enough about the situation i guess the media is too busy telling us about brangelinas babies to care about whats happening in africa and asia
1110869 senator barack obama says while the increased number of u s troops contributed to increased security in iraq he also credits the sunni awakening and the shia government going after militias and says that there might have been improved security even without the surge whats your response to that

1110876 among the categories dead dying and threatened i would put the ganga in the dying category
1110877 in all poor planning and inadequate protection of natural means have ensured that the world population can no longer assume that water is going to flow forever
1110878 dams and channelising destroy habitats cuts rivers off from their floodplains and alter the natural ebb and flow on which a rivers plants and animals depend invasive species crowd rivers banks drive out native fish and choke their courses pollution fouls their waters sometimes turning life giving rivers into threats to human health and climate change threatens to alter all the rules that rivers have lived by for thousands of years
1110879 lowering water levels have indirectly led to deficiencies in organic content of the soil and reduced agricultural productivity over extraction of ground water has affected the water quality inadequate recharging of groundwater impairs the natural cleansing of arsenic which becomes water soluble when exposed to air threatening the health of the people likely to use it climate change will excarberate the problems caused by water extraction the himalayan glaciers are estimated to supply 30 to 40 per cent of the water in the ganga which is particularly critical in dry seasons prior to monsoon
1110880 on a scale of one to 10 i would put indias capacity to meet with challenges ahead at 0 5 points everyone seems to be talking about climate change but as an actual measure very little is being done
1110881 adaptation will be necessary to address impacts resulting from the warming which is already unavoidable due to past emissions we need much more work on the monsoon given its importance to life and agriculture in this country the country has to devise anticipatory measures including protective infrastructure and encouraging natural methods

1111091 r gsk r is a modest rocky island situated 15 kilometres off the coast of central finland mostly red but sometimes a faded yello w or green a few small wooden cottages are scattered along the shoreline bearing witness to human presence within a space where otherwise there is none the island is a place where real and unreal finally dissolves a place that can only exist in imagination the island can only be touched in pictures by circumventing the usual way of the camera and each image in the series is consequently an interpretation and a recreation in miniature of a holiday photograph lifted from its carefully arranged space in the family album rather than being tied to the physical properties of the real world these images look to tease out the character and personality of a rather shy dot in the sea the photographs make visible something akin to an introspect reality which nonetheless seems just as real

1111095 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1111096 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role

1111125 i was able to spend my childhood in the center of a bright literary scene
1111126 i decided to write this novel because the atomic bombing is one of the three incidents that shocked the foundation of this planet
1111127 on aug 6 1945 humans got to know that they obtained the power to destroy everything
1111128 if i hadnt seen her i probably would not have written the novel
1111129 an atomic bomb is a very tragic and hateful theme something that contrasts with that theme is love
1111130 i love japan and have japanese friends from a long time ago
1111131 i wanted to know the japanese mind and really tried hard to reach that level to write the story
1111132 the number of countries that possess this deadly weapon has been increasing
1111133 i think this is not just a problem for japan but for the rest of the world
1111134 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
1111135 i really appreciate manny being here but i dont think hes our savior
1111136 everybody wants him to be and man i hope he is but we still have to pitch and we still have to play now that were going to play with him hell make us better and well make him better
1111137 i mean he hit 70 home runs in one year mannys not going to do that hopefully itll just be easier for us to score runs than before when it was such a nail pulling issue for us
1111138 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy
1111139 i was planning to play in japan but maybe now i change my plans and play in america
1111140 there are so many and they are playing so good so consistent
1111141 i need to improve i learned a lot this week and im going to prepare for the next part of the season
1111142 to finish with a birdie was special there didnt seem to be any doubt it was going in
1111143 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
1111144 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
1111145 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
1111146 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
1111147 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
1111148 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
1111149 while you have to tune up your condition you have to be well prepared as well
1111150 ive been making people worry but i think i was able to show that im fine today
1111151 i was told that maybe ive gotten better than i was before the injury i could pitch with better mechanics today id like to keep doing it
1111152 it was only an inning but i feel good that i could pitch firmly
1111153 after today i got rid of it worries that he would not play
1111154 hopefully i would like to pitch for a longer time im pretty optimistic that i will be fine
1111155 so id like to push myself by not being afraid no matter what the outcome will be but i am certainly aware of the team the fighters
1111156 but everybodys making the effort and id like the olympic team to do good in beijing as well hopefully we can make it where they arai yano and fujikawa wont have to worry about us too much
1111157 i think once we get together and see other players faces we will feel tense
1111158 itll be different from the pennant race and moreover it wont be held in japan id like to put pressure on myself both mentally and physically and tuneup for beijing
1111159 what do you call a black man with a ph d in neurobiology from harvard who works as a brain surgeon at johns hopkins earns seven figures a year and runs one of the worlds largest philanthropies
1111160 what do you call a white man with degrees from top tier schools who has lived in japan for more than two decades contributes to japanese society as a university educator is fluent in japanese and has japanese citizenship
1111161 i wont use it i wont let it be used
1111162 it was exciting to pitch in a great atmosphere here i wanted to meet the expectations of fans
1111163 as the game progressed i began to think i have to throw a complete game
1111164 you know for as long as i can remember ive had memories
1111165 inasmuch as the production of the televised image of this spectacle is a prop for advertising
1111166 the televised event is a commercial marketable product that must be designed to reach the largest audience and hold onto it the longest
1111167 it follows that the relative importance of the different sports as ranked by the international sports organizations in advance of the games and then by tv during the games especially as regards prime time scheduling increasingly depends on their television popularity and the correlated financial return they promise
1111168 i heard several days later from dr nishinas secretary that a domei reporter who was a friend of dr nishina delivered the truman document on the instructions of domei president inosuke furuno on the morning of aug 7 1945
1111169 sixteen hours ago an american airplane dropped one bomb and destroyed its hiroshimas usefulness as a key military base to the enemy
1111170 its always been a mystery how dr yoshio nishina knew that hiroshima had been hit with an a bomb before even going there it is possible that a domei reporter gave him the copy of trumans statement the fact that the document was stored in nishinas office serves as irrefutable evidence
1111171 this is the first time ive heard about this and its a major discovery
1111172 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
1111173 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
1111174 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
1111175 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
1111176 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1111177 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
1111178 when i got to his cool new office just off of the bedford st stop jay said it didnt really look that bad and gave me some sort of cipro drops which have already started to make a difference total cost 0 if youre a member of their practice which is very reasonable the ability to email and text your doctor then walk right in and have him see you unbelievable

1111181 move it get those shoes on dont look at your watch go go go
1111182 given that we were told that if you are not with ahlta then you are not with the army it is with great skepticism that i involve myself with this forum how can we continue to use a system that continues to reduce our productivity does not allow us to adequately document proper patient exams and is burdensome to recall data while experiencing numerous shut downs and downtime for more repairs
1111183 i have lived through several upgrades to ahlta only to see its performance decrease
1111184 an overwhelming perception in most of us of failed execution and a lack of cooperation at the highest levels
1111185 ahlta is the largest impediment to my seeing patients in an expeditious manner the system is flawed and i spend an inordinate amount of time rebooting the system
1111186 if you want to look at a system that is worthy look at the veteran administration it makes sense with the amount of soldiers marines sailors and airmen who are entering the system to have easy access in a centralized medical records system but ahlta is flawed and the patient pays the price realize this is a waste of taxpayer money and at some point its failure needs to be realized save money and incorporate the va system
1111187 forcing every department to use ahlta is ridiculous and causes the emergency department unnecessary delays in treating patients
1111188 i would strongly suggest that the dod consider switching systems to the va system everything ive heard about it from providers is that it is superb it would also obviously make great sense for the dod and va systems to be able to communicate with one another unfortunately ahlta is a debacle it is clumsy difficult to use not intuitive and unreliable it periodically slows to a snail making patient care very inefficient it occasionally crashes completely making patient care unsafe i know that weve invested a lot of in this system but i think its time to cut our losses and switch to the va electronic medical records system
1111189 that much money at stake ahlta contractors including northrop grumman corp would use their clout to resist any change in the status quo
1111190 on march 25 2008 the boards of trustees released their
1111191 ten thousand bucks a cost accelerating at an unsustainable rate
1111192 the appropriate course of action should be a radically new approach to the medicare entitlement program a restructuring of the program towards a transparent means based qualification system is necessary having uncle sam pay for an elective cataract surgery so grandma can go on an african safari is inexcusable in a time of financial collapse
1111193 no to dialysis no to life support no to elective procedures which would include artifical hips and knees no to brand name drugs no to the latest expensive technology we will have to place greater weight on quality of life over quantity of life we will have to demand hospice care in futile situations we will have to demand palliative comfort over slice and dice we will have to reject marginally effective proceduralization and imaging of our elderly we have to we dont have a choice there is no other way
1111194 countries are going to quit investing in the u s why would th e y buy bonds to pay for demented grandma with chf copd dm pvd esrd repeat stay in the icu
1111195 the easiest fairest most effective solution is to allow balance billing on all healthcare transactions as it stands now
1111196 the government prevents physicians from billing the patient in addition to what medicare pays for services
1111197 patients would realize the full cost of the services they demand and so they will demand fewer services and they will demand cheaper services physicians will be paid appropriately for a single visit and so they will not increase volume unnecessarily to compensate for arbitrarily low payment
1111198 forget about changing the rvu system and forget about asking the government to become more involved in the selection of services for certain patients
1111199 in 2005 the medicare fee for a typical 25 to 30 minute office visit to a primary care physician in chicago was 89 64 for a patient with a complex medical condition current procedural terminology cpt code 99214 by contrast medicares fee for a gastroenterologist in the outpatient department of a chicago hospital performing a colonoscopy cpt code 45378 which also takes about 30 minutes was 226 63 and if the specialist performed the procedure in his own office where he pays for equipment and nursing time he could charge medicare 422 90 for his thirty minutes
1111200 i dont think the patients are usually greedy when it comes to the pissing away of healthcare dollars at the end of life but i do think that there comes a point where you cannot justify the resource expenditure for the return on that investment and sadly yes this sounds like a business decision but every other tiny piece of micromanaged healthcare in america is a business why shouldnt this be if you can pay for the liver transplant at the age of 85 go for it if you can foot the bill for 10 years of dialysis and the countless r o sepsis admissions you will incur be my guest
1111201 it seems heartless to say no but why do you think hospitals used to be charity outfits run by tax exempt religious organizations it has become a business and as one it cannot survive if you are expected to give your services away but every year we give a larger and larger percent of that care away the line has to be drawn somewhere beyond which we say no accept this or prepare for the entire works to crash into the ground in a blaze of glory
1111202 i define money or currency as an agreement within a community to use something as a medium of exchange its therefore not a thing its only an agreement like a marriage like a business deal and most of the time its done unconsciously nobodys polled about whether you want to use dollars were living in this money world like fish in water taking it completely for granted
1111203 there are many new agreements being made within communities as to the kind of medium of exchange they are willing to accept
1111204 in britain you can use frequent flier miles as currency
1111205 there are about 300 or 400 private currency systems in japan to pay for any care for the elderly that isnt covered by the national health insurance
1111206 heres how they work lets say that on my street lives an elderly gentleman who is handicapped and cannot go shopping for himself i do the shopping for him i help him with food preparation i help him with the ritual bath which is very important in japan
1111207 for this help i get credits i put those credits in a savings account and when im sick i can have other people provide such services for me or i can electronically send my credits to my mother who lives on the other side of the country and somebody takes care of her
1111208 makes it possible for hundreds of thousands of elderly people to stay in their homes much longer than they otherwise could
1111209 otherwise youd have to put most of these people into a home for seniors which costs an arm and a leg to society and theyre unhappy there so nobodys winning in contrast japan has created a currency for elderly care
1111210 in the united states florida is the only state that has the same density of elderly people as japan does 18 percent of the population is more than 65 years old but florida is a model for our collective future colorado will be there in 2020 germany will be there in 2006 france in 2008 britain in 2012 if you put all of these elderly in homes for seniors youd go bankrupt japan has been looking for another way and has found it by introducing a monetary innovation
1111211 programs range widely from the more programs in east st louis which focuses on health and training and has 12 000 members who exchange 100 000 hours a year to small street projects involving a dozen residents
1111212 in new york mashi blech has been running the member to member time dollar program for sixteen years this is funded by an hmo and offers older residents a catalogue of health related products and activities in exchange for time credits
1111213 it doesnt quite work that way with dollars does it
1111214 one of the two of us has to get dollars by competing for them somewhere outside of our community
1111215 are helping in a lot of communities where conventional money is scarce in ghettos retirement communities high unemployment zones student communities
1111216 there are 31 states in america that are paying employees to start such time dollar systems because it solves social problems says lietaer
1111217 there are some operating in chicago fairly big ones in florida for example in chicago there are entire neighborhoods that used time dollar systems to create a neighborhood watch system that got rid of drugs and gangs its working it doesnt cost anything to the taxpayer it doesnt create a huge bureaucracy and it encourages the solution of the local problems by and with the very people who know most about them
1111218 if you cant compete in the dollar economy youre thrown away
1111219 and found that the quality of the contributions was not negatively impacted by what they call
1111220 the next few years are critical and the united states can play a big role in offering support said steve radelet of the center for global development
1111221 the country is still fragile radelet said that since sirleafs election in 2005 liberia has made great strides in reducing government corruption and improving oversight it may be a somewhat dubious honor but for the second year in a row the world bank said liberia had shown the greatest year to year improvement among the nations on its list of corrupt countries

1111226 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on
1111227 that seems like a sentiment that all genders could get on board with no nbc sports
1111228 really like to let the subject of my untimely dismissal from cnn go once and for all
1111229 you know the policy they didnt have in place when they made the decision to fire me and a few others like me and the one that ive openly criticized them for neglecting to enact and clarify
1111230 revenues from payroll taxes collected in that year will cover only 79 percent of projected benefit expenditures
1111231 but this would not mean that middle class americans would have access to health
1111232 whistleblower laws can protect and reward them if they turn in their employer
1111233 before trying to roll out national health insurance the next administration needs to address the structural problems that undermine the laissez faire chaos that we euphemistically refer to as our health care
1111234 in some cases the nations progress was overshadowed by improvements in other industrialized countries which typically have more centralized health systems which makes it easier to put changes in place
1111235 if washington tackles medicare reform in 2009 it can show americans that it is possible to reduce costs and improve care

1111239 but one can only be glad that there is this marvelous array of work
1111240 the work remains for our times and all times he was quite extraordinary in bringing to us so many examples of the confusion and pain in the world that we still see today and is very apposite in the early 21st century
1111241 its a mistake to say the story of russian dissidents is over
1111242 its a good thing for solzhenitsyn that hes not living in china right now
1111243 there was a moment when the public opinion of the greatest empire in the world involved in the largest war in their history was changed by a few poets

1111246 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1111247 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others

1111251 the negative impact of the currency and rising costs surpassed strong demand in resource exporting countries
1111252 today the joint commission collects 113 million in annual revenue mainly from the fees it charges hospitals for telling them whether they comply with federal regulations
1111253 deeming authority means that if joint commission gives its seal of approval to a hospital cms is satisfied that the hospital is following federal regulations in other words hospitals enrolling in the accreditation program only have to please one master and that master is really nice accrediting 99 of all hospitals it surveys
1111254 the external review of hospital quality a call for greater accountability
1111255 unlikely to detect substandard patterns of care or individual practitioners with questionable skills
1111256 given the serious limitations in joint commissions accreditation program and that efforts to improve this program through informal action by the centers for medicare and medicaid cms have not led to necessary improvements congress should consider giving cms the same kind of authority over joint commissions hospital accreditation program that it has over all other medicare accreditation programs

1111258 in early 1997 hospital borne germs were infecting dozens of patients up to one in five contracted antibiotic resistant germs after open heart surgery dust and flies littered the operating room during surgeries according to internal hospital records obtained by the
1111259 the joint commission learned of a potential infection outbreak after receiving complaints filed by a patient but the organization decided not to visit the hospital or conduct interviews with patients or doctors hospital and court records show
1111260 instead the joint commission reviewed patient files selected and mailed by hospital officials
1111261 a joint commission regional supervisor telephoned the bridgeport hospital on feb 25 1997 according to a hospital memo based on the review he stated that while they appreciated the information which they have received no follow up was deemed by the joint commission to be necessary at this time according to the memo
1111262 but during the same month that joint commission officials closed their inquiry state public health investigators conducted a surprise inspection and found myriad patient care and infection control violations such as failure by surgical assistants to wash hands
1111263 the hospital initiated dozens of reforms after the state inspection and currently is in compliance with all standards according to state public health agencies infection rates have been reduced to less than 1 percent from a high of 20 percent

1111265 joint commission officials said they sent investigators to tour the hospital in august and october 2002 but their findings were withheld from the public if we want any modicum of cooperation from the hospitals they have to feel were not going to put it investigative findings right out on the street the head of the joint commission said
1111266 inspectors from the federal centers for medicare amp medicaid services staged a surprise inspection at palm beach gardens and declared that uncorrected infection control deficiencies represented immediate jeopardy to patients
1111267 joint commission officials said surveys represent a snapshot of quality not guarantees of patient safety

1111288 in a policy making environment that is so clearly and openly influenced by money
1111289 congress will be able to achieve health care reforms that are in the public interest
1111290 good intentioned providers are following what they believe is good care yet here we are saying that 1 3 to 1 2 of most treatment costs are waste if this situation did not come about by purposeful intent then changing the model of how providers treat will not involve them directly but will involve where and how they have been getting their directions of what to do that is getting right down to the very basics of the science behind the system is anyone seriously looking at that
1111291 just how realistically are we going to get the system to be based on value and true effeciveness and how will we get providers to truly follow such guidance if we ever do find it
1111292 so the people who have chosen to become doctors in recent years are i think generally very patient centered

1111298 value added tax or vat is a nationwide tax of 17 5 or occasionally 5 levied on almost all goods sold by retailers
1111299 bundled payments with all of the doctors and the hospital involved in a particular episode of care paid a lump sum which they have to divvy up
1111300 hospitals competed by offering the latest technology and expensive equipment which appeared to be demanded by physicians and accepted by the public as an indicator of quality
1111301 once the new technology was put to use it produced a higher cost inflation rate in medical services
1111302 countries with more doctors tend to spend more on health care
1111303 singapores msa program itself has contributed less to cost control than the more recently introduced supply side tactics
1111304 the well executed medisave scheme in singapore could not contain costs so it is unlikely that such a scheme could do so here
1111305 the practical and spiritual heart of the system lies in control and parsimony
1111306 theres probably no god now stop worrying and get on with your life
1111307 this working group is composed primarily of physicians and public health officials because they know better than anyone whats wrong with the system and whats needed to fix it
1111308 they also were chosen for this panel because they each have a reputation for being professionals who put patients first
1111309 as i see it the larger goal of medicare reform would be to show that lower cost and higher quality do indeed go hand in hand

1111314 at the very least a patient has a right to know the doctor has an interest in the place he is referring the patient to

1111366 what if a business school like harvard business school existed in japan what if classes are offered to businesspeople to learn about strategies over a short period of time in places where people commute after work or on weekends it may help produce competitive businesspeople in japan
1111367 there were few mba holders who wanted to start a business at that time in japan they leveraged their academic experience and landed a job at foreign consulting firms or foreign investment banks

1111478 the proposed rules are intended to establish a new baseline for fairness in how credit card plans operate
1111479 consumers relying on credit cards should be better able to predict how their decisions and actions will affect their costs

1111495 before we ask voters to make a judgment we need to show them what kind of public services will be offered and what financial resources will be used

1111510 recently ten court interpreters from different justice offices attended a six week french language course at kobo segole
1111511 to prepare for the 2009 fifa confederations cup and 2010 fifa world cup the department has identified language practitioners to be trained in different foreign languages
1111512 among the languages identified is french which is predominantly used across the african continent
1111513 presently we have a pool of court interpreters performing tremendous work we agreed as a region to increase court interpreters so as to be ready to deal with high volumes of cases that might arise during and after 2009 confederation cup and 2010 fifa world cup
1111514 the training involves the completion of a six module interpretation course offered by wits university
1111515 the department is impressed by the dedication commitment and work done by court interpreters in our courts
1111516 their work does not go unnoticed we need such a cadre of people in order to continue improving the lives of our people
1111517 the department is charged with the responsibility of administering criminal justice covering court appearances and ensuring that the justice system is not compromised during the events
1111518 furthermore a budget has been allocated for the upgrading of court facilities

1111530 i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and he remained upon him i did not know him but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me
1111531 upon whom you see the spirit descending and remaining on him this is he who baptizes with the holy spirit
1111532 but you shall receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem and all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth
1111533 these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethern
1111534 then the day of pentecost had fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting then there appeared to them divided tongues as of fire and one sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance

1111546 the first thing that winston churchill did upon becoming a cabinet minister in 1908 was to resign his seat in parliament he then proceeded to lose the resulting by election he had to scrabble around for a new seat before he could take office
1111547 churchill had not being acting on a whim it was in those days a constitutional requirement that on the first occasion that you accepted a ministerial position you would offer your constituents the chance to deliver their verdict
1111548 if labour were to replace gordon brown as leader there would be no constitutional requirement for it to ask anybody for permission the convention that required churchill to stand down was finally abolished in 1926 with the passage of the re election of ministers amendment act

1111556 canada is a trading nation and the growth and prosperity of our manufacturers service providers and agricultural producers are improved by access to new markets
1111557 we are disappointed with the breakdown in the negotiations but the wto remains important to canada
1111558 despite the impasse we will continue to press for new trade opportunities through bilateral agreements and renewed efforts at the multilateral level to continue to build the strong canadian economy
1111559 canada entered the wto talks with a balanced agricultural policy to deliver real gains for all canadian farm families
1111560 we worked hard to expand markets for our exporters and we consistently stood up for supply managed sectors and will continue to do so
1111561 it is unfortunate that countries could not come together to level the international playing field for agricultural trade but the government will be there to move the wto talks forward whenever they resume
1111562 the convergence of technologies and industries has dramatically reshaped the communications landscape in recent years

1111570 its that kind of success we are looking for in southern africa
1111571 botswana is a great success story for africa to reach this low level of infection among children born to hiv positive women
1111572 when you have a region where one in four people are living with the virus you need leadership to really galvanize all levels of society community leaders religious leaders everybody to really recognize this as a region of catastrophe
1111573 we were amongst the first to say you really need to understand your epidemic where were the last 1 000 infections whos getting infected and why and then to assist countries to direct their resources toward those most affected populations
1111574 money needs to be spent with the greatest possible impact and the way you do that is to have a clearer idea about what is actually driving the epidemic in any particular country and having a response that actually reflects the reality of the epidemic
1111575 its to help people really understand how you can go wrong and invest in the wrong interventions if you dont have the right data and how important it is to have the evidence
1111576 we realized you cannot be effective in tackling concentrated epidemics if you do not work with civil society and peers who have contact with vulnerable groups at highest risk know how to make the money work

1111580 cointelpro began in 1956 in part because of frustration with supreme court rulings limiting the governments power to proceed overtly against dissident groups
1111581 many of the techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity but cointelpro went far beyond that the bureau conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of first amendment rights of speech and association on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence
1111582 media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups
1111583 harassment through the legal system the fbi and police abused the legal system to officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment they discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance investigative interviews and grand jury beatings the object was to frighten dissidents and disrupt their movements in the case of radical black and these attacks including political assassinations were so extensive vicious and calculated that they can accurately be termed a form of official black bag jobs
1111584 purpose of counterintelligence action is to disrupt the black panther party and it is immaterial whether facts exist to substantiate the charge

1111588 we are against the government that will persecute the palestinian people
1111589 in other words these governments are saying that if the united states will let us exist as a class to oppress our african people then we will cooperate in other words black oppressing black we know that without the support of the united states imperialism no reactionary government can exist so we are very careful when we start supporting a government that has relationships in support of the united states
1111590 the only way to start changing the racist nature of the society is to revolutionize or transform the institutions
1111591 as far as the israeli people are concerned we are not against the jewish people we are against that government that will persecute the palestinian people we have to admit that there is something wrong in the middle east the palestinian people are living in hovels they dont have any land theyve been stripped and murdered and we cannot support that for any reason
1111592 who were working to see that the zionist government of israel is transformed into a secular peoples state
1111593 we are chiefly interested in the survival of our people but not at the expense of other people
1111594 we have a long history of being enslaved and murdered we have wrestled with the question of nationalism and we have concluded we have a moral right to embrace nationalism we have a moral right to choose separatism just as the jewish people have that moral right but we realize that the united states will not allow us to separate and live side by side with united states imperialism its obvious that we cannot become self determined because the united states will not let countries exist 15 million miles away in freedom so they will certainly not let us exist in a separate state in north america in freedom so the question can be put into the future
1111595 our central task is the overthrow of the ruling circle who will not permit the question of self determination to exist in this world
1111596 this transformation can only take place by wiping out united states imperialism and establishing a new earth a new society a new world so politically and strategically the correct action to take is not separation but world revolution in order to wipe out imperialism then people will be free to decide their destiny self determination and national liberation can not really exist while united states imperialism is alive that is why we dont support nationalism as our goal
1111597 the motives are internationalist because the revolutionists are attempting to secure liberated territory in order to choke imperialism by cutting them off from the countryside however when the motive for national liberation is solely to create a capitalist state so that the ruling circle of that capitalist state can align itself with u s imperialism then it is reactionary nationalism and cannot be supported by revolutionaries
1111598 israel was created by western imperialism and maintained by western fire power the jewish people have a right to exist there as long as they exist to down the reactionary expansionist israeli government the african american situation is similar in so many ways we say that morally perhaps the jewish people can make a case for separatism and a zionist state based upon their religion for self defense we say morally perhaps we could accept this but politically and strategically we know it is incorrect in the first place it is perpetuating nationalism if nationalism is reaction and i think the united states proves this by using nationalism to rape the world and dominate everyone else in other words it went from nationalism to the natural conclusion which is empire or imperialism so the jewish people must be careful not to be an agent of imperialism
1111599 living god is the son of man the supreme being or the black man of asia

1111656 inflating your tires and getting a regular tune up sounds more like obamas plan for ego maintenance than it does for helping american families

1111684 over the years ive found these factors used with expert analysis deliver extremely impressive yields
1111685 should the state departments annual report on trafficking which grades governments on how well they are combating modern slavery consider whether governments put traffickers in jail the justice department says no should the homeland security and health and human services departments streamline their efforts to help foreign trafficking victims get visas and care no should the homeland security health and human services state and justice departments pool their data on human trafficking to help devise strategies to prevent it amazingly no should the justice department prosecute the american sex tourists who create demand for adult human trafficking victims in foreign countries no should congress make clear that there should be increased penalties for americans who sexually abuse children abroad no way should we give our courts jurisdiction over americans who traffic human beings abroad certainly not should the attorney general include information in his annual report on his departments efforts to enforce anti trafficking laws against federal contractors and employees no too burdensome says the justice department
1111686 in this case the feminist religious and secular groups that help sex trafficking survivors are on one side and on the other are the departments lawyers most of them male the erotic service providers union and the american civil liberties union this side believes that vast numbers of woman engage in prostitution as a profession by choice

1111912 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden on macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities
1111913 policy as well as market interest rates could rise and a sharp deceleration in growth may follow
1111914 greater government borrowing needs while not leading to a material deterioration of its key credit metrics would likely prevent an improvement in the remainder of fy08 09 contrary to our earlier expectation
1111915 elections are due in less than a years time and it is not clear whether the new coalition partners would support further reforms that could alleviate the economic stresses
1111916 other analysts also felt the indian economy would slowdown in the current financial year
1111917 we expect gdp growth to moderate to 7 5 per cent in 2008 and to 8 1 per cent in 2009 from 9 3 per cent in 2007 with downside risks to this forecast

1111938 the goal of having no meca team members present was to prevent them from being asked any questions that could reveal information before nasa is ready to make an announcement sources say
1111939 the bush administrations presidential science advisors office however has been briefed on the new information that nasa hopes to release as early as mid august
1111940 not true meca results have not been discussed at the white house
1111941 there is no one who knows either on the phoenix project in tucson or at nasa hq who knows where this information came from

1111959 we do not have any rules governing internet network management to enforce
1111960 for the first time in internet history we say goodbye to the era of collaboration that served the internet community and consumers so well for so long and we say hello to unneeded regulation and all of its unintended consequences
1111961 rather than assuming the role of world wide web enforcer perhaps the best way for the fcc to fulfill our duties under internet policy statement would be to assume the role of mediator or arbitrator helping to facilitate agreements among the various sectors of the broadband internet industry
1111962 commissioner tate and i received the current version of the order at 7 p m last night with about half of its content added or modified
1111963 as a result even after my office reviewed this new draft into the wee hours of the morning i can only render a partial analysis
1111964 specifically the commission found that comcast had deployed equipment throughout its network to monitor the content of its customers internet connections and selectively block specific types of connections known as peer to peer connections
1111965 the truth is the fcc does not know what comcast did or did not do
1111966 the evidence in the record is thin and conflicting all we have to rely on are the apparently unsigned declarations of three individuals representing the complainants view some press reports and the conflicting declaration of a comcast employee
1111967 for the first time today our government is choosing regulation over collaboration when it comes to internet governance
1111968 the majority has thrust politicians and bureaucrats into engineering decisions it will be interesting to see how the fcc will handle its newly created power because as an institution we are incapable of deciding any issue in the nanoseconds of internet time
1111969 wrote researchers eric horvitz of microsoft and jure leskovec of carnegie mellon university in a paper that was presented earlier this year at the www 2008 conference in beijing
1111970 we might say that via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people
1111971 atribuo a pobreza com que estamos gerindo os nossos recursos ao impasse criado pelo minist rio p blico
1111972 as pessoas falam que n o confiam no que o conselho vai fazer com o dinheiro isso um absurdo
1111973 essa discuss o passa pela credibilidade das institui es o que precisa fortalecer os conselhos e cobrar transpar ncia de suas a es
1111974 o empres rio diz que quer saber onde o dinheiro vai ser aplicado assim como todos n s queremos isso se faz atrav s de presta o de contas
1111975 quem escolhe o projeto o conselho n o somos n s
1111976 n s n o escolhemos o projeto o que a petrobras n o abre m o de ter identificado no conv nio a institui o que receber a doa o para que a gente saiba se os recursos foram efetivamente utilizados e quais os resultados concretos desse investimento
1111977 o que achamos que se esse problema progredir as empresas v o parar de doar dinheiro as empresas n o confiam que o dinheiro colocado no fundo sem nenhuma destina o espec fica ser bem aplicado
1111978 se o conselho considera que o tema est dentro da sua pol tica de atendimento ele seleciona projetos do seu munic pio e envia para a funda o isso significa que quem faz a primeira sele o o conselho
1111979 estamos convencidos de que temos um procedimento correto tanto que a telef nica n o deixou de contribuir para fundos da inf ncia
1111980 bvio que nenhuma empresa nenhum cidad o vai contribuir com risco de sofrer a o de improbidade do minist rio p blico vai optar por outra rea
1111981 a rea da inf ncia continua recebendo investimento das empresas mas o trabalho de corpo a corpo para ampliar esses investimentos por meio dos fias n o est mais na linha de prioridade
1111982 todos querem a mesma coisa conseguir recursos para a rea da inf ncia e da adolesc ncia e que esses recursos sejam bem utilizados se engessarmos demais n o vamos conseguir ter o dinamismo que o fundo necessita mas sem disciplina fica fr gil
1111983 estando nesta luta h anos sugiro que seja melhor estudado e refletido o artigo 248 do eca que me parece abre ou facilita o caminhos para regularizar o trabalho infantil dom stico
1111984 deixar de apresentar autoridade judici ria de seu domic lio no prazo de cinco dias com o fim de regularizar a guarda adolescente trazido de outra comarca para a presta o de servi o dom stico mesmo que autorizado pelos pais ou respons vel pena multa de tr s a vinte sal rios de refer ncia aplicando se o dobro em caso de reincid ncia independentemente das despesas de retorno do adolescente se for o caso
1111985 proibido qualquer trabalho a menores de dezesseis anos de idade salvo na condi o de aprendiz a partir de quatorze anos
1111986 na poca em que o eca veio baila as discuss es sobre o trabalho infantil no brasil eram ainda embrion rias e talvez o legislador n o tenha se atentado ent o para as poss veis mazelas decorrentes daquela brecha ali prevista
1111987 vejamos na pr tica por que aquele artigo constitui se em brecha possibilitadora de ilegalidades se a crian a a recebida em guarda por b precisa acionar a justi a trabalhista visando ter seus direitos trabalhistas garantidos em face de sua rela o de trabalho mascarada com b por ser menor de idade quem vai represent la ou assisti la perante os tribunais quem det m sua guarda legal ou seja aquele que supostamente viola seus direitos o que tem poder de represent la na justi a a crian a est duplamente desprotegida os institutos s o visceralmente incompat veis
1111988 a legisla o brasileira estabelece que o adolescente s pode trabalhar a partir dos 14 anos na condi o de aprendiz quanto ao trabalho regular e remunerado
1111989 portanto o artigo 248 do eca vem complementar a legisla o trabalhista a fim de que esse dispositivo legal n o seja descumprido
1111990 em minha opini o n o uma prioridade revogar esse dispositivo por m se os ativistas contra o trabalho infantil insistirem na sua revoga o admito que a reda o do referido artigo pode e deve ser aperfei oada
1111991 a vontade do legislador n o foi aprovar a explora o de crian as no trabalho dom stico
1111992 se a fun o da lei de proteger a crian a est gerando na pr tica ambig idades momento para o debate

1112007 existem movimentos empresariais importantes pela causa por meio de projetos focados no fortalecimento dos conselhos est mulo doa o etc o que h um preconceito sobre as a es de origem privada nesses fundos de que se trata de marketing ou de levar vantagem
1112008 tamb m deve se levar em conta a pr pria descri o dos projetos aprovados nada se fala sobre isso posto que incumbe toda a sociedade a prote o da inf ncia e da adolesc ncia e assim por dever republicano o conselho deve divulgar as a es que selecionou e o destino dos recursos
1112009 percentual de projetos chancelados limitado a um ter o do montante total dos recursos dos projetos financiados pelos fundos dos direitos da crian a e do adolescente

1112023 this boy has killed nearly 60 of these animals in mexico theres video of him inflicting death on the web we decided to prevent him from fighting in france
1112024 what fans of corrida dont understand is the bloodshed and agony that draw them to the event is the same thing that repels the public once its forced to look at it
1112025 the raising and selling of bulls has played a large role in our economic social and cultural past and they still figure large in this seasonal festivity
1112026 its seen here by most people as an injustice and a mean spirited effort to impose one kind of thinking on attitudes and events rooted in tradition
1112027 weve noticed that a number of users have had their blogs mistakenly marked as spam and wanted to sound off real quick to let you know that despite it being friday afternoon we are working hard to sort this out so to those folks who have received an email saying that your blog has been classified as spam and cant post right now we offer our sincere apologies for the trouble

1112057 i regard my work on alchemy as a sign of my inner relationship to goethe goethes secret was that he was in the grip of that process of archetypal transformation which has gone on through the centuries he regarded his faust as an opus magnum or divinum he called it his main business and his whole life was enacted within the framework of this drama thus what was alive and active within him was a living substance a super personal process the great dream of the mundus archetypus archetypal world
1112058 for jung goethe exemplified the premise enunciated by hermetic magi of the more distant past from paracelsus and agrippa back to zosimus and the practitioners of ancient alexandria that the alchemist must ultimately be the subject and object of his own experiment an experiment by which he himself is transmuted

1112090 as a result even after my office reviewed this new draft into the wee hours of the morning i can only render a partial analysis
1112091 specifically the commission found that comcast had deployed equipment throughout its network to monitor the content of its customers internet connections and selectively block specific types of connections known as peer to peer connections
1112092 the truth is the fcc does not know what comcast did or did not do
1112093 the evidence in the record is thin and conflicting all we have to rely on are the apparently unsigned declarations of three individuals representing the complainants view some press reports and the conflicting declaration of a comcast employee
1112094 for the first time today our government is choosing regulation over collaboration when it comes to internet governance
1112095 the majority has thrust politicians and bureaucrats into engineering decisions it will be interesting to see how the fcc will handle its newly created power because as an institution we are incapable of deciding any issue in the nanoseconds of internet time

1112098 the operational cost of doing business in north america and around the world is steadily increasing especially when it comes to freight and transportation
1112099 this economic reality makes it necessary for ingram micro to globally adjust current freight and sales terms and conditions to allow for rising fuel freight and handling costs
1112100 we recognize these are added costs which you may choose to absorb or pass along to your customers and that is why we will continue to offer multiple shipping options
1112101 ultimately our goal is to address the rising cost of freight and use our core logistics expertise and scale to help you manage your costs as best we can this was a difficult decision but a necessary one ingram micro remains committed to ensuring your shipments reach their destinations in a timely and efficient manner
1112102 as you are aware the cost of fuel has impacted many industries
1112103 in an effort to protect our customers from freight price increases and to maintain our low minimum free freight thresholds d amp h has moved its primary default small package carrier from ups to fed ex ground effective immediately
1112104 if your shipment qualifies for free freight d amp h will ship via fedex ground although you will still have the option to select ups as your carrier of choice along with the up charge
1112105 we have been evaluating this for quite some time as well weve had some it projects underway to make sure we have as little disruption as possible were still going to talk to customers as well before the definitive numbers are worked
1112106 some will look at it as a cost increase and nobodys going to be completely comfortable with that many resellers pass freight charges on to their customers now or include it in their cost thats why its important we talk to customers and give them as much as advance notice as possible

1112110 its about people dealing with all the curves the world throws accepting yourself

1112115 theyre all about helping you realize your creative vision theyre young theyre smart and theyre hungry they know what it means to put out a great book and they wont be satisfied with anything less
1112116 top cow is a company that is known for good art and great stories and to be partnered with them on berserker seemed like the right fit
1112117 we want to see people wearing berserker t shirts maybe carrying lunchboxes
1112118 until then we are looking to make a kick ass book
1112119 berserker is one of those unique properties which on the surface may seem familiar but quickly takes you on a series of unexpected twists and turns and grabbed our attention right away
1112120 rick loverds world of dark intense violence paired with rich characters grounded in the real world fits perfectly with top cow and of course were thrilled to have milo and russ at divide pictures as partners on this property as they bring an endless amount of enthusiasm and ideas to the table

1112136 allah has sent me as an apostle so that i may demonstrate perfection of character refinement of manners and loftiness of deportment
1112137 o people of quraish be prepared for the hereafter i cannot save you from the punishment of allah o bani abd manaf i cannot save you from allah o abbas son of abdul mutalib i cannot protect you either o fatima daughter of muhammad even you i cannot save
1112138 you did not think well of this man but you treated him so well
1112139 he is a bad person in the sight of allah who does not behave courteously and people shun his company because of his bad manners
1112140 let him who likes people to stand up in his honour he should seek a place in hell
1112141 he always joined in household work and would at times mend his clothes repair his shoes and sweep the floor he would milk tether and feed his animals and do the household shopping
1112142 o my son join not in worship others with allah for false worship is indeed the highest wrong doing
1112143 show gratitude to me and to thy parents to me is thy final goal
1112144 but if they strive to make thee join in worship with me things of which thou hast no knowledge obey them not yet bear them company in this life with justice and consideration and follow the way of those who turn to me in the end the return of you all is to me and i will tell you all that ye did
1112145 if there be but the weight of a mustard seed and it were hidden in a rock or anywhere in the heavens or on earth allah will bring it forth for allah is subtle and aware
1112146 o my son establish regular prayer enjoin what is just and forbid what is wrong and bear with patient constancy whatever betide thee for this is firmness of purpose in the conduct of affairs
1112147 and swell not thy cheek for pride at men nor walk in insolence through the earth for allah loveth not any arrogant boaster
1112148 and be moderate in thy pace and lower thy voice for the harshest of sounds without doubt is the braying of the ass
1112149 how could kids from such normal families do such things the parents were well off they lived in nice houses they had everything
1112150 what a stupid world things shouldnt have to be this way we could make it better if we only tried
1112151 but they are so normal how could such a tragedy have come from such a family
1112152 what a shame she had everything a child could want how could she have done that
1112153 my parents have injured my self esteem and society has frustrated me but if i can damage something anything then look how powerful i am
1112154 recurrent pattern of negativistic defiant disobedient and hostile behavior toward authority figures
1112155 thats ridiculous i would never kill innocent people like that
1112156 you have to admit that its a pretty remarkable thing for a man just to go to a hotel room door and open it and have a woman standing there and have sex with her
1112157 now you have absolutely no educational background in semiconductors do you mr bush
1112158 such as answering phone calls when jamal daniel the other co chairman called and asked for advice
1112159 im too busy being a good father and promoting ignite to worry about that kind of thing
1112160 i happened to be one of hundreds of other american businessmen and women who served as an outside director on the board of a savings and loan institution that failed during the 1980s
1112161 i regret that the institutions failure cost taxpayers so much money
1112162 theyd talk about how gw was going to run for governor of texas and jeb would run for governor of florida and neil would run for governor of colorado
1112163 the family would have bet on jeb but if you just observed their personalities youd say neil
1112164 hes relaxed hes funny hes a better speaker than anybody in the family he could easily have been a congressman
1112165 anyone who hires neil bush is going to get some heat
1112166 im trying to find a title for him if you want to know the truth
1112167 i probably have access to people who wouldnt meet with a development stage company
1112168 i was unable to attend their one and only board meeting
1112169 american dynasty aristocracy fortune and the politics of deceit in the house of bush
1112170 he seems to be crawling through the underbelly of crony capitalism

1112177 it reminded me of what my son uses but hes in kindergarten
1112178 you had to see the look on his face when one young woman got up and said she liked calculus he said it was useless this is the branch of mathematics that makes space travel possible and he said it was useless
1112179 very little sexual activity over the past 10 or 12 years
1112180 shes just great and she and neil are great together
1112181 this is a woman who has had some wonderful times with the bushes
1112182 but she has seen the dark side too and she intends to provide a view of the family that everyone will want to read
1112183 i learned a great deal about the bush family from sharon
1112184 she told me hes only offering 1 000 a month in support take it or leave it
1112185 had cause for believing that it could possibly be his neils child
1112186 she literally pulled his hair and yanked it out of his head he told me about it
1112187 well put up 850 000 and sharon bush can put up 850 000
1112188 and if shes right and neil bush is the father of that child she gets mr andrewss 850 000 and if were right we get her 850 000
1112189 hes a very happy guy and hes in a great relationship and he says this will all blow over
1112190 as his friend i just really enjoy seeing him so happy because for so many years he was not happy
1112191 neil and maria are incredibly affectionate with each other and with friends
1112192 its fun to watch them together because theyre so in love
1112193 in a time when we all are feeling the pinch of high energy and food costs its encouraging to know the american public realizes the benefits of soy biodiesel as a clean burning renewable homegrown fuel
1112194 the soybean checkoff believes its important that consumers understand the rising cost of petroleum represents the major reason for higher consumer food prices and that biodiesel represents a viable useful and beneficial alternative to imported oil
1112195 demand for soy biodiesel has very little impact on the price of food
1112196 a soybean consists mostly of protein rich meal and 98 percent of that meal is used to feed animals that produce food such as poultry pork beef and fish
1112197 a soybean checkoff study found that demand for biodiesel made from soybean oil increases the supply of soybean meal which will be largely used to produce more food not less
1112198 u s soybean farmers are estimated to have sown 74 5 million acres this year to help meet global food demand
1112199 illinois grain insurance fund protecting farmers if an elevator fails
1112200 this article may be of special interest to farmers in light of the failure of several illinois elevators during the past year
1112201 do not store grain worth more than 1 million at any one warehouse licensed by the illinois department of agriculture as the maximum recovery is 1 million per claimant
1112202 to assure 100 percent coverage for up to 1 million in sales of grain to a grain dealer always insist on being paid within 21 days of delivering and pricing the grain for sale
1112203 never let the unpaid value of such price later sales to any one licensee exceed 250 000
1112204 also understand the risks and benefits associated with farmer marketing programs or other higher risk services offered by licensees
1112205 farmers can take comfort in the fact that elevator failure is unlikely given stringent regulatory requirements of the illinois grain code and if a licensed elevator should fail farmers have the protections of the illinois grain insurance fund
1112206 the 2008 flood that wreaked havoc on midwestern farmland and contributed to an increase in grain prices compared to the fall of 2007 has left some grain farmers wondering what to do if they cannot deliver on forward contracts to sell grain entered into before their crops were lost
1112207 also some elevators may be wondering what would happen if an unscrupulous farmer who contracted to sell grain to the elevator when prices were lower were to ignore these contracts for future delivery and instead sell the grain on a higher spot market
1112208 in general a farmer whose crop was lost to the flood of 2008 should not breach a contract purchase substitute grain or enter into a settlement with a grain elevator without seeking legal advice
1112209 the best way to avoid a breach of contract lawsuit may be to negotiate a settlement with the elevator
1112210 alternatively a farmer could purchase grain from a third party to deliver to the elevator thereby fulfilling the farmers contract obligation
1112211 through such actions farmers may avoid litigation costs the elevators incidental costs of purchasing substitute grain and perhaps the elevators attorney fees that otherwise would be incurred
1112212 given the unusual level of uncertainty surrounding production prospects this year the report has the potential to produce a sharp price response
1112213 given the large price drop over the past three weeks the greater risk may be smaller than expected
1112214 for both corn and soybeans revenue insurance products now provide some important downside price protection for unpriced production
1112215 november 2008 soybean futures had declined below the spring price guarantee for revenue insurance products
1112216 for corn december 2008 futures are only about 30 cents above the spring price guarantee
1112217 the decline in prices over the past month reflects a number of shifting fundamentals including lower crude oil prices declining ethanol margins slowing corn exports increased wheat feeding and indications of some reduction in livestock production
1112218 the main contributor to the price decline however was improving crop condition ratings and the resultant larger production expectations
1112219 the crop condition ratings have been reported in the current form since 1986
1112220 from 1986 through 2007 there was a relatively high correlation between the percentage of the crop rated good or excellent at the end of the season and the u s average trend adjusted yield starting the trend calculation with 1986
1112221 crop conditions at the end of the season have explained 88 percent of the annual variation in the u s average trend adjusted corn yield and 85 percent of the annual variation in the u s average trend adjusted soybean yield
1112222 if the current crop condition ratings persist through the end of the season the 2008 u s average corn yield would be projected at 155 7 bushels per acre and the u s average soybean yield would be projected at 43 7 bushels per acre
1112223 still the lateness of the crops makes it very difficult to judge yield potential particularly for soybeans
1112224 for both crops weather conditions over the next two months will be extremely important for determining yield potential
1112225 a lot of yield uncertainty will persist after the august report
1112226 that information will be incorporated into the august production forecasts
1112227 like yield forecasts however the acreage forecasts are subject to revision as more information becomes available later in the season

1112298 after seeing dylan one more time i went back into the woods again making my way uphill to return to the tunnel creek aid station again
1112299 after almost tripping twice in the first mile this section is very rocky i decided to play it a bit safe and controlled
1112300 needles to say i am very happy with this result and a pretty sore and tired right now
1112301 i want to thank my family specifically my wife valerie for putting up with all my running and always encouraging me when i am down also a big thanks to my crew opa dylan alena also a big thank you to my coach karl king always the best advice
1112302 always the same for breakfast a piece of toast with butter and strawberry marmalade and a banana one hour before electrolyte caps with water then 15 prior a gu
1112303 a gu every 45 plus an electrolyte cap for fluid a hand held bottle every hour which is about 23 oz at mile 43 i also drank a de fizzed coke
1112304 an awesome day mid 70s at the bottom 40s at the top not much wind
1112305 a fast fast year its fun to be part of such a fast year i knocked 2 minutes off my pr with a 1 07 09 and it was good to meet other la sportiva and elite runners everyone is so kind
1112306 i had splits for a 10 24 and a 10 43 written on my arm
1112307 but i kept getting ahead of them especially on the climbs or when there was any hiking i would take major time off
1112308 ultrarunning may fit in with what i do ill always mainly be an adventure expedition hiker but there are some things i can learn from ur and apply them to fastpacking
1112309 congratulations to matt carpenter and naoko takahashi on their new course records matt ran the uphill 14 5 mile course in 1 37 01 to eclipse the 31 year old course record 1 41 35 set by john bramley in 1977 his pace was an amazing 6 42 per mile naoko the 2000 olympic gold medalist in the marathon and former marathon world record holder 2 19 46 finished in 2 06 22 nearly a minute faster than the previous record set by jne day lucore in 1990
1112310 i did a training run on the course i was surprised at how low angle it was before i knew it i had done a 6 00 minute mile
1112311 i had a really good race which i needed after vail
1112312 it was a fun day no wind clear blue sky i went out too fast as usual but came back and felt good
1112313 maybe shell crater above 12 000ft not anyway rest and back to training for all i suppose
1112314 one has to note that colorado men were 2 3 5 and colorado women were 1 3 boy that sounds like a
1112315 one has to note that 40 of the women in the top ten and 45 of the men in the top twenty were from new england
1112316 never engage in a statistical discussion with dd youll lose for sure
1112317 what a race at mt washington brandi did sooo well and absolutely kicked butt would have given anna a run for her money really missed not seeing anna there i was so excited to have broken the record set by joanie and running a pr by so much
1112318 i need to be the bernie beottcher of the women on the downhill then ok if i can just be almost like bernie on the downhill

1112347 mit den aktualisierten leitlinien tragen wir den wissenschaftlichen erkenntnissen der letzten jahre rechnung zahlreiche studien zeigen dass die kombination eines pap tests mit dem hpv test deutlich mehr sicherheit bietet frauen mit einem erh hten risiko f r geb rmutterhalskrebs zu identifizieren als der pap test allein
1112348 geb rmutterhalskrebs tritt bei frauen ab 30 jahren am h ufigsten auf durch den einsatz beider tests in dieser altersgruppe hoffen wir die anzahl der frauen die an geb rmutterhalskrebs erkranken oder sogar sterben deutlich reduzieren zu k nnen
1112349 im gegensatz zu anderen krebsarten kann geb rmutterhalskrebs praktisch zu 100 prozent verhindert werden wenn frauen und ihre rzte zugang zum hpv test und weiteren fortschritten der pr ventionsdiagnostik haben
1112350 die neuen leitlinien der deutschen gesellschaft f r gyn kologie und geburtshilfe spielen eine wichtige rolle dabei rzten und durch sie auch ihren patientinnen dabei zu helfen die effektivsten methoden zu verstehen mit denen diese krankheit ausgerottet werden kann qiagen bef rwortet die neuen leitlinien der dggg f r deutschland einem land mit 80 millionen einwohnern in dem das unternehmen stark vertreten ist
1112351 qiagen hat seinen wachstumskurs im zweiten quartal fortgesetzt zweites quartal 2008
1112352 das zweite quartal zeigte ein starkes umsatz und gewinnwachstum und wir konnten unsere strategische positionierung und unsere marktf hrerschaft weiter ausbauen wir haben 19 neue produkte im bereich probenvorbereitungs und testtechnologien sample amp assay technologies mit schwerpunkten in gen und proteinfunktionsanalyse in den markt eingef hrt im juni haben wir die ersten modelle unseres neuen flagschiffes die qiasymphony plattform ausgeliefert die im januar in den markt eingef hrt wurde und bereits enormes interesse bei unseren kunden aus allen bereichen hervorgerufen hat im juli konnten die noch wenigen verbliebenen projekte in zusammenhang mit der integration der digene dem management der entsprechenden abteilungen innerhalb der organisation bergeben werden damit ist die projektorganisation der digene integration entsprechend unseren zeitvorgaben und besser als erwartet hinsichtlich der realisierung von kostensynergien abgeschlossen
1112353 mit der akquisition der corbett life science im juli dieses jahres konnten wir unserer qiagen instrumentenplattform zwei weitere wichtige produkte hinzuf gen und unsere technologief hrerschaft im bereich der molekularen diagnostik weiter ausbauen beide produkte der rotor gene real time pcr cycler und das cas instrument f r die vorbereitung und das ansetzen molekularbiologischer tests k nnen mit qiagens probenvorbereitungs und testtechnologien sample amp assay technologies perfekt kombiniert werden zus tzlich l sst sich der rotor gene real time pcr cycler leicht in die qiasymphony plattform integrieren und vervollst ndigt so ein automationssystem das den gesamten arbeitsprozess von der probenvorbereitung bis zum ergebnis in allen bereichen von pcr basierenden analytischen tests abdeckt
1112354 wir sind sehr zufrieden mit dem finanzergebnis im zweiten quartal 2008 der umsatz lag innerhalb und der gewinn pro aktie lag ber unseren erwartungen f r dieses quartal das zweite quartal verzeichnete ebenfalls ein starkes wachstum in der bereinigten operativen marge auf 28 was einem operativen gewinnwachstum von 68 gegen ber dem vorjahresergebnis entspricht und die erzielten kostensynergien in zusammenhang mit der digene akquisition reflektiert

1112381 fui convidada para uma reuni o dos cat licos com representantes dos cultos africanos eu quero dizer que n o represento nenhum culto africano eu sou da religi o dos orix s t o religi o como as outras
1112382 eu sou padre f p roco da par quia n iniciado no terreiro de m e x
1112383 sou irm tal da congrega o tal iniciada no terreiro de m e z
1112384 eu vim para salvador com o objetivo de pesquisar sobre a religi o dos orix s senti logo que como pesquisador n o tinha condi es de entender quase nada foi ent o que me decidi a entrar para um terreiro como iniciado h quatro anos sou iniciado at hoje n o encontrei nada que fosse contra a minha f de crist o nada contr rio minha condi o de sacerdote
1112385 os sistema religiosos pr letrados t m natureza basicamente diversa da experi ncia vivida pelas grandes religi es universais entretanto em muitas religi es africanas encontram se freq entemente elaboradas constru es abstratas e intensa espiritualidade como se expressa na id ia de um deus incriado e criador
1112386 a no o de justi a divina por sua vez pressup e que exista uma esp cie de contrato firmado entre a divindade e os homens o ser criador assegura a vida a terra e tudo o que nela existe exigindo em troca submiss o e respeito assim determinados males s o entendidos como recursos com os quais a divindade castiga os homens que romperam de alguma forma sua parte no pacto prescri es ritual sticas religiosas configuram se como a nica maneira de alcan ar o benepl cito divino
1112387 a id ia de deus como causa primeira e ltima de todas as coisas o elemento comum important ssimo na vida espiritual da tradi o africana esse conceito percebido mais do que analisado vivido mais do que pensado exprime se de modo bastante variado de cultura a cultura na realidade a presen a de deus penetra a vida africana como a presen a de um ser superior pessoal e misterioso
1112388 o orix essencialmente orientado para o bem do homem portanto ele ama como n o acreditar num deus amor que cria e envia o orix
1112389 cresce assim a convic o de que deus acompanha todos os passos de seus filhos como m e
1112390 eu sou o deus de abra o o deus de isaac e o deus de jac ora ele n o um deus de mortos mas sim de vivos

1112403 lawvol is a complete and utter moron his mindless drivel is enough to make you want to bash your brains out

1112406 well he would have made a factual averment which could potentially be the subject of a defamation action

1112457 most important of all who would have ever been rash enough on september 12 2001 to say there would not be one major or even minor successful terrorist incident against the u s homeland in over five years who would have thought we would escape without more massive terror but we have and it is a foolhardy person who would say thats an accident bush may not have done it by himself but he had something to do with it my point lets be aware that bush has presided over a lot of success in addition to substantial failure my second point no one elected the media to anything if we let them lynch the man we elected as president we are throwing out the constitution with the war in iraq in the studios and newsrooms there is a lynch mob at work lets see it for what it is we have a good man who has made mistakes in the oval office hes the only president we have and i trust him a lot more than i trust unelected princes of the newsroom
1112458 perhaps the answer to all these questions can be found in this the sixth and seventh years of a presidency are the years when presidents discover their offices limits and their own all presidents end up trying to stretch too little sheet over too much bed we want them to be bold but not adventurous flexible but not vacillating resolute without stubbornness confident without cocksureness above all we want them to pursue great and uncertain goals and yet to achieve consistent success the men and women who seek the office believe themselves capable of all those things they have to or they would not dare and then they and we know great disappointment but that is not usually the end of the story the story ends much later on when partisan rancor cools when the results come in and the record can be read in full when that day at last arrives for this president perhaps all americans will be able to agree that this most divisive of figures united in himself both the first president bush and the second both the president who sometimes erred and stumbled and also the man who nonetheless kept fighting george w bush has always been at his best in adversity americans face no shortage of adversity now
1112459 the president asserted that no one wants failure in iraq understandably the commander in chief wanted to avoid conceding how very real a possibility failure is so he chose his rhetoric carefully he spoke in the abstract about the bipartisan desire for victory and success
1112460 despite all the hardships however we iraqis were able to raise the rudimentary pillars of our nascent democracy by writing a constitution electing a parliament based on that constitution and granting a vote of confidence to a government through that elected parliament it is not fair to look at iraq as a collection of failures without identifying its successes the birth of a new nation is not easy but just as your nation has become a beacon for democracy we hope that iraq will one day do the same all is not lost eliminating regional influence is the only way to bring iraqis back to their senses americans understandably find it difficult to support any strategy that prolongs the presence of your troops in iraq we do not want to stand in the way of your forces going home but that decision should not be made under the pressure of car bombs and kidnappings a precipitous withdrawal of forces would create a security vacuum in iraq that our forces cannot yet handle and would therefore be filled by extremists this does not serve the interests of iraq or the united states

1112650 we are delighted that leading has selected apama as a platform to offer algorithmic trading to its international clients this demonstrates that sell side securities firms are serious about meeting their customers complicated and diverse needs in a rapidly changing financial market
1112651 in line with the evolution of trading execution globally the responsibility of manual trade execution previously performed by our traders will wane and be replaced by continuous monitoring of our clients orders maintenance and updating of the algorithmic trading platform to meet their demands

1112728 there are a number of problems with these arguments first when federal waters or lands are leased to energy companies the first step is to explore for oil in other words look for it most of the acres leased for oil end up being determined to not hold enough oil or gas to make it profitable for energy companies to actually extract it so the vast majority of those 68 million acres are not being used for a simple reason theyre currently unusable

1112733 i would say respectfully that i thought in this speech that there was a disconnect between things senator obama said today in particularly with regards to iran and things that he has said or done earlier either in the campaign and senate to be specific i was troubled earlier in the year during the campaign season when senator obama referred to i guess compared iran and other rogue and terrorists states to the soviet union and minimized the threat represented by iran i think that is wrong
1112734 senator obama opposed it saying it was saber rattling and referring to the possible threat of military force
1112735 but if you look at the kyl liebermann amendment as it was passed it has none of that in it regarding military action i was hoping and i still hope that he will say that that vote was a mistake and that he would support that resolution
1112736 obama today argued that american foreign policy in recent years has essentially sort of strengthened iran
1112737 at one point he almost seems to suggest that it helped to elect us ahmadinejad and has made israel safe i just disagree with that iran elected ahmadinejad for their own reasons if israel is in danger today its not because of american foreign policy which has been strongly supportive of israel in every way it is not because what we have done in iraq it is because iran is a fanatical terrorist expansionist state and has a leader and a leadership that constantly threatens to extinguish the state of israel

1113030 it is shameful that congress recessed for five weeks left for five weeks the american people are having a difficult time making ends meet my constituents say they have too much month left at the end of their money i agree with them congress needs to come back in democratic leaders need to address this issue

1113032 all the president can do is call congress back in if congress comes back in and the speaker gavels congress closed immediately upon gaveling it in just like they did last friday then nothing is solved this takes leadership on the part of the speaker of the house of representatives and were asking her to fill the void of leadership right now

1113065 since they as well as many other professors and graduate students were signing the protest document i went along and did so also
1113066 in 1975 for personal reasons not related to any doubts or questions about the faith or the church or the religious life i requested and obtained a dispensation from pope paul vi returning me to the lay state later i was married in the church and raised my two children in the faith i have had many conversations with my pastor and with his assistant who is my spiritual director about my days as a franciscan priest and have been active in many of our parishs lay apostolate and ministries
1113067 but i have always regretted having signed the protest document against pope pauls teaching in 1968 and having learned a few years ago that fr faricy had publicly repudiated signing the protest i had wished that i too could repudiate in some official way having signed the protest and so your pledge document offers me an opportunity to correct my mistake and find healing and telling you about all this helps me to feel that my repudiation of the protest is now known and accepted in a kind of semi official sort of way by an authority in the church
1113068 and thank you for reading this thereby humoring an old man who despite everything else knows that he is a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
1113069 in christs kingdom it is never too late even after forty years to fully embrace the truth all of us make mistakes and all of us sin but he gives us all a chance to be reconciled with him and turn our sorrow into joy

1113079 we know an information campaign is not the ultimate panacea but the realities of illegal migration are there for everyone to see its important that potential migrants understand that they risk losing their life and all their money everything that a family or village has saved up for them
1113080 its too hard here there are young people who get married have families but there is nothing for them to do
1113081 we are going to target these smugglers who are like a mafia gang they are people who dont care about taking money from innocent young people we will do everything to block the work of these people
1113082 we are just beginning our work but we will have a system that goes right back to the migrants villages

1113089 after defensive shield two boats went down to the area of sudaniya in the northern gaza strip
1113090 we spotted a patrol on the shore going to the beach outside our target area on the beach itself
1113091 when naval task force 13 signaled that they saw weapons at the site all of us on the boat felt very excited
1113092 another incident occurred in the southern area of khan yunis
1113093 it is highly probably that on the beach there was a child of 12 who was waiting with the narghile for his big brother to come back from guard duty a person like that is not a legitimate target

1113103 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1113104 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1113105 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1113106 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence
1113107 also parental nurturance may help girls cope with challenges associated with early puberty by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression
1113108 by discussing difficult peer situations e g provocation peer pressure and ways of dealing with them parents may help their daughters develop a repertoire of adaptive responses that will minimize the need for inappropriate i e aggressive behavior
1113109 in addition knowing how their daughters spend free time may help parents identify and prevent negative peer and other influences

1113225 the thought a while back was that demand was going to hold up pretty well in the face of higher prices but it finally hit a wall
1113226 it forces prices to overshoot on the upside but it also forces prices to overshoot on the downside
1113227 were probably going to see prices drop much further than people anticipate
1113228 gasoline didnt rise as fast as oil on the way up so i wouldnt expect that it would fall as much on the way back down

1113235 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
1113236 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it

1113249 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1113250 hyper v performed reasonably well in my lab tests especially once i installed the hyper v integration services following a virtual machine vm guest os installation prior to installing the integration services routine tasks like formatting a hard disk took considerably longer than im used to in virtual environments for example formatting a 40gb virtual hard disk took about four minutes to complete a similar task in the same environment with vmware esx server 3 5 took about four seconds
1113251 most notably lacking from bag of tricks are live migration and memory over commit support live migration such as that found in vmotion and xenmotion lets you move a vm from one physical host to another in the same physical cluster without having to take a vm offline this has changed the quality of life for many it folks because they can now perform routine hardware maintenance tasks during normal business hours in the middle of the week instead of at some obscure hour over the weekend once you have live migration you find yourself wondering how you ever got by without it
1113252 memory over commit is another core feature that hyper v will desperately need in order to compete with the likes of vmware inc basically with memory over commit the amount of memory allocated to all vms on a given physical host can exceed the amount of physical memory on the host this is important because vms rarely need all of their physical memory at the same time
1113253 one missing option is the ability to connect any type of network monitor such as an intrusion detection system to a hyper v virtual switch in order to do this you need to be able to configure a one way mirror in the virtual switch allowing one switch port to see the traffic of all other ports on the virtual switch this level of integration is very easy to configure on both vmware esx and citrix xenserver
1113254 hyper v cant bind to all teamed nic drivers so its important to validate teaming and hyper v support with the nic vendor before making a purchasing decision ideally id love to see the day when microsoft offers nic teaming as part of the os or hyper v configuration something thats unsupported today
1113255 like kung fu virtualization takes years to master hyper v may look like a cute cuddly panda today but i have no doubt that within a few years the panda will fully morph into a tiger

1113301 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1113302 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out
1113303 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together
1113304 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice
1113305 i couldnt bear the thought of getting more things to dust in our home
1113306 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1113307 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1113308 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money
1113309 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware
1113310 so we thought wed have people who want to celebrate with a gift do that with these two institutions
1113311 i know you have a great deal of freedom to hunt
1113312 he said that one of the reasons he needed to fence off his property was that when he was living in switzerland
1113313 he was interrupted so much he couldnt get any work done
1113314 hed always been a fairly enigmatic person and him making a public appearance to the local townspeople that went a long way with the folks in town
1113315 when the news media found out he was in cavendish they just descended on the town to find out everything they could people wouldnt tell them anything
1113316 no matter how late it was he seemed to be working
1113317 our children grew up and went to school here alongside your children
1113318 indeed our whole family has felt at home among you exile is always difficult and yet i could not imagine a better place to live and wait and wait for my return home than cavendish vermont
1113319 steve has the temperament and the experience to help the washington bureau retain its reputation for being first and fair while taking us to a new level in enterprise and watchdog journalism
1113320 i wish everybody would be treated like we treat people
1113321 these are simple people they are a family of butchers
1113322 they blame the media they blame us they refuse to accept responsibility for anything that is going on in that plant
1113323 we are god fearing people and we believe in the american system and we believe it will ultimately turn out ok
1113324 there are people who would like to see us leave but on the whole we have very warm relations
1113325 we werent talking about cursory stuff what kind of clothes to wear we were talking trial strategy
1113326 theres no question that these calls are privileged and we rely on that because the criminal justice system would come to a screeching halt if we had to drive to the jail every time we had to talk to our clients
1113327 anyone could call and ask that their numbers be added to the database but the problem was that we didnt do as much as we could have in publicizing this fact
1113328 the first thing you hear when you pick up the phone is that your call can be recorded
1113329 if you didnt register your phone number with the list then you didnt do your job the onus is on you
1113330 offered oses sincere appreciation for ises understanding in the matter

1113332 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1113333 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1113334 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1113335 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1113336 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1113337 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
1113338 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
1113339 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
1113340 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1113341 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1113342 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1113343 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1113344 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1113345 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1113346 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1113347 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1113348 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1113349 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1113350 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1113351 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1113352 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1113353 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 meters 26 000 feet due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was
1113354 my hands are fine while my feet are black from frostbite anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1113355 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1113356 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1113357 i would love it if everyone could contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers they put me through the wringer but its so beautiful the night will be long but beautiful
1113358 this years conference broadens its scope to cover the breadth of game research and education the conference is targeted at researchers making contributions that promote new game capabilities designs applications and modes of play artificial intelligence we solicit papers on artificial intelligence research that provides novel solutions to traditional game ai problems e g path planning camera control terrain analysis user modeling tactical strategic decision making etc supports novel game concepts or gameplay elements e g interactive drama narrative character development npc belief attitude emotion modeling etc provides automated or semi automated solutions to game production challenges e g game design content creation testing prodcedural animation etc or describes the integration of ai technologies e g machine learning logical inference planning etc into game ai architectures
1113359 too human will have cut scenes but i think that weve managed to blur the line between what people would consider a cut scene and what people consider in game see part of the reason we as designers want to use cut scenes is because it allows us to be cinematographers and thats fine but in game too human will use a dynamic intelligent camera system that presents the in game in a more cinematic light at the same time being conducive to good gameplay
1113360 jm what do you think about i have this theory that okay so a lot of modern games now have set piece gaming you know like heavenly sword or something scripted events happen so my theory is that you can have scripted events but you inject some sort of randomness and then every time you play that scripted event again its always new so thats i dont know have you ever thought of creating sort of randomized scripted events cause i notice all your games are completely random kc i think randomness is very important especially since i write all the games by myself and i test play my games continuously i like randomness also because the developer cant know how my game the behavior of the game changes dynamically every time jm thats good because i really like random but have you thought of a scripted event that is random you know what i mean so like on the last level its like there were those spinning things and they go away and the boss comes but its still random what do you think about that kc i tend to write the pattern or script in my games myself so i try to have minimum sets of script in the minimum sets of algorithm in my game and another sequence generated from my program also im not good at writing scripts or events in my games so i try to write simple games with random dynamic patterns but also can be enjoyed by the player those kinds of random sequences
1113361 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1113362 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1113363 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1113364 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1113365 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1113366 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out
1113367 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together
1113368 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice

1113373 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware
1113374 so we thought wed have people who want to celebrate with a gift do that with these two institutions
1113375 the very fact that we can get married to some people is a political act
1113376 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1113377 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1113378 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1113379 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1113380 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1113381 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1113382 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1113383 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad
1113384 that just highlights how important it is to intervene early and set healthy lifestyle patterns early on
1113385 we have made some concessions including agreeing to postpone the elections and we have shown flexibility on this
1113386 we want to see the final version of the u n proposal we want to make sure that there is no reference to the referendum in it
1113387 have not shown any flexibility and they are not interested in reaching any deals
1113388 currently the testing is done manually by people but they may get tired and overlook something or be too involved in playing the game to see everything therefore an automated testing approach is very beneficial to a games company
1113389 see he threw the car door open because it was the smartest way to take cover
1113390 with the significant amount of ai material available on websites such as this one solo books and compilations such as the
1113391 whether he intentionally implied it or not the take away i get from this is that as far as ai related education goes youre on your own to be honest thats not far from the truth anyway take it where you can get it talk network attend browse post respond visit aigamedev daily buy plenty of books from alexs links after all while ai knowledge and experience may not grow on trees knowledge of ai trees and other stuff can be found in plenty of places
1113392 i was hoping there would be more to it than
1113393 i was hoping that by the end of that long paper there would be more to it than we can use influence maps to determine the enemys flank gee ya think
1113394 i cant say its been as useful as i would have hoped but i did pull a few papers particularly on animation recently that were really insightful
1113395 one of the problems facing game ai at the moment is that a lot of the content is not published in a peer reviewed format and it is left to communities such as this one to communicate within themselves as to the quality of this content again though you cant cover everything in a small community but you hope that as you grow so too does your coverage and understanding there are now several new journals dedicated to game applications of ai and we need to encourage more people working in this field to publish in them this will strengthen both the credibility of the field assuming good content and the base of knowledge from which we can all draw to extend and advance the field in the years ahead
1113396 i might also point out that aigpw is peer reviewed at least in a limited fashion not only is it edited much more extensively than you average journal but we also have every paper read by at least two other authors while this isnt as strong a factor in the accept reject decision as it is for conferences it is possible for a paper to be dropped if we really feel like theres nothing there and it also tends to result in a more readable and focussed result one of the problems with the peer review system as it exists in academia is that it tends to be a simple accept or reject granted with comments rather than working with the author to take what they have and make it better
1113397 figlia perch balli da sola sulla pista deserta di questa notte mancata in mezzo a uomini gi spariti e sospiri immaginari che tempo conta il tuo cuore malato di lentezza e presunzione per arrivare sempre allora inutile non spettaranno ancora il tuo splendore e la mia fierezza morir di stenti sia clemente il castigo per tanto spreco
1113398 we have agreed that we will not allow terrorism to stand in our way
1113399 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1113400 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1113401 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1113402 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1113403 one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1113404 entire thorny path of his life will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1113405 while solzhenitsyn accepted putinism the writer always remained the man who embodied openness criticism of the powers that be the powers that putin all his life served
1113406 look around you this is not a country where people cower in fear
1113407 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1113408 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1113409 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1113410 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1113411 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the olympics greatly
1113412 the threat from east turkestan forces exist but their capabilities are limited
1113413 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1113414 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1113415 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1113417 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1113418 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1113419 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap
1113420 this moment represents an unprecedented step towards the normalization of the political life of the country and will improve the democratic state
1113421 from now on legislative elections will be held regularly with periodic renewals every four years in accordance with the constitution
1113422 i appeal to all citizens and political parties to keep a responsible attitude and to respect the law and order so that the electoral campaign is carried out peacefully
1113423 angola can be an example to the african continent and to the world in general on how to hold democratic free and transparent elections
1113424 this is not an end of the season fun race for us this is a serious objective for our team its a major event
1113425 athletes from around the world will come to race in missouri
1113426 last year they experienced great weather great crowds and were welcomed by big and small cities alike we look forward to playing host to them all again in september
1113427 without doubt this is a deeper field than last year
1113428 we have three teams that played major roles at the tour de france this year we have all the top clubs in north america and two top european continental teams that will surely be hungry it is an interesting and talented mix
1113429 the way the course is designed it will take a very high caliber athlete to win we could see a few more lead changes than last year with three top teams from the tour de france and all the top teams in north america there will be a lot of good wheels to follow
1113430 this event proved in only its first year to be hugely successful for all involved most importantly the great host communities of the tour
1113431 it was very successful for the state as a tourism vehicle as people from 73 countries caught part of the event via live webcasts and people from 21 states came into missouri to see the event
1113432 i cant remember missing any practices in the seven years ive been here in camp and even during the season so it was a lot different for me to be over here and just working out and not being with the guys on the field i was happy to get back out for sure
1113433 ill let my people and them handle that so im just working on getting back on the field
1113434 they are all intelligent guys and they are all guys that can do different things
1113435 we have the ability to run two and three tight ends
1113436 its a really good group of guys weve got guys that can bring different things to the offense i think its going to be a lot of fun
1113437 im fortunate that this is my third year into the offense and weve added a few wrinkles but ive been through that process the last two years so i feel real good with the offense
1113438 were excited just trying to expand some of the things i can do for the team
1113439 it was an injury that i could easily have taken three weeks off but you guys know how i am i didnt believe it that he said
1113440 he had a pretty serious ankle injury and he fought through it worked through it its tough when you get banged up early and the train doesnt stop youve got to keep going its something he handled really well
1113441 the genre remains distinctively british even when transposed to distant lands and earlier times
1113442 he twin attitudes that gave rise to the victorian detective faith in reason and mistrust of appearances flourish today as never before science in the form of dna testing guides criminal detection more surely than anything holmes and his magnifying glass could have achieved but we are even more obsessed than the victorians with the notion that surface respectability conceals evil detective fiction and its echo in our obsession with real life murder reflects the best and worst in us at best a belief that science and reason will triumph and that inside each of us is a philip marlowe untainted by corruption down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean who is neither tarnished nor afraid at worst a curtain twitching voyeurism an ingrained suspicion that the sweetest smile hides the blackest heart

1113460 our goal is to create a situation where should steve decide to run there will be a grass roots and finance organization already in place to secure him the republican nomination
1113461 steve lonegans conservative leadership is the reason he is the republican partys premier leader when so many other leaders have been asleep at the wheel
1113462 no one in new jersey has the record of accomplishment steve lonegan has built from stopping mcgreeveys gasoline tax hike to defeating two ballot questions last november and the corzine borrowing and toll hike scheme last spring
1113463 steve lonegans fight against state debt is legendary and his leadership in taking on the corzine 3 9 billion bond boondoggle and the new corzine coah low income housing regulations are just more reasons why he is the man for the job
1113464 as mayor he virtually froze municipal spending and debt during his twelve years in office and kept municipal taxes far below the inflation rate
1113465 in the time steve froze municipal spending the states budget literally doubled thats a fact
1113466 new jersey republicans continue to lose election after election because we run the same old gang of weak kneed wimpy moderates who believe in nothing and are afraid to throw a punch
1113467 steve lonegan is the antithesis of the losing republican he knows how to play the game neither the democrats nor corzines money intimidates him to steve defeat is not an option and that resonates with the millions of overtaxed new jersey voters ready to give up on our state but ready to give our state one more chance

1113687 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1113688 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1113689 by the looks of it phil has either accidentally or purposefully swallowed these while playing the drinking game
1113690 thats nothing take a look at all the coal located in the intestines that phil swallowed over the years
1113691 yes phil believed that by swallowing the coal he could later produce diamonds
1113692 well we havent seen any diamonds yet wait were approaching the entry way to the colon whats that
1113693 this way out this way out stay out of the colon this way oouuut
1113694 im not sure he seems to be issuing some kind of warning trying to direct us elsewhere ignore him and remind me to kill it later
1113695 even if it seems certain that you will lose retaliate neither wisdom nor technique has a place in this a true man does not think of victory or defeat he plunges recklessly toward an irrational death
1113696 it brings about a great forum of questioning when is it best to use the model who benefits
1113697 and the answers are always and the playaz the answers are always the same
1113698 by my observations it was a giant tapeworm that has been living in phils colon
1113699 no doubt from phils journey to where he must have eaten at kenny amp bons and ordered the side dish of tapeworms who knew they could be parasitic certainly no one at the fda or board of health notified me of anything plus theyre pretty lax in other continents ive come to find out
1113700 great shot tac and great work playaz im sure phil is feeling better already
1113701 all systems are go we have entered phils bloodstream and have maneuvered our way into the esophagus by being shrunk to microscopic size well be able to explore phil and hopefully be able to cure him
1113702 phil has not fully recovered from his previous health issues
1113703 thats right ever since phil left playaz ball 2007 to seek out mysterious absence and headed for the african coast we dont know what illness befell him
1113704 no time to explain now look we are approaching phils heart
1113705 dear god it appears to be coated in melted cheese
1113706 ah yes i believe we will find cheese coursing through phils veins like a magic congealed bond that holds the very strands of life together
1113707 hold on playaz it appears we are getting close to the stomach i understand kenny is able to view us through their monitors
1113708 no apparently he consumes them whole his teeth have lost all of their enamel over time and i believe he is incapable of chewing most foods
1113709 salt mixed with cocaine phils love of all things salted combined with copious useage of cocaine have created these pillars as the two collected within his stomach
1113710 come playaz we have a long journey ahead let us partake in this salt cocaine pillar to give us energy
1113711 heh heh playaz heh i mean ive got an addiction heh to oil heh heh and i mean it needs to get fed you know
1113712 i fear you are one of those desert loving english orrance
1113713 did they have faces did they have hands yes then it wasnt us
1113714 men usually think theyre the boss but us women know very well its not true
1113715 its supposed to make people think about the true role of women
1113716 re enactments are entertainment but they also teach people about the past and present
1113717 in this group you dont compete to be slim you have to gain weight to qualify
1113718 if you havent got the weight to start with you can always add it as you go along
1113719 there was a deep roaring sound like a bomb raid
1113720 my wife was watching television then suddenly my daughter cried out my shutters exploded and part of our roof flew off
1113721 the windows of my apartment suddenly blew up i lay down on the ground i just thought i was going to die
1113722 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
1113723 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise us interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
1113724 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice
1113725 instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own record a fatal mistake if we do not correct it
1113726 i am passing this message to gb gordon brown not in these terms and will try to help but at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
1113727 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
1113728 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
1113729 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
1113730 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
1113731 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
1113732 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
1113733 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
1113734 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
1113735 there will be a telephone call today between jalili and solana
1113736 negotiations are an ongoing process and the question of deadline is media speculation
1113737 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
1113738 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
1113739 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
1113740 we are serious in talks and we want the talks to be based on the law so it will bear practical results we hope that other sides are serious too
1113741 it will be a night of the unexpected people would be entertained to the maximum but they should not also forget to donate generously to the change charity even though the night is gonna be about me we should also remember our young ones who are less privileged in society
1113742 we should be aware that the credit crisis is not behind us yet
1113743 i consider it crucial to strengthen the communication with our stakeholders and will update the market in full transparency on progress made
1113744 i have no idea whether that portfolio that merrill lynch is selling is of comparable quality to ours i would tend to believe that ours is of a higher quality
1113745 we expect full year 2008 organic revenue growth to exceed the 3 0 to 4 0 goal in our long term business model
1113746 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1113747 the area that is causing some concern is that although its asian growth is good it is slower than it was and if you extrapolate from that then growth is going to be really slow
1113748 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1113749 os dois est o sendo perseguidos pelo arbitragem o valdivia recebeu um cart o por uma falta que ele sequer cometeu j o caso do kl ber mais s rio pois est provado que a persegui o vem acontecendo seguidamente est na hora de acontecer uma reuni o pois os rbitros precisam ter crit rio e serem instru dos por quem comanda a arbitragem brasileira
1113750 we will use more than 30 kinds of flowers and some of them can last for four months
1113751 since the 36 kinds of flowers available in the shop are specially cultivated for the olympics their price will not be very cheap
1113752 nineteen powerhouse eastern bloc countries stayed home in 1984 paving the way for american carl lewis to dominate in athletics
1113753 youtube to stream olympics to 77 territories all banks failed second great depression started ron paul elected president apple only company to survive
1113754 given that davenport used his position as part of the relevant air force office to get his peers to use his software the case fails this test but the court also addressed the dmca claims made by blueport and its decision here is quite striking
1113755 the united states as a sovereign is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued

1113775 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1113776 are there massive volumes of information massive volumes of information
1113777 that guy who got drunk in health sciences for that poster
1113778 i chose not to choose trinity i chose something else and the reasons what reasons who needs reasons when youve got ucd
1113779 wir sind hocherfreut dass addax petroleum chrome und kogas dieses projekt nach massgabe der richtlinien f r gas und des gas masterplans unseres landes initiiert haben das stellt einen wichtigen schritt vorw rts f r die entwicklung von nigerias bedeutenden gasressourcen und f r die laufende wirtschaftsentwicklung des landes dar die kombination der heimischen und internationalen interessen in dem konsortium und die beteiligung der regierung des bundesstaates bayelsa zeigen die zuversicht der beteiligten in bezug auf unseren plan und auf die gl nzende zukunft nigerias

1113781 only the gop would think that keeping your machine at peak efficiency is a bad thing
1113782 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1113783 early estimates from gm staff were of initial annual production of 60 000 units 8 but these claims have been scaled back to a planned 10 000 units as of may 2008 9 with a ramp up to 60 000 units in the second year 10
1113784 lets reduce electricity consumption 15 by switching from gas to electric cars
1113785 lets reduce electricity consumption 15 by switching from gas to electric cars
1113786 only the gop would think that keeping your machine at peak efficiency is a bad thing
1113787 inflating your tires will save as much oil as drilling in alaska and offshore would produce
1113788 mccains campaign quickly pointed out that that is also a reversal for obama
1113789 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea 28 days ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1113790 while the candidate sketches the big picture on energy obama spokesperson linda douglass told the huffington post that his campaign isnt especially concerned about the gops tire taunts noting that obamas original comment came in response to a town hall questioner
1113791 its fascinating that every time a consumer asks a question about what he can do while waiting for washington to act which it never does republicans mock the idea
1113792 has a core group of fans that will pay whatever we charge
1113793 in their last moments they are stabbing at the very heart of music
1113794 file sharing by definition is not profitable its redistributing without paying to do so
1113795 but most bands need income from a couple sources that includes cd sales
1113796 why should musicians give up a large portion of income because people are too cheap to pay
1113797 oh its no problem ill just live from gig to gig

1113803 repeatedly points out that has a funny name and then accuses mccain of using that against him at some point in the future
1113804 when has the word elite become bad the president should be elite it is the only job in the world where if you do well they carve your face into a mountain
1113805 have nothing relevant to say so i will call you a troll insult you or just digg
1113806 obama traitor to american principles votes for fisa and telecom immunity
1113807 theres an interesting line building on obama that somehow success and intelligence are a handicap
1113808 be taken out to the woodshed for that utter stupidity
1113809 raising taxes to curtail our economy forcing americans to pay high prices at the pump instead of utilizing the rest of our petroleum reserves
1113810 he has done more damage to america in his lifetime than you could ever hope to do in two or three
1113811 throughout our history the words of the declaration have inspired immigrants from around the world to set sail to our shores these immigrants have helped transform 13 small colonies into a great and growing nation of more than 300 people
1113812 i also make more money in month than you do in a year so im not being held down
1113813 your language makes it clear how you view black people and to find you also also oppose an mlk holiday
1113814 apparently you missed my comments about not voting for president this year i cant stomach either of them in office
1113815 its fine to be arrogant narcissistic and conceited provided youre white
1113816 no i cant eat those vegetables because that tomato is too good for my health
1113817 the candidates crowning demonstrations of hubris according to those building a case came during his extended trip to iraq afghanistan the middle east and europe recall the pundits demanding the freshman illinois senator prove he could be presidential in the foreign arena so he appeared at ease with world leaders talked animatedly with beaming american troops and drew huge civilian crowds then the pundits who had been taking a round of bashing for supposedly going easy on obama told obama he needed to beware of appearing too presidential
1113818 i have a four year old nephew whos probably going to think im the greatest thing ever now im getting to wear armour and have fangs
1113819 hayden gave milo an unforgettable birthday surprise by morphing from her
1113820 it was fun for like 20 minutes but the next day i just didnt feel good about myself
1113821 its a dirty drug i find people who do coke to be very shady that theyre doing it makes them lie about things i wouldnt want to date someone whos into it
1113822 but id say that when the strike came and stopped private practice after only nine episodes it was like a mad roller coaster ride when the train suddenly stops it was disorienting
1113823 im passionately convinced hes the best person to be the next president
1113824 and thats not because his wife is a huge greys fan
1113825 but id say that when the strike came and stopped private practice after only nine episodes it was like a mad roller coaster ride when the train suddenly stops it was disorienting
1113826 hayden gave milo an unforgettable birthday surprise by morphing from her
1113827 it was fun for like 20 minutes but the next day i just didnt feel good about myself

1113829 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery
1113830 on the other hand the u s has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material
1113831 the more ive seen the more critical i see the need is for the world to pay attention to the people of burma and for the world to put pressure on the military regime
1113832 i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them
1113833 he will have to say something public which is always tricky how much he spotlights these issues
1113834 and i think he will not do it in an adversarial way
1113835 hey how bout we skip the selling to latin america buying from europe step and just sell it to me oh thatll cut into your percentage well we cant have that now can we i mean the important thing is that you guys remain the most profitable business in history cant let anything interfere with that
1113836 in the heart of steamy india the hidden longings of a saffron picker for the lady of the plantation theirs is a forbidden romance that can only end in passion and tears
1113837 the reception we received in new york was amazing we gave phones to new yorks finest from governor david paterson to security guards at the game baseballs greatest athletes and their families enjoyed our phone and what it actually offers our targeted demographic was new york city and their incredible citizens yankee fans are the most loyal and outspoken fans in the world they understood that the value and quality of the phone is not disposable the hop1800 has clear sound technology components including a flashlight and design comparable to any mid tier cell phone on the market for a fraction of the cost their embrace of our phone was truly incredible
1113838 the best chance weve learned is with a different city and given that were talking 20 to 30 years before we could do it again i think a lot will come down to how brisbane develops in terms of further infrastructure hotels and whatever by then
1113839 my view is that this is something brisbane should throw its hat in the ring for
1113840 it is a 10 15 years thing and something we would have to work through
1113841 i almost didnt put him here in part because of his whining during the finals

1113847 i found it hard to explain to anyone how only 45 republicans vote for that bill
1113848 dealing with people who dont want to give health care to poor little children in america
1113849 its a contemporary retelling of the timeless tale of david and goliath
1113850 weve gotten sort of rid of almost all the signs of pop culture from the world
1113851 a very sort of simple way to think of it is that the show takes place absolutely today in a country which you havent heard of and any of the things available to us are available in the world that the show takes place in
1113852 so its this world its just not a country we know
1113853 its a parallel universe its this world existing on a different trajectory
1113854 its kind of a multicultural event which i see as a way to build community
1113855 it brings together people who would not otherwise know each other
1113856 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
1113857 there have been big corporate drives for indigenous employment in the past but weve stopped short of guaranteeing the job
1113858 actually i didnt do the killing my family killed them they disapproved of my lifestyle they killed every man who was close to me
1113859 i cant talk now i just want to protect them
1113860 tien had beaten his son many times before he forced him to drink rice wine which caused the boys death on july 22
1113861 tiens wife used to be a prostitute so he thought the boy was not his son and he beat the boy every now and then

1113863 the law here is the law of the tribes the rule of the tribes is stronger than that of baghdad
1113864 the rule of the tribes is stronger than that of baghdad
1113865 we are ready to respect the law of baghdad but the government has to represent the people
1113866 i started shooting in the air and throughout the town bursts of gunfire echoed across the sky my family understood that the time had come and we started the war against al qaeda
1113867 with their help we were able to liberate al qaim
1113868 my concern is that if both the peking organization and the taipei organization insist on being considered the only governing body for all china the majority view is likely to support peking simply because of the huge difference in population between the mainland and taiwan
1113869 on the other hand if your association can accept the change of name to taiwan there will be widespread support for your association as the only effective governing body in the territory of taiwan a refusal to change is likely to be interpreted as a refusal to accept a limitation of your jurisdiction to the island of taiwan many member federations of the iaaf find it difficult to understand the reluctance to affiliate as taiwan when the name taiwan is so widely used in promoting and identifying trade products under the name taiwan there can be no doubt or confusion and you have a clear right to continue in iaaf membership
1113870 the constitution of the republic of china olympic committee 1973 has also been studied
1113871 it appears that whilst the olympic committee in taipei does not claim jurisdiction in any other area other than the surrounding islands this article infers that it would move its seat with the taipei government which unlike the olympic committee there claims to be the government of china
1113872 it would be natural for hsbc to try to renegotiate the price given the market conditions
1113873 as much as hsbc is determined to buy keb its also true that the current price is too high
1113874 we dont lose anything by being patient to get the deal done

1113882 our communities have grown and we are spread out technology has discounted the need for a well to draw our water however it is still possible for us to meet at the well in true titus 2 form it has just now become a virtual well
1113883 for who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the mans spirit within him in the same way no one knows the thoughts of god except the spirit of god we have not received the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from god that we may understand what god has freely given us
1113884 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age

1113887 we have suspected for a long time that these virulence proteins had some way of slipping inside plant cells to suppress immunity our findings finally nail down that mechanism and enable us to focus on how to block the entry mechanism
1113888 the finding that virulence proteins from oomycetes and the malaria parasite plasmodium use the same entry mechanism means that we may be able to use the same or similar drugs to block infection by both groups of pathogens this type of approach may also be relevant to other groups of pathogens such as fungi which we also suspect of slipping virulence proteins into host cells
1113889 the double barreled gene gun enabled us to make much more accurate measurements of the avr1b protein than were previously possible which made it practicable to measure the action of the rxlr and deer motifs

1113944 the results of the 2007 survey really helped to move our portal project forward
1113945 the 2007 report has greatly helped and influenced the direction of our intranet
1113946 shining light on the often hidden world of intranets the global intranets survey is sure to become the standard reference for all intranet teams
1113947 the quality of this superlative report makes it a valuable reference for building your intranet business case
1113948 same tool clear policies user training then let the people go
1113949 how do they manage the risk of the intranet failing
1113950 people may be concerned but not reporting it as a concern because they may have mitigated the risk already i dont recall how i answered this question but id say im not terribly concerned although i agree its very important we have multiple data centres in different locations with automatic failover daily backups going back years full audit logs etc the risk has been mitigated
1113951 external social networking concerns are fairly low on the list
1113952 we separate responsibilities for internal and external communications therefore while i may have a professional interest in external social networking its not a relevant topic for me in my role i bet the same is true for many intranet managers
1113953 related to governance id be interested to learn about what kind of intranet publishing models distributed hybrid centralized other other organizations employ as well as how they maintain the quality and consistency of the intranet content audits standards etc
1113954 how do we ensure that all content has an owner and how do we engage those content owners to keep their content up to date this is certainly an issue with us
1113955 a key pressure for me is getting business buy in funding and ensuring people arent working on their own
1113956 i would like to learn whether large organizations have in place programs or mechanisms by which to improve the overall quality of their intranet distributed authorship has taken off with content management systems what are organizations doing to equip these part time webmasters with the skills they need to create effective online communications who has editorial oversight for the whole intranet does this person or group have the authority needed to enforce standards do organizations even have standards if yes what format do they take and what sort of success have organizations seen with their standards programs
1113957 what are the top skills required what are the barriers to entering leaving the industry what type of people are best suited to being intranet managers
1113958 we also wonder about the degree one should customize the intranet how many roles are good to handle and make sense does it work to let the author decide who is the target group of his information or should their be represantatives of the target group who decide and after all how much personalization makes sense you often read that most employees dont personalize their homepage is it worth the effort for the intranet team
1113959 on one hand people are requesting web 2 0 features and on the other hand it is very difficult to get people away from e mail and shared drives
1113960 regarding social networking what is the general attitude of organisations to the use of social networking by employees on company time my company blocks all social networking sites and i am interested to know if employees who are allowed to access these sites abuse the privilege
1113961 youve indicated that you might focus on employee directories profile pages org charts please do this is highly relevant and is a killer app that is often poorly done with the new social media aspects to this seeing who is a colleague of your colleagues its a timely subject for a lot of focus
1113962 given that so many things regarding the intranet are important where will companies focus their limited time and money
1113963 we did already sponsor a project last year why do you again need some money
1113964 well be taking delegates live behind the firewall at a dozen of the worlds most advanced intranets corporate portals and information workplaces including those at google microsoft the bbc ibm nokia bt nissan ikea sap sara lee and america electric power in most instances this will be the first time that these innovative intranets have been opened up to outsiders and delegates will be able to join live q amp a sessions where they can interact directly with the teams responsible for building and managing those pioneering intranets

1113972 among affluent mothers who live within 200 meters of a highway the odds of delivering an infant with low birth weight increase by 81 percent while their odds of delivering a pre term baby increase by 58 percent compared to mothers who dont live anywhere close to expressways
1113973 advantaged mothers may be more susceptible to environmental hazards because they have been protected from other hazards these mothers may be particularly susceptible to exposure to air pollution during pregnancy which is hypothesized to interfere directly with intrauterine growth via pollutant absorption and placental exchange or indirectly by increasing maternal susceptibility to infection or impairing maternal respiratory function

1114083 because of a dramatic increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity and diabetes mellitus during the past two decades physical activity has assumed an increasingly prominent role in disease prevention and health promotion efforts in the united states and is considered one of the 10 leading health indicators for the nation
1114084 it is important to know how patterns of physical activity inactivity and sedentary behaviors for this increasing segment of the population differ from those of the majority native population
1114085 physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic immigrant groups
1114086 for example 22 5 percent of immigrant hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9 5 percent of u s born white children with u s born parents
1114087 they were however less likely to watch television three or more hours per day than native children although the nativity gap narrowed with increasing acculturation levels
1114088 given the health benefits of physical activity continued higher physical inactivity and lower activity levels in immigrant children are likely to reduce their overall health advantage over u s born populations during adulthood
1114089 to reduce disparities in childhood physical activity health education programs designed to promote physical activity should target not only children from socially disadvantaged households and neighborhoods but also children in immigrant families

1114107 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1114108 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1114109 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1114110 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1114111 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1114112 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
1114113 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
1114114 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
1114115 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
1114116 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
1114117 hey since i could have been anybody else in the world or dead or never born at all am i alright being me
1114118 although the precise mechanisms are currently under investigation the association between short sleep duration and overweight may be attributed to the interaction of behavioral and biological changes as a result of sleep deprivation
1114119 given the fact that the prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents continues to increase and chronic sleep insufficiency becomes more prevalent in modern society family and school based sleep interventions that aim to enhance sleep hygiene and increase sleep duration may have important public health implications for the prevention and intervention of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children
1114120 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep

1114148 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1114149 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1114150 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1114151 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1114152 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1114153 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1114154 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people

1114167 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1114168 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1114169 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1114170 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence
1114171 also parental nurturance may help girls cope with challenges associated with early puberty by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression
1114172 by discussing difficult peer situations e g provocation peer pressure and ways of dealing with them parents may help their daughters develop a repertoire of adaptive responses that will minimize the need for inappropriate i e aggressive behavior
1114173 in addition knowing how their daughters spend free time may help parents identify and prevent negative peer and other influences
1114174 helping parents develop positive parenting skills may help early maturing girls to grow into healthy well adjusted adolescents and adults

1114279 gender portrayal or the depiction of the feminine or masculine as a gender role is a cultural phenomenon embedded in historical processes gender roles in other words are not fixed but changeable
1114280 gender in journalism by monika djerf pierre released in june 2008 found that underrepresentation of women in media is a global problem
1114281 this important study shows in concrete and shocking terms that women more than 50 percent of the population are still being left out of a national discussion of sweeping cultural and financial significance
1114282 many of us had the belief back then that we would integrate the news and the masthead the way we had integrated the help wanted ads women would not only become full participants in political life but womens issues family children values would become equal news
1114283 women today constitute about a third of full time journalists at daily newspapers and about the same percentage at all the other news media but thats roughly the same percentage that it was 25 years ago what happened to the idea that we would sort of naturally bubble up im afraid that the fizz went a little flat

1114318 the access linux platform is well suited for the flexibility and customizability required to deliver new product concepts in the emerging mid category
1114319 by working with access to integrate omap platform based hardware and software we can provide an integrated solution for our customers to help speed time to market and deliver no compromise web browsing and an enhanced user experience
1114320 orange and access share a common vision for a truly open mobile community which delivers richer mobile services more affordable devices and a better user experience
1114321 we continue to work together in the context of limo to create a standard linux based mobile platform that will benefit the entire industry access is a key partner within the orange signature accelerator program which provides a great user experience through the delivery of embedded orange customized applications
1114322 the key is to know how and what resources to utilize to gather the best information
1114323 new users should know that there is a great community of linux users that are willingly dedicated to helping people with technical problems for absolutely nothing and those resources are available in a few different ways forums irc chat rooms mailing lists local linux user groups and a plethora of web sites dedicated to providing the community with linux how tos
1114324 if i had to write a linux starters kit it would be along these lines
1114325 windows users switching to linux need to understand packages and repositories
1114326 repositories whether yum are the killer app for linux they provide the greatest single advantage over windows from an end user perspective
1114327 but in reality installing linux software especially if its in your repositories is one of the easiest things you can do
1114328 i recently read comments about someone who gave up on linux because they couldnt install family tree maker when a perfectly good alternative gramps was only an apt get away
1114329 customization new linux users should be encouraged to customize their desktop
1114330 not only will this show off the power of xfce compared to windows but it will get the user accustomed to the idea that they can and should make changes to their computer to make it look and feel and act the way they want it to every time i see a default ubuntu desktop i see a failure to teach someone about linux
1114331 windows users are afraid of the command line and rightfully so its a scary place in windows if they think that they need the command line in linux then linux will scare them
1114332 i think they should be exposed to the terminal told what the command line equivalent is of any gui action a gui focused how to or help guide tells them to do and again encourage them to play around in it
1114333 making software free is what makes it work for them so it is important that they understand it
1114334 once the users understand the philosophy of open source they can understand the open source community and why support forums are often better than an 800 number
1114335 i think by far the easiest way to learn linux is to get together with others who know how to use linux
1114336 after the user is started its much easier to use help pages to get the rest of the way
1114337 seriously if one is technical and wants to learn linux i recommend buying one of many linux magazines they almost always have some distro cd with them in the stores then find an old machine around the house and install linux
1114338 i tend to favor the oreilly books consider starting with linux in a nutshell
1114339 start in the etc directory look at files ending in conf cfg rc look in the directory etc rc d init look at the startup scripts look in sbin and do man xxx on commands found there those are sysadmin commands youll learn about how to manage the system also look in usr sbin for some less pedantic admin commands
1114340 start ls ing in bin usr bin and usr local bin do man xxx on anything that piques your curiosity
1114341 if by now your curiosity isnt piqued stop youre not interested in linux
1114342 if this got you started i apologize in advance for taking up the next few years of your life
1114343 the first thing you need when learning linux is a solution
1114344 for me windows was bloated and the switch to linux served a purpose
1114345 id say the best way for a new user to get familiar with linux is to play with or install if a hard drives free one of the many excellent live cds available
1114346 you no longer need to understand your system to pick which distro would work the best since just about every distro works the same todays installers will not only set up a working system but actually migrate your settings from your former operating system so that you dont really even need to configure it
1114347 back in the day obtaining ice cream was a bit harder

1114536 our recommendations recognize the large number of scientific studies that demonstrate greater accuracy in identifying women at risk of having or developing cervical cancer when a pap is combined with the hpv test rather than relying on a pap smear alone
1114537 by using both tests for women 30 and over when cervical cancer is most common we hope to greatly reduce the number of women suffering and dying from this disease
1114538 unlike other cancers cervical cancer is virtually 100 percent preventable if women and their healthcare providers have access to the hpv test and other new advances in preventive care

1114547 is running its course and the two parties are still in talks to work out a solution
1114548 this good performance stems primarily from increases in power generation by the hydroelectric and natural gas facilities higher electricity and steam prices and a judgment in favour of the fund which led to the reimbursement of municipal tax amounts

1114550 ik ben niet zo vaak bij u in de kerk geweest
1114551 het is niet mijn kerk het is gods kerk we zijn allen kinderen god
1114552 zou het niet van veel groter belang zijn als god niet in jou geloofde
1114553 het gaat niet om u ik ben het die vergiffenis wil
1114554 weet je nog hoe pelgrim ten slotte zijn zonden aan god opbiechtte hoe de zware last meteen van zijn schouders werd genomen zoals de pijn overgaat als een abces wordt opengesneden
1114555 precies dezelfde woorden heb ik ook tegen anderen gezegd ja
1114556 ver hen kan ik niets zeggen wat mannen en vrouwen ook bij mij komen biechten dat biechten ze via mij aan god
1114557 daar hebben ze u dus eigenlijk niet voor nodig probeert u te zeggen
1114558 ik ben een dienaar van god soms is het mij vergund diegene te helpen die oprecht spijt hebben van hun zonden
1114559 en hoe zit het met degen die geen spijt hebben van hun zonden
1114560 zal god het hun vergeven wat ze ook hebben gedaan gelooft u dat vader
1114561 vergeef me nogmaals mijn oren laten me in de steek maar niet mn hart mijn eigen vader werd in een jappenkamp doodgemarteld in 1943 ik was toen 13 jaar oud ik weet heel goed hoe moeilijk vergiffenis kan zijn ik heb dit aan weinig mensen verteld
1114562 god heeft het hun vergeven als ze hem ooit om vergiffenis hebben gevraagd
1114563 je kunt niet spreken van beter of slechter of het nu vredestijd of oorlogstijd is gods wetten zijn de wetten die door hem zijn opgesteld die zijn onwrikbaar en standvastig als de sterren aan de hemelen onveranderlijk tot in alle eeuwigheid als iemand zich van het dak van de tempel naar beneden zou werpen doet hij de wet van god en zichzelf geweld aan maar nooit zal hij de universele wet breken die god ooit heeft verordoneerd
1114564 ik ben ook maar een mens en alle mensen hebben gezondigd en god niet de eer gegeven die hem toekomt
1114565 mijn heilige taak is het absolutie te geven in de naam van onze heer en heiland jesus christus voor de zonden van allen die oprecht berouw tonen het is niet mijn taak me bezig te houden met het functioneren van de wereldse macht

1114597 honda accord car amp driver 10 best vehicles for 15 years in a row
1114598 slowing demand and the hope for more supply is weighing on the market even as the geopolitics and the weather is getting wild
1114599 despite all these bullish inferences a lower market must mean that participants have an infinitely greater concern about a deteriorating global economy
1114600 given the forecast for tropical storm edouard shell will begin limited evacuations of approximately 40 personnel from some of its gulf of mexico west operations area today

1114606 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together
1114607 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice
1114608 i couldnt bear the thought of getting more things to dust in our home
1114609 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1114610 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1114611 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money
1114612 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware
1114613 so we thought wed have people who want to celebrate with a gift do that with these two institutions

1114620 if a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the united states by the al qaeda terrorist network
1114621 time of war was waged on lies perpetrated by a bunch of sociopaths who care nothing for the rule of law throughout this great land
1114622 the real irony is that this measure is far more of a violation of the constitution than anything bush and cheney have done
1114623 the assumption that such a category as unlawful combatant exists is not contradicted by the findings by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the celebici judgment the judgement quoted the 1958 icrc commentary on the fourth geneva convention

1114628 the management infrastructure for diverse microsoft based devices applications and other technologies
1114629 there is little if any value in live mesh for most enterprise users or others who must live and work in a heterogeneous environment
1114630 targeting developers early on is key theyve certainly learned this in the past
1114631 if you dont get the developers you dont win the platform battle
1114632 if i mesh enable a service does it mean it can be accessed from any mesh compatible device
1114633 if i dont have to do anything extra to make that phone work with a service thats cool

1114635 we believe people need to be prepared for this theres a popular demand for web 2 0 but its a bad situation in that weve given huge power to browsers but these browsers often have logic flaws that allow these attacks
1114636 this attack involves a special packet which has the effect of disconnecting the endpoint
1114637 this does assume you have access to the cisco device because you are the administrator or somehow broke in
1114638 its more a hindrance than major flaw at this point three years ago a team of ilab engineers
1114639 in a contact center space its difficult to predict spikes in the network that are unforeseen
1114640 after at amp t launches the 3g iphone for instance who knows what that will bring to our call centers the sip world has not fully matured yet to handle that kind of flux in traffic
1114641 everyone understands how tdm works but in the sip environment there has to be some more effort to get people to understand how it operates
1114642 previously a lot of people would experience problems because of a lack of standards but that was a few years back
1114643 when it comes down to it unless youre doing something really bizarre and funky with your implementation you wont have many problems
1114644 without sip trunking if you want to make a call youve got to buy a separate gateway for each location as well as dedicated circuits
1114645 with sip trunking you can carry calls over an mpls connection and any conversion has to go on within a service providers network
1114646 its a matter of kind of clearing off the rust
1114647 the goal in academia is to publish a paper rather than get something out of the lab and into the public domain
1114648 people already feel like theyre pretty smart but want to get better they may not necessarily be getting dumber

1114673 we had to account for 30 years of sins in terms of not maintaining our data
1114674 when i joined i used to tease everybody that the erp around here was microsoft excel everybody laughed but there was a lot of truth to that statement
1114675 they had a couple of microsoft access database apps which in reality only allowed them to put in a larger amount of records and there was no such thing as a business analyst at ach

1114681 this would not be an issue except that project sponsors judge project success in terms of schedule budget meet requirements

1114692 taking advantage of the cisco axp third party hosting services on the cisco integrated services router isr adds industry leading fax over ip to an already comprehensive unified communications solution
1114693 this complete solution delivers significant cost and performance benefits for mission critical fax services in many industries while facilitating highly secure communication collaboration and regulatory compliance
1114694 we really think that were changing the way business models will be built in the branch
1114695 every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings
1114696 but unlike mccain obama does not need to prove that he represents enough change when it comes
1114697 hes the change candidate therefore he needs only to make small changes
1114698 are you better off now than you were four years ago
1114699 it means that the met office and environment agency will be able to give better warnings in future because they will have a more accurate and detailed picture of the rainfall and enable them to better predict how much rain is going to fall and where
1114700 it will help northumbrian water manage surface water drainage and local authorities in the area to predict and prepare
1114701 it is really important and it is a very impressive piece of work and it completes a chain of radars covering this area
1114702 an essential part of this is having access to information to understand how our vast 16 000 km sewerage network copes in different weather conditions
1114703 the new weather radar will provide detailed information and help us better plan and prioritise flood alleviation work
1114704 to remind me never to do a thing like that again
1114705 ive had many guitars and i always call them lucille shes taken me a long way even brought me some fame most of all shes kept me alive being able to eat lucille practically saved my life two or three times
1114706 the car stopped turning over it fell over on lucille and it held it up off of me
1114707 sometimes i get to a place i cant even say nothing sometimes when im blue seems lucille tries to help me calls my name shes just like a woman and thats the only one ive had that seemed i could really depend on ive been married and each time separated from my wife but lucille never separates from me she always stayed with me
1114708 it seems that it loves to be petted and played with theres also a certain way you hold it the certain noises it makes the way it excites me and lucille dont want to play anything but the blues lucille is real when i play her its almost like hearing words and of course naturally i hear cries id be playing sometimes and as id play it seems like it almost has a conversation with me it tells you something it communicates with me the one thing that im concerned about today to make lucille sound even more like singing more in the style of my singing
1114709 i m moving to brazil i m quitting the band
1114710 i call b b my baby brother cause were only eighteen years apart i call him b b like everybody else but his real name is riley now hes got them two bs up front of his name

1114712 if you sign to spv ill give you the record from dull knife
1114713 the album has an old school early 80s underground dance hall meets new wave pop feel and for us rock steady captures that universal vibe
1114714 like playing with the soundtrack to our lives from high school through college
1114715 on the road again im so glad to be on the road again

1114719 it would take an act of god for this band to get on the radio
1114720 we went through some really bad times in the past couple years our way of dealing with that is humor and i think thats really apparent in the record
1114721 that single surprised the hell out of me i always thought the song was cool but i never expected it to fly like it has
1114722 has it got to the point where we mean nothing if gwen doesnt speak we mean nothing
1114723 not bad best new artist and weve been around for 10 years

1114727 there i am standing on top of the garbage bin that smells awful while everyone is inside a sound proof studio
1114728 its the end of the world and i feel fine
1114729 its probably a lot easier to have sex to this record than the last
1114730 its a selfish record in a way because the songs are largely about me and my insecurities i laid it all out there and it feels good

1114754 religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the rulers as useful
1114755 ive got a track saved for my band on brian slagels new metal blade label
1114756 shit guys people are realizing were useless smoke and mirrors stat
1114757 parents just want their children to grow up in an environment in which they can be surrounded by their faith tradition is this such a bad thing
1114758 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
1114759 he said for 10 you could have gotten a half case

1114761 then the suspect went to the kitchen got a big butcher knife and came back and stabbed him
1114762 the taliban are now mounting a hit and run war against their enemies
1114763 it doesnt need much money or weapons compared to what the foreign troops are spending
1114764 the increasing use of very public attacks has had a striking effect on morale far beyond the immediate victims
1114765 typically if we are unable to initially verify information directly with a journalist we will also use publicly available information from the internet however i apologize for your personal email address being listed you had a clear statement requesting that no pitches be sent to that email address on your personal website unfortunately we dont keep a history of which of our research editors create which listings we have spoken with our entire team about the importance of ensuring that only the right information is added
1114766 this bands what public enemy once was and what rage against the machine never quite managed to be the potent trifecta of credibility sincerity and real danger
1114767 were really an honest why people are listening to us
1114768 our music has always been urgent critical and questioning and that still remains
1114769 and our expression is pure and natural in terms of where it comes from i think thats always better with art because once you have something in mind and you try to achieve it it becomes less pure in some ways if you just let whatever expression there is come out it might be socially viable it might be political romantic humorous a personal narrative a philosophical thought whatever it is if its pure and it just comes out and you leave it that way i think its more potent i think its more real
1114770 and the answer is by not competing with it by not being afraid to use the new ideas that we have some bands are afraid of their fans theyre not gonna like this and theyre not gonna like that we dont have that mindset weve gotta impress ourselves before we impress the fans you gotta love yourself first you know ive gotta feel like we have everything it takes to make a record thats better than anything weve done
1114771 i look at everything we do as a continuation because its the same band and the same four individuals
1114772 so mezmerize hypnotize is still system of a down but definitely theres a huge growth its more melodic but at the same time more aggressive every album captures where you are at that moment but almost instantly youre in a new place as soon as its recorded so its just basically a window into where youre going in the future and how people want to look at that and understand it is really up to each individual
1114773 its not hard for me because weve been working together for over 10 years
1114774 i dont necessarily encompass his words when i sing them i approach them from my perspective and what they make me feel
1114775 i might have a great chorus but i dont think the verse is that great so ill ask serj can you make the verse better and he does the same thing with me on stuff that he writes
1114776 just being honest as a writer not being afraid to express different parts of my life and different parts of what i see around me some people kind of censor themselves i dont and this band doesnt its a crazy time in the world and i just stay focused on being inspired not only by the crazy times but also by everyday life it all meshes together you can look at these songs from the viewpoint of a normal joe or you can look at it in a broader way because theres a world going on around this normal joe
1114777 blast off its party time and where the fuck are you
1114778 why dont presidents fight the war why do they always send the poor why do they always send the poor
1114779 originally there was in my own performance on the first album for example a lot more ferocity and rage and aggression in terms of how i expressed myself
1114780 whereas now its almost like a way of shaking things up to raise my voice to communicate on an intense energy level which i would say is as powerful as anger and rage yet more focused and productive
1114781 in terms of dichotomy and the dynamics of the songs it just kind of comes naturally through darons songwriting and my songwriting
1114782 we just go with it to me its always been interesting both musically and lyrically to put two things next to each other that dont have a previous relationship and see what kind of relationship i can create out of them because i think thats creating something new if you can make it work its fun
1114783 and since i did write a good part of the lyrics on this record the songs tend to take a middle ground rather than being one sided about it i think thats why my world and serjs come together so well lyrically because hes more politically motivated and im not but some of his stuff makes mine more serious and some of my stuff makes his stuff a little bit more human as i was sequencing the records i realized that if i went to a shrink and he hypnotized me i would be singing some of these songs
1114784 i dont feel any particular responsibility in discussing social or political things
1114785 its something thats in my heart ive always had a problem with injustice whether its personal national international or universal its just always bothered me to the point where i have to say or do something i think action is worth a million words though as far as thats concerned but ultimately if theres one thing id like to do more than anything else its to not take this life so seriously
1114786 every day that comes i thank my higher power that im alive and doing what i do for a living because i love it
1114787 its something ive dreamt of doing and ive worked my ass off to get where im at i dont take any of it for granted
1114788 but in the end if someone has a compelling argument everyone else will listen even if that persons in the minority so its a true democracy in that everyones voice is heard
1114789 the impact that weve had on people artistically socially and politically is pretty amazing
1114790 its a huge compliment and its a very special thing i think system of a down in itself is very special in that sense
1114791 its about the audience finding you rather than you finding the audience
1114792 a lot of bands are marketed by labels to certain demographics with us it was just the opposite from day one we toured pretty heavily until we built up a certain amount of fans that bought our cds and saw our shows before we approached radio or video in any way so that set us apart thats the old fashioned way and its how bands should be broken and thats why i had a good long career and one thats perpetually increasing were not an overnight success kind of band
1114793 but its really tough to explain until you hear it individually in my opinion they both stand on their own but until you hear the second one you wont know how the two records come together as one were not leavin you dry
1114794 if you follow your heart and you follow your path then youll always be safe with anything that you do including art
1114795 it would take an act of god for this band to get on the radio
1114796 we went through some really bad times in the past couple years our way of dealing with that is humor and i think thats really apparent in the record

1114829 wer sich ernsthaft mit dem islamismus auseinander setzt kommt nicht darum herum sich auch mit dem zionismus auseinander zu setzen
1114830 der anspruch einen religi s fundierten judenstaat in nahost zu errichten und seine grenzen zug um zug auf kosten der dort lebenden pal stinenser zu erweitern kann nicht auf das verst ndnis der araber z hlen deren rechtsbewusstsein so nachhaltig verletzt wird
1114831 da auch die gro m chte und die uno die israels existenz garantieren den verdr ngten keine perspektive bieten w chst angesichts eines milit risch hochger steten ber atomwaffen verf genden und zudem die resolutionen der uno permanent missachtenden israel ein islamischer fundamentalismus heran der in seiner politischen wie milit rischen ohnmacht dann zur gewalt aus verzweiflung greift
1114832 der wunsch einen rein j dischen oder vorwiegend j dischen staat in einem arabischen pal stina im zwanzigsten jahrhundert zu schaffen konnte zu nichts anderem als zu einer kolonial typischen situation und der entwicklung eines rassistischen bewusstseins und in letzter konsequenz zu einer milit rischen konfrontation f hren
1114833 immer wieder vertreter jenes zionismus die politische f hrung bernahmen die der expansion ber die grenzen von 1948 hinaus absoluten vorrang vor der integration gaben
1114834 bedingungslos von den usa aber auch von den westeurop ischen staaten unterst tzt
1114835 nur so konnten nach dem sieg 1967 alle nachfolgenden regierungen bis ehud olmert ihren zionistischen traum von erez israel mittels siedlungsbau landraub annexion und mauerbau verfolgen
1114836 man mag es unrecht nennen was der arabischen bev lkerung pal stinas in teilen widerfahren ist wie den indianern nord und s damerikas im 18 und 19 jahrhundert den slawen im osten des heiligen r mischen reiches oder den iren vom 16 jahrhundert bis zum beginn des 20 jahrhunderts ja man kann sogar den normannen bei der einnahme der keltischen insel 1066 ihr unrecht vor augen halten
1114837 steht deshalb das existenzrecht gro britanniens in frage muss die krone endlich dieses unrecht anerkennen um ein normaler staat zu werden oder das nato mitglied t rkei die massaker an den armeniern ffentlich bedauern bevor man den t rken die territoriale integrit t zugesteht
1114838 seit 1967 bte israel die herrschaft ber einen gro en teil der pal stinensischen bev lkerung aus und sein verhalten kann in vieler hinsicht kritisiert werden dennoch k nnte nur ein narr behaupten dass sich die pal stinenser in der umgekehrten situation mit den ma nahmen wie sie die israelis getroffen haben zufrieden geben w rden sollten die pal stinenser jemals herrschaft ber die juden erlangen wird pal stina ebenso judenrein werden wie es der gr te teil europas heute ist eine kleine gemeinde hier und dort und gespenster berall um es so deutlich wie m glich zu sagen israel blockiert lediglich die nationalen ambitionen der pal stinenser beziehungsweise hat das fr her getan die pal stinenser hingegen bedrohen die nackte existenz der juden
1114839 ausgrenzung der arabischen mitb rger als b rger zweiter klasse
1114840 deshalb kaum die raketen aus dem gazastreifen die weigerung der hamas das existenzrecht israels vor kl rung der grenzen anzuerkennen und die forderungen der pal stinenser nach einem eigenen staat noch die finsteren botschaften eines ahmadinedjad die die gefahr f r die existenz israels ausmachen
1114841 es ist die fortdauer der besatzung die sich wie ein gef ngnis um die pal stinenserinnen und pal stinenser schlie t die gefahr f r israel kommt von innen weniger von au en selbst wenn nicht zu bestreiten ist dass die raketen die konfrontation versch rfen und den friedensprozess gef hrden

1114905 to go higher i think we need the sentiment to change with lower energy prices crude oil dropping below the 117 area certainly would provide a very visible benefit in terms of the economy but it also makes the problems seems a little bit less severe
1114906 were kind of going through a period of healing and trying to maybe etch out some kind of bottom
1114907 a lot of times you just dont reach a bottom and go straight up
1114908 it will cover the damages foreseen by the program which is uninsured damages incurred by residents and also the extraordinary expenses of the municipalities
1114909 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened
1114910 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1114911 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1114912 i dont think a vaccine specialist could do it this is aerosol physics not biology there are very few people who have their feet in both camps
1114913 i really dont think hes the guy i say to the fbi show me your evidence
1114914 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
1114915 mourns the loss of dr bruce ivins who served the institute for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist
1114916 that seems like an unusual thing to say if you believe one of your employees had something to do with an anthrax attack
1114917 it now remains incumbent on the fbi to reveal what information it had linking ivins to the attacks given the federal governments record on the anthrax investigation and the national security interests involved ivins death should not be used as an excuse for the case to be closed without a full public airing
1114918 the family definitely wants to be able to see the evidence that the fbi has accumulated that theyre not just trying to make this guy a scapegoat
1114919 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
1114920 dozens of other researchers in ivins lab also had access to the type of ames strain used in the attacks the scientist said meaning the dna alone is not enough to prove his guilt
1114921 the fbi owes it to the country to provide some accounting of their investigation and their expectations for a successful conclusion
1114922 its been frustrating that the fbi has essentially shut out congress throughout its seven year investigation now seems to be the opportune time for the bureau to brief congress about whether the case is to be closed and justice will be served in the meantime we should remember that a rush to judgment can be dangerous and expensive for everyone the last person the fbi had in its sights in this case suffered for six years and just collected a 6 million settlement
1114923 he was surprised by the question and although he said hed been speaking with reporters all day none of the other reporters not one of them had asked him about his brothers political affiliations leanings or beliefs
1114924 i realized this morning that the man in the mirror is kind of hard to look at im not sure what ive got going on on my face anymore but im done with it ive lost my appetite recently and frankly im not sure how youre even able to interview me right now
1114925 im going to cover all the mirrors in wonderland with inspirational quotes and pictures of waterfalls and unicorns floating above them i want to get inspired when i see these pictures itll be a lot better than what i had going on before
1114926 michael jackson no longer starting with the man in the mirror
1114927 what happened this morning was completely unacceptable and disrespectful to the ipod family of products and the engineers who work on them a zune is like a retarded cousin of the ipod this is a work environment were building the future here we dont have any time for dealing with retarded cousins leave them at home
1114928 when youre called the as people expect you to play at a high level we dont believe we can now field a team that will produce at that level so we are now going to be the fs to be more in line with expectations
1114929 totally cool with me ive been sucking for the past few years since i got a new contract now that im an f people will consider me awesome if i perform at a c level
1114930 were doing this for the american people we want to show that just because something has never been done before doesnt mean it isnt a great idea
1114931 were taking out a 3 year arm which will help us out in the short term well leave it to the next administration to deal with refinancing it again in 2011
1114932 of course well help out the children of america with this money but i may also do some improvements to the landscape maybe put up some more trees i like a nice garden you see i like it when birds choose to hang out in my garden if laura lets me i may add a third floor and really make this a great place to live a real symbol of america
1114933 i keep getting those credit card applications in the mail so i know people realize ive got good credit
1114934 was missing that edge that spark that could propel us to the next level i realized that what we really needed was someone to motivate our players to excel beyond any levels theyve previously played at the inside game would come as a result of that so we unfortunately had to say bye bye to shaq
1114935 im going to be able to help these guys out and see immediate results when they get back out there on the court im going to try and convince coach to put me on the floor during free throws so i can motivate the shooter even more
1114936 ive still got 3 good years left in this body i cant believe they dumped me for some white boy that cant even shoot a free throw
1114937 west end residents need to pay strict attention to the tides
1114938 this is not a call for an evacuation but we want people to use their own judgment
1114939 were pretty limited on what we can do on land and in the air these days
1114940 a few moments later after the idea had time to settle in our minds for a bit we started warming up to it at first we thought wed do something along the lines of rounding up a school of sharks and bringing them closer to shore to terrify all the people just like in that american movie jaws thats where we get all our great ideas from
1114941 as a flash of brilliance from the almighty allah im sitting there in my cave and this idea just like came out of nowhere i had a vision of me scuba diving with a knife and i knew i would be the one to make it happen so i spent the last 6 months getting my padi scuba certification im actually a certified instructor now too so i can train my soldiers and save on training costs
1114942 sometimes you just cant cover all your bases it was an infidel move on my part
1114943 buying tickets with foreign currencies sneaking out from one country to the next always on the go it would have been perfect
1114944 you know in the end its not about the money its about making the most of your time here on earth before you rise to allah and claim your 42 virgins
1114945 as long as they dont require knowledge of u s trivia like jeopardy
1114946 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1114947 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure
1114948 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1114949 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1114950 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the
1114951 earlier this year in a manhattan apartment said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation has not been concluded
1114952 actress a fourth time after paramedics arrived at some point during the flurry of calls olsen who was in california summoned her personal security guards to the apartment to help police said save up to 75 on cruises
1114953 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1114954 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1114955 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1114956 she really wants to help people out and this is her way of reaching out a hand and saying its okay to do that line because thats only step 1 of the process
1114957 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early for one thing
1114958 theres a lot of things to juggle with a project like this and i felt a lot of responsibility
1114959 i had to get into georges head and find out exactly what he wanted us to produce it wasnt that easy in the beginning because i didnt have a lot of access to him he was busy finishing revenge of the sith but i got bits and pieces of information and the bottom line was that he wanted us to produce something that nobody had ever seen before on the television screen and ultimately animation for the movie screen that is really unique
1114960 i thought that it was really important that the crew working on the movie feel the same way i do about this stuff i grew up with star wars and really believe in it its something that inspired me creatively and inspired many generations
1114961 i think we decided that it can but only if it had a kryptonite crystal in it or if the fight took place on a planet with out a yellow sun
1114962 i think living in the star wars world or at least writing in it really gives you a sense of it
1114963 if youre in that world all the time its starts to feel like home and its really easy to write about home when youre familiar with the world and the universe
1114964 george told me that he has a lot of respect for editors and editorial as a craft and an art form so that put me at ease
1114965 hes really open to new ideas at the end of the day what i think i learned most from him is clarity how to make it clear as possible
1114966 as we started to develop the project and he started to see the material he became more and more excited
1114967 ill never forget what he said were not making television here were making cinema

1114970 o rod zio de caminh es tem prejudicado o setor farmac utico tenho feito pesquisa de opini o e de impacto na opera o n o cheguei a fazer pesquisa com dados estat sticos sobre impacto no custo
1114971 no setor farmac utico o que me espantou foi o fato de a legisla o prever por exemplo exce o para os supermercados em rela o a produtos sujeitos ao controle de temperatura citando por exemplo crust ceos qual o interesse p blico que existe em o estado garantir ao setor de supermercados que seja feito o transporte de crust ceos num per odo diferenciado
1114972 do ponto de vista jur dico social e democr tico muito melhor obter do estado essa negocia o e ter uma administra o com paridade em rela o iniciativa privada do que sempre colocar o judici rio para arbitrar esse conflito
1114973 se por um lado n o se pode criar muitas exce es de modo que o rod zio fique aniquilado por outro acho que h atividades essenciais que realmente merecem outro tipo de tratamento se para a popula o interessa um tr nsito que flua melhor e se isso tem a ver com direito liberdade acho que o direito vida muito maior
1114974 pick a day this week and try to eat only locally grown or made products for breakfast lunch and dinner and any snacks in between
1114975 i think that with the influx of food that were getting in the united states from other countries that have not been healthy for us in the last couple years whether its salmonella food from mexico or whether its tainted food from china the only safe way to eat is to buy from your local farmer where you can ask directly how hes growing his food what hes putting on it
1114976 broadband is an essential resource in todays world and economy this new law is a resounding victory for the residents students and businesses in communities that have gone without it for too long
1114977 expanding access to broadband will create substantial opportunities for economic academic and cultural growth
1114978 as someone who has worked on this issue for many years i can say without reservation that the governors leadership has had a profound effect on crystallizing this issue in the public and the legislature
1114979 this is a significant step toward high speed internet access for all of the citizens of western massachusetts access that will be critical to the future economic development education and communications in these underserved communities
1114980 for far too long residents of the communities i represent have been blocked from the on ramp to the information superhighway
1114981 today we see true progress backed by a 40 million state investment to bring broadband to western massachusetts it has been a pleasure working with my colleagues in the delegation and the patrick administration to secure swift passage of this legislation and i look forward to continuing our collaborations to achieve of our collective goal universal broadband access in all of massachusetts
1114982 with the signing of this legislation a world of business educational and cultural opportunities will open up for thousands of people all across the commonwealth
1114983 this is a remarkable step forward for the entire state
1114984 this program will make our bridges safer at a time of critical need create thousands of jobs and provide long term economic benefits along the way
1114985 by investing today we will complete more bridge projects in less time and at a lower cost
1114986 it was imperative that we took this immediate action to better maintain our infrastructure for the safety and security of all who travel our roads and bridges
1114987 this new law brings the added boost of a shot in the arm to our workforce through the creation of new construction jobs and a much need stimulus to our entire economy
1114988 the state has gone too long without basic maintenance and preventative work on its bridges and i applaud governor patricks attention to what has become a serious public safety concern
1114989 our bridges are essential to the daily operations of commerce and travel by taking action now we can begin immediately to make up for decades of neglect and avoid higher costs in the future
1114990 a policy comeback that saw qualified success on most of his major initiatives
1114991 its the same way with the big rock n roll stars
1114992 you think its all glitz and glamour but its a lot of time on the road away from your family sleeping in strange places its fun for now but its also a lot of work

1114998 as you know she worked her heart and soul out on the presidential campaign

1115004 i think karateka should train like boxers do with punching bags and with sparring to much time is spent training one way and fighting another
1115005 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
1115006 how changes to beliefs about climate change occur when consumers read information supplied by the news media
1115007 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth
1115008 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
1115009 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience
1115010 the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
1115011 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
1115012 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to diabetes out of control and congestive heart failure because of hypertension
1115013 we found some pretty striking differences when we compared uninsured individuals with one of these seven conditions with insured individuals with one of the conditions
1115014 these are conditions that we take care of in the clinic we know that we can prevent disabling complications or catastrophe if we are able to manage these conditions
1115015 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
1115016 but having insurance is not likely to prove to be a panacea for these folks
1115017 people with chronic conditions who are insured are not doing so well either we do not do a very good job of delivering chronic care in this country for anyone
1115018 i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there that has been a top priority for us this is an administration thats been anti science whether its on stem cell research whether its on climate change they have rejected science i want to reverse that trend i want us to be a science based society and i want us to invest in science
1115019 while my opponent seems content to retreat from american exploration of space for a decade i am not

1115030 there is certainly less buzz around this barcelona trip than the last trip two years ago
1115031 the arrest was made based on a tip we received
1115032 an investigation like this is so complex that we always ask for the publics assistance
1115033 we filed a police report that the van had been involved in an accident
1115034 arnel told us but he didnt say he was in an accident
1115035 the arrest was made based on a tip we received
1115036 an investigation like this is so complex that we always ask for the publics assistance everything we do has a purpose
1115037 i have not seen my brother since they took him
1115038 it will shock me it is so sad it is unbelievable that my brother would do something like this to hit someone and leave them behind
1115039 were very happy to get closure but were still confused how the police could be so sure it was a red flatbed truck and now it turns out to be a white van
1115040 it mesmerizes me that its a white van no flatbed no lights just a regular gmc savannah van
1115041 i asked how do you know its a red truck are you confident and an officer told me to be thankful its not a white truck because there are a whole lot of white trucks and it would be tougher to find
1115042 and ask him why he didnt stop to help my son i dont know how much he suffered to leave anyone in that kind of condition is appalling to me
1115043 nothing will bring my son back but it makes our family feel better that justice may be served upon him were very relieved that progress has been made were confident the honolulu police department has been doing the best it can

1115047 through a global tax preferably on carbon emitting fossil fuels
1115048 we will need in the end to put real resources in support of our hopes a global tax on carbon emitting fossil fuels might be the way to begin

1115052 facebook has an internal valuation of 4 billion it will begin letting current employees sell 20 percent of their fully vested stock options at that valuation starting this fall ive learned from well connected sources
1115053 t o be clear the internal valuation applies to common stock t he company values its common stock at 4 billion but also values its preferred stock at 15 billion the reason for the 15 billion preferred stock valuation is that preferred stock holders have certain rights including the right to sell their stock first and get their invested money back before common stockholders are allowed to sell any stock

1115060 any prediction like this is just a guess but im hoping well have a synthetic cell in under 10 years such a cell would be unrelated to any existing life form on earth szostak said other experts however said it might take decades or centuries before scientists would be able to create life from scratch as the quest is colloquially known meanwhile researchers are laboriously modifying and assembling existing biological molecules to construct synthetic cells with some but far from all of the attributes of living creatures so far what theyre doing is more like copying natures clever tricks than creating new life forms in the laboratory with all the tremendous philosophical social and religious issues that such a stunning feat would imply creating artificial life is very different from reproducing what existed already in nature said eckhard wimmer a microbiologist at stony brook university on long island ny that artificial life may be possible in the future but this future may be hundreds of years away according to szostak a living cell has two essential needs first a set of genes that contain instructions for it to eat grow divide and reproduce and second a surrounding membrane or wall that separates its contents from the outside world but allows nutrients to enter in june szostak announced that his lab had constructed a model protocell a synthetic membrane enclosing a copy of an existing strand of genetic material his team now is trying to synthesize the other half of the puzzle some form of artificial dna weve made good progress on the cell membrane leaving the genetic material as the major challenge szostak said george church a genetics professor at harvard medical school in boston and anthony forster a pharmacologist at vanderbilt university in nashville tenn are the co authors of a plan to construct what they call a minimal cell containing only 151 genes thats far fewer than the smallest natural microorganism which has nearly 500 our proposal is quite different from natural life
1115061 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
1115062 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
1115063 any discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement
1115064 but in the years now months run up to the olympics the reality has been numbingly disappointing
1115065 i suppose it was just a bunch of words when they made those promises
1115066 when the chinese government is serious about something they do it
1115067 china is a responsible country we will fulfill the promises we made for the olympics
1115068 the ideas out there that china made commitments on human rights but its simply not true
1115069 nobody was in any mood to make any promises then

1115132 top 10 quotes from the book that served me well
1115133 the fact some worship in the old testament was regarded as offensive to god e g gn 4 3 7 ex 32 is 1 is a reminder that what is impressive or seems appropriate to us may be offensive to him
1115134 worship in the new testament is a comprehensive category describing the christians total existence it is coextensive with the faith response wherever and whenever that response is elicited consequently our traditional understanding of worship as restricted to the cultic gathering of the congregation at a designated time and place for rite and proclamation will no longer do this is not what the new testament means by worship
1115135 again and again the old testament makes the point that the holy one can be approached only in the way that he himself stipulates and makes possible
1115136 with one eye on the past and what jesus has done for us we need to express our gratitude to god for his grace towards us and reach out together to experience afresh the forgiveness and restoration he has promised us with another eye on the future and what it will mean for us to share with christ in his coming kingdom we need to encourage one another in this hope and to learn what it means to live as the redeemed community in the present
1115137 preaching about christ must be at the heart of a christian theology of worship as in the old testament the word of the lord is central to a genuine encounter with god those who are concerned about god honouring worship will be concerned about the proclamation of the gospel in the world and in the church in public teaching and private dialogue if worship is an engagement with god on the terms that he proposes and in the way that he alone makes possible preaching christ is a key to that engagement
1115138 when christians become preoccupied with the notion of offering god acceptable worship in a congregational context and thus with the minutiae of church services they need to be reminded that pauls focus was on the service of everyday life
1115139 although the conversion of an unbeliever in the course of a church service is much to be desired evangelism is not the primary purpose of the gathering according to 1 corinthians 14
1115140 fundamentally then worship in the new testament means believing the gospel and responding with ones whole life and being to the person and work of gods son in the power of the holy spirit
1115141 they must come to grips with the new testament perspective that acceptable worship is an engagement with god through jesus christ in the holy spirit a christ centered gospel serving life orientation

1115165 this event is aimed at educating members of public bodies from across the state about their responsibilities under rhode islands sunshine laws
1115166 there is a well known saying that all politics are local in a real sense all government is local too and local government officials who are our citizens first points of contact in our representative democracy must do their utmost to keep government open accountable and responsive it is only when citizens are fully informed that they can fully participate in the decision making processes big and small which affect them
1115167 since its enactment two years ago the social host law has helped hold adults responsible for furnishing alcohol to anyone under the legal age of 21
1115168 arrests have been made adults have been held accountable now with the law substantially strengthened we as a community are further empowered to curb underage drinking by putting more responsibility where it belongs on the adult enablers of underage drinking
1115169 underage drinking is heavily connected to all types of dangerous and risky behaviors before this bill passed there was nothing in rhode island law that held adults responsible for permitting the use of alcohol by minors under the supervision of an adult
1115170 we are grateful to attorney general lynch for his leadership in crafting and advocating for the passage and then the strengthening of this bill as well as to everyone involved in championing initiatives means and methods to keep our kids safe sober and alive
1115171 thanks to madd and all invested in the safety of our kids we have taken significant steps to address a serious societal problem and most importantly to help our youth resist underage drinking and its disruptive dangerous and sometimes tragic effects

1115212 to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
1115213 there is nothing in that language that the plaintiff must demonstrate a transfer
1115214 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
1115215 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
1115216 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
1115217 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
1115218 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
1115219 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
1115220 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
1115221 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
1115222 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
1115223 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
1115224 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
1115225 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
1115226 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
1115227 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
1115228 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
1115229 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
1115230 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
1115231 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

1115493 bakrie telecom is proud to partner with qualcomm and grameen foundation to provide enhanced communication and information access to remote communities in indonesia from the beginning we believe that telecommunication is a birthright for every indonesian citizen based on our competency we try to implement reliable and affordable telecommunication services
1115494 uber esia is a breakthrough in indonesias telecommunication industry and for bakrie telecom as well as a valuable instrument to help indonesias rural communities to enhance the economic and social livelihoods of those who are underserved

1115504 las variaciones en el co2 muestran poca relaci n con el clima de nuestro planeta en el largo medio o corto plazo
1115505 yo y los otros cient ficos de primer nivel que trabajan conmigo siempre encontramos excelentes v nculos entre las fluctuaciones del sol y el clima de la tierra esto no es sorprendente el sol y las estrellas son la mayor fuente de energ a de este planeta
1115506 los cient ficos solares predicen que para 2020 el sol entrar en su ciclo schwabe m s d bil de los ltimos dos siglos dando lugar a condiciones inusualmente fr as en la tierra
1115507 la actividad solar ha sobredimesionado cualquier efecto que el co2 pueda haber tenido
1115508 si fu ramos a tener un m nimo solar de mediana intensidad estar amos presenciando muchos m s efectos negativos que los que ha tenido el calentamiento global
1115509 los efectos de la actividad solar y los volcanes son imposibles de ignorar las temperaturas han fluctuado exactamente como se ha esperado y el patr n ha sido tan claro que estad sticamente las probabilidades de que esa correlaci n sea azarosa son de uno a cien

1115518 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues
1115519 dah big willy unleashed was designed by a wii developer specifically for the wii when it was ported over to the psp the controls simply didnt translate well and instead of pushing out the product with translated controls it was cancelled
1115520 i dont care what the detractors say im right on iraq
1115521 a rather scarily long list of great ideas for ways to support the community
1115522 weve got loads of plans were going to support it massively
1115523 content packs new objects new game modes all of this stuff could be done what were basically waiting to see is what the demand is for
1115524 we can do all of that stuff we will do all of that stuff but what order we do it in and how much weight we throw behind any of the different ideas that different people have got is totally down to what the community does
1115525 that really excites me because if people are loving the costumes we can crank them out if people are loving the levels and master classes weve got a slightly scarily long list of great ideas for ways to support the community and its just a matter of prioritising at this stage
1115526 i can definitely say that there will be content thats available to people free of charge im just not saying exactly what that content is going to be right now
1115527 i can also say that if theres any way we can reward the community well go there if people are clamouring for big chunks of content it would make total sense for us to do it were just exploring all options at this point sequels why not dlc yeah why not paid for content why not
1115528 without that you might as well have implanted a jelly sock
1115529 well get much better horses in e its only a few miles a couple of strong men like us can make it with no problem at all
1115530 keep the smudge in sight and well be on our way
1115531 theres a lot of them here these days come in from out west to try and clean up thats what his brothers doing
1115532 i dont know what about adolf i mean that name would kind of suck to have
1115533 i mean why not just call your kid satan and be done with it
1115534 that is like the girliest reason to be a fan of a team

1115536 there would be no society if living together depended upon understanding each other
1115537 there are moments in life when the heart is so full of emotion that if by chance it be shaken or into its depths like a pebble drops some careless word it overflows and its secret spilt on the ground like water can never be gathered together
1115538 why didnt we think of that what a brilliant idea
1115539 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of traveling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
1115540 i came to realize how much we take at face value we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
1115541 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
1115542 it is always good to question how we know what we know but it is also good to have the ability to accept compelling evidence such as the photographs of earth from space
1115543 an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
1115544 the fact the earth is flat is not my opinion it is a proved fact while all we need to know is that the bible says the earth is flat is 40 22 ez 7 2 dn 2 35 4 10 11 20 mt 4
1115545 senator barack obama arrived in baghdad on monday meeting with prime minister maliki and other senior iraqi politicians as an iraqi spokesman said that the government was hopeful that foreign combat troops would withdraw in 2010
1115546 sen barack obama received a fresh boost monday to his troop withdrawal plan from the iraqi government which directly affirmed for the first time that it shares obamas goal of pulling u s troops out of iraq by the end of 2010
1115547 republican sen john mccain on monday drew closer to his democratic presidential opponents timetable on iraq saying that u s troops could be largely withdrawn in two years
1115548 the iraqis have been sending signals for months they didnt want long term u s bases they didnt want u s troops acting independently any more they wanted some sort of drawdown
1115549 in iraq it means that maliki now feels confident that he is in charge of the government and that the governments internal opposition the sunni insurgent remnants and the followers of muqtada al sadr dont have the strength to threaten him or his kurdish and hakim family allies
1115550 its of tremendous concern to the chiefs of americas largest departments that the programs they rely on have been dramatically decreased
1115551 one of the best designed and most risk oriented and most effective grant programs across the federal government
1115552 it seems to me that if a community doesnt feel a need for homeland security money they ought to say look
1115553 we need to recognize that there are a finite number of dollars available
1115554 i certainly share the concern that we not diminish the focus on law enforcement as we move forward
1115555 every potential president republican or democrat would likely inherit more than 100 000 occupying troops in january 2009 every one would be attempting to redeploy them as prudently as possible and to build stronger alliances both in the region and in the world every major candidate moreover will pledge to use targeted military force against al qaeda if necessary every one is committed to ensuring that iran will not have a nuclear bomb every one is committed to an open ended deployment in afghanistan and an unbending alliance with israel we are fighting over something to be sure but it is more a fight over how we define ourselves and over long term goals than over what is practically to be done on the ground

1115559 if the vice president did nothing wrong what is there to hide
1115560 i am greatly concerned about the chilling effect that compliance with the committees subpoena would have on future white house deliberations and white house cooperation with future justice department investigations
1115561 we seek to hold those public officials responsible for this serious breach of national security accountable for their actions and to ensure that future generations of public servants are not tempted to engage in similarly despicable behavior
1115562 an arrangement that for decades has balanced congressional oversight responsibility with the need to protect intelligence information
1115563 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
1115564 the further reduction of u s combat forces from iraq
1115565 i think its important to remember that the discussions about timeline issues previously were from democrats in congress who wanted to arbitrarily retreat from iraq without consideration of conditions on the ground
1115566 has reversed course and dropped his adamant opposition to a timeline for redeployment of american troops from iraq
1115567 also has acknowledged the need to transition from a combat mission to one that focuses on training and counterterrorism
1115568 we know enough to say we cant make a single plan that works across the nation
1115569 its a strategy not an operating manual not a how to manual
1115570 having to survive the disaster and then the fema housing plan may be too much to ask

1115576 we dont need ideological stowaways undermining the work of the next administration
1115577 it would be very damaging to justice department morale to allow any burrowing in at all
1115578 we need to take action now to expand domestic oil production
1115579 with this action the executive branchs restrictions on this exploration have been cleared away this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is action from the u s congress
1115580 people who tell us that the solution to our problem is drilling offshore are peddling our addiction
1115581 the drug is oil and they dont want us to get off it
1115582 would merely prolong the failed energy policies we have seen from washington for 30 years
1115583 if we can show that we have significant oil reserves off our coasts that will clearly affect the futures market and affect the price of oil

1115593 the longer i live the more i realize the impact of attitude on life attitude to me is more important than facts it is more important than the past the education the money than circumstances than failure than successes than what other people think or say or do it is more important than appearance giftedness or skill it will make or break a company a church a home the remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day we cannot change our past we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way we cannot change the inevitable the only thing we can do is play on the one string we have and that is our attitude i am convinced that life is 10 what happens to me and 90 of how i react to it and so it is with you we are in charge of our attitudes
1115594 no one knows what the market will look like in six months
1115595 we believe we will shortly be back to profitability and be able to earn the dividend
1115596 so we dont want to take the short term hit of cutting the dividend this time
1115597 these assets that we sold accounted for about 70 percent of the all the losses weve taken over the last twelve months
1115598 so when we had the opportunity to sell them and to sell them in a bulk sale which obviously has a bulk discount price to it and to raise the capital at the same time we took advantage of that opportunity because its a great risk reduction trade
1115599 and so if asset values continue to fall particularly mortgage assets we still have some exposure

1115619 events appear to have confirmed the worst fears of the great political scientist samuel huntington in his landmark 1993 article the clash of civilizations the harvard professor wrote the centuries old military interaction between the west and islam is unlikely to decline it could become more virulent a decade before president bush argued that democracy promotes peace huntington had observed in the arab world western democracy strengthens anti western political forces as they turn against the iraq war americans seem also to have rejected the sunny assumptions about the middle east upon which it was founded bush argued that terrorism was the work of a tiny handful of extremists repudiated by the vast majority of middle easterners his fellow americans no longer believe him more and more are coming to believe that islam really is inherently hostile to democracy and the west civilizations are clashing paul wolfowitz has lost sam huntington has won

1115621 we contacted crittenden to confirm that she wrote the e mail she asked why chatterbox wanted to know chatterbox explained that he was writing about it crittenden asked why chatterbox was writing about it chatterbox explained that it was newsworthy i dont see why it is newsworthy she replied you are asking about personal correspondence with friends and family im disturbed that anyone would forward personal correspondence to you and frankly i think its wrong of you to write about it sounds like a confirmation
1115622 george w bush was hardly the obvious man for the job but by a very strange fate he turned out to be of all unlikely things the right man
1115623 a world at peace a world governed by law a world in which all peoples are free to find their own destinies that dream has not yet come true it will not come true soon but if it ever does come true it will be brought into being by american armed might and defended by american might too
1115624 we can feel the will to win ebbing in washington we sense the reversion to the bad old habits of complacency and denial
1115625 frum and perle want transformation from 30 000 feet without the moral taint of compromise they scorn the diplomats who must deal with foreigners not to mention the foreigners themselves
1115626 to david frum it now looks as if defeat may be inescapable because the insurgency has proven it can kill anyone who cooperates and the united states and its friends have failed to prove that it can protect them
1115627 its true i fear that there is a real danger that the united states will lose in iraq and yes i do blame a lot that has gone wrong on failures of u s policy
1115628 my most fundamental views on the war in iraq remain as they were in 2003 the war was right victory is essential and defeat would be calamitous
1115629 it appears that after 9 11 the network of hawks and neoconservatives that had coalesced around pnacs founding agenda had mobilized in a highly coordinated way to fashion the administrations response to the terrorist attacks and rally the public behind their new agenda
1115630 i think if i had been delphic and had seen where we are today and people had said should we go into iraq i think now i probably would have said no lets consider other strategies for dealing with the thing that concerns us most which is saddam supplying weapons of mass destruction to terrorists i dont say that because i no longer believe that saddam had the capability to produce weapons of mass destruction or that he was not in contact with terrorists i believe those two premises were both correct could we have managed that threat by means other than a direct military intervention well maybe we could have
1115631 i do not agree with richard perle that we should never have gone in i do argue that the execution should have been better in fact i argued in late 2003 that we needed more troops and a proper counterinsurgency policy
1115632 i dont think the additional troops are the key to the strategy bush has announced it is how effectively those troops are managed
1115633 the big question in my mind is whether we can implement some practical and prudent measures i dont know if we can it will depend significantly on the command in the country
1115634 for those of us who are involved in foreign and defense policy today my generation the defining moment of our history was certainly the holocaust it was the destruction the genocide of a whole people and it was the failure to respond in a timely fashion to a threat that was clearly gathering we dont want that to happen again when we have the ability to stop totalitarian regimes we should do so because when we fail to do so the results are catastrophic
1115635 for us terrorism remains the great evil of our time and the war against this evil our generations great cause there is no middle way for americans it is victory or holocaust
1115636 chalabi paved the way in iraq for what we want to do in syria
1115637 theres no reason to think engagement with syria will bring about any change
1115638 has never been weaker and we should take advantage of that
1115639 proximity is critical in politics and policy and the geography of this administration has changed condoleezza rice has moved from the white house to foggy bottom a mere mile or so away what matters is not that she is further removed from the oval office rices influence on the president is undiminished it is rather that she is now in the midst of and increasingly represents a diplomatic establishment that is driven to accommodate its allies even when or it seems especially when such allies counsel the appeasement of our adversaries
1115640 israel must now deal a blow of such magnitude to those who would destroy it as to leave no doubt that its earlier policy of acquiescence is over this means precise military action against hezbollah and its infrastructure in lebanon and syria for as long as it takes and without regard to mindless diplomatic blather about proportionality for what appears to some to be a disproportionate response to small incursions and kidnappings is in fact an entirely appropriate response to the existential struggle in which israel is now engaged
1115641 removing saddam hussein from power in iraq was an important israeli strategic objective in its own right
1115642 a clean break a new strategy for securing the realm
1115643 prove insufficient israel should strike at select targets in syria proper
1115644 israel can shape its strategic environment in cooperation with turkey and jordan by weakening containing even rolling back syria
1115645 could be the prelude to a redrawing of the map of the middle east which could threaten syrias territorial integrity
1115646 current american policy toward iraq is not succeeding and that we may soon face a threat in the middle east more serious than any we have known since the end of the cold war
1115647 only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction in the near term this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing in the long term it means removing saddam hussein and his regime from power
1115648 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism the united states must therefore provide full military and financial support to the iraqi opposition american military force should be used to provide a safe zone in iraq from which the opposition can operate and american forces must be prepared to back up our commitment to the iraqi opposition by all necessary means
1115649 i have seen controversies like this before and i know that this one will inevitably distract from the urgent challenge in which you are now engaged i would not wish to cause even a moments distraction from that challenge as i cannot quickly or easily quell criticism of me based on errors of fact concerning my activities the least i can do under these circumstances is to ask you to accept my resignation as chairman of the defense policy board
1115650 i make reference to buchanans remark solely because i am positive 99 percent of you didnt know he said it pat made the comment on the unwatched program buchanan and press on americas most unwatched network msnbc
1115651 a quick nexis search reveals that buchanans remark has been mentioned or discussed in over 100 newspaper articles
1115652 some canadian newspapers tried to link the phrase soviet canuckistan to a website run by a racist and holocaust denier
1115653 his reference to canada as a soviet canuckistan apparently has some sinister origins its a term frequently used by american holocaust denier eric thomson on his web site thirdworldplanet com a virulently racist and anti semitic site
1115654 you could never resist glorifying despair well now its coming to you and i dont really care
1115655 this is part of the fall offensive along with the attacks in kuwait and off the coast of yemen
1115656 the discovery that the weapon used in the washington area sniper attacks was also used to kill an atlanta man on sept
1115657 yes the main adult suspect in the killings is a man named john muhammad but robbery and mayhem not politics seem to have been his motivation if that makes him an islamic terrorist then timothy mcveigh was a christian terrorist and david berkowitz the son of sam killer was a jewish terrorist
1115658 tried to depict muhammad as part of the great islamic dagger aimed at the heart and soul of america
1115659 the guiding presumption must be that they see themselves as warriors in a jihad against the great satan
1115660 it doesnt matter whether they were acting on orders or simply improvising
1115661 four legs good two legs bad such is the ideology of the pigs in animal farm democracy good all else bad such is the democratist ideology a politicized american army operating abroad would be no more popular soon than the red army has been an imposed or induced abstract democracy thrust upon peoples unprepared for it would produce at first anarchy and then as in nearly all of emergent africa over the past four decades rule by force and a master
1115662 neoconservatives demands nowadays that all the world be thoroughly democratized overnight remind me strongly of a similar enthusiasm not long after the end of the second world war gentlemen such as chester bowles then proclaimed that africa liberated from european domination promptly would rejoice in an array of democracies on the american model the united states took measures then and later to accelerate this happy progress economic restraints upon trade of one sort or another with portugal rhodesia and latterly the republic of south africa we all know of course how blissfully democratic angola mozambique guinea and rhodesia now zimbabwe are today
1115663 caesarism slipped into the white house constitutionally if not naturally with the murder of president kennedy in 1963 the plebiscitary democracy would elect lyndon johnson president in 1964 but johnsons military failure would undo him despite his panem et circenses and a rebellious senator would strip him of the purple if caesars do not win their battles they fall in this although not in much else perhaps it was as well that the war in vietnam was lost
1115664 on a wall of my library hangs a photograph of myself with president johnson both of us are smiling it is well to be civil to caesar it might be thought that russell kirk would not have been eager to visit caesar in the oval office of the imperial mansion indeed i was not
1115665 unless measures of restraint should be taken riencourt wrote and taken promptly the united states would fall under the domination of 20 th century caesars
1115666 with caesarism and civilization the great struggles between political parties are no longer concerned with principles programs and ideologies but with men marius sulla cato brutus still fought for principles but now everything became personalized under augustus parties still existed but there were no more optimates or populares no more conservatives or democrats men campaigned for or against tiberius or drusus or caius caesar no one believed any more in the efficacy of ideas political panaceas doctrines or systems just as the greeks had given up building great philosophic systems generations before abstractions ideas and philosophies were rejected to the periphery of their lives and of the empire to the east where jews agnostics christians and mithraists attempted to conquer the world of souls and minds while the caesars ruled their material existence
1115667 an idea and it is of the essence of this idea that it is also a conspiracy to subvert every social and political order it does not dominate
1115668 plain truth is that south vietnam like south korea is barely capable of decent self government under the best of conditions it lacks the political traditions the educated classes the civic spirit that makes self government workable no amount of american aid no amount of exhortation no amount of good advice can change this basic condition the most we can hope for in south vietnam is what we have achieved in south korea that is to remove this little backward nation from the front line of the cold war so that it can stew quietly in its own political juice
1115669 communism soon completes its demise u s foreign policy still should make the promotion of democracy its main objective
1115670 monitoring and maintaining a balance of power among other nations large and small in europe the middle east asia and elsewhere would make the united states the worlds policeman we are simply not going to be that kind of imperial power
1115671 not only to liberals but to many conservatives who are ideologically adrift in the post cold war era
1115672 a framework of stability and moderation within which democratic institutions may take root and grow
1115673 find opportunities to use it or the world will discover them for it
1115674 barring extraordinary events the united states will always feel obliged to defend if possible a democratic nation under attack from nondemocratic forces external or internal that is why it was in our national interest to come to the defense of france and britain in world war ii that is why we feel it necessary to defend israel today when its survival is threatened no complicated geopolitical calculations of national interest are necessary behind all this is a fact the incredible military superiority of the united states vis vis the nations of the rest of the world in any imaginable combination this superiority was planned by no one and even today there are many americans who are in denial the older traditional elements in the republican party have difficulty coming to terms with this new reality in foreign affairs just as they cannot reconcile economic conservatism with social and cultural conservatism but by one of those accidents historians ponder our current president and his administration turn out to be quite at home in this new political environment although it is clear they did not anticipate this role any more than their party as a whole did as a result neoconservatism began enjoying a second life at a time when its obituaries were still being published
1115675 recruit a new country manager for iraq despite concerns over staff security there as well as the banks attempts in may 2007 to suppress reports about an incident in which a bank employee was injured in baghdad apparently to avoid derailing his recruitment efforts have lent credence to critics charges that he has been more than eager to line up the institution and its resources behind u s policy there
1115676 impression that at critical moments wolfowitz was putting american foreign policy interests first
1115677 a program in uzbekistan after the country denied landing rights to american military aircraft
1115678 directed huge amounts of aid to the countries he once recruited to sign on to washingtons counterterrorism agenda and relied heavily on a pair of aides drawn from the bush administration robin cleveland and kevin kellems who created an inner circle that the banks professional staff members said they had great trouble piercing
1115679 of the top five outside international appointments made by wolfowitz during his nearly two year tenure three were senior political appointees of right wing governments that provided strong backing for u s policy in iraq
1115680 in an internal e mail the banks team leader for madagascar indicated that one of two managing directors appointed by wolfowitz ordered the removal of all references to family planning from a document laying out strategy for the african nation and a draft of the banks long term health program strategy overseen by the same official makes almost no mention of family planning suggesting a wider rollback may be under way
1115681 to me this sounds like a storm in a glass of water there is no reason understandable for this
1115682 theres mismanagement there wolfowitz appointed a guy in a very high position who felt free to censor in line with his personal beliefs i think thats good grounds for sacking
1115683 fails to take into account both the deep roots of this problem and the nature of the economic crisis in which many african countries find themselves after decades of world bank and international monetary fund involvement
1115684 attempts by the world bank to renege on earlier promises of debt cancellation by citing concerns over corruption represent a blatant abuse of creditor power they also reveal a short memory about that institutions own role in fostering corruption in african countries these debts are illegitimate and odious they continue to have a devastating impact on africas people and they should be written off immediately and without creditor imposed conditions
1115685 the worlds poorest people the 1 2 billion living on less than 1 a day are counting on your good intentions being transformed into decisive action
1115686 he has been a visionary were very grateful for his leadership in getting where we are today we look forward to that continuing
1115687 if sending arch unilateralist john bolton to the united nations sent a message of contempt for multilateralism what does u s president george w bush mean by sending that ardent advocate of hard power paul wolfowitz to the planets single biggest purveyor of soft power the world bank
1115688 its not quite like john bolton going to the un but youre going to get someone whos really devoted to the presidents agenda the world bank could be a useful tool of american statecraft that would be great
1115689 the crowd booed wolfowitz bushs representative to the rally when he told them that innocent palestinians are suffering and dying in great numbers
1115690 passion for the noble goals of the iraq war might overwhelm the prudence and pragmatism that normally guide war planners wolfowitz didnt answer directly except to say that it was a good question
1115691 wolfowitz is a serious and thoughtful person who is genuinely interested in the promotion of democracy and human rights around the world and someone who understands that very few interests can be advanced without paying attention to the way people are being governed
1115692 a drum that would not stop he and his group of neoconservatives were rubbing their hands over the ideas for invading iraq
1115693 only strong advocate for attacking iraq he worried about 100 000 american troops bogged down in the notoriously treacherous mountains six months from then in contrast iraq was a brittle oppressive regime that might break easily with an opposition yearning to topple saddam he estimated that there was a 10 50 chance saddam was involved in the 9 11 attacks
1115694 the truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the u s government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason
1115695 but there have always been three fundamental concerns one is weapons of mass destruction the second is support for terrorism the third is the criminal treatment of the iraqi people actually i guess you could say theres a fourth overriding one which is the connection between the first two
1115696 whereas the nazis waged a war for german domination of europe ayatollah khomeini looked forward to a war that would spread islamic rule throughout the middle east and beyond
1115697 khomeinis successors may soon have not just swords but also nuclear weapons to help them pursue their vision osama bin ladens ambitions are the same though he dreams of sunni rather than shiite sheiks ordering infidels to convert or die
1115698 ideological heir to the enemy america confronted in world war ii and is at least as serious a threat
1115699 today post 9 11 we find ourselves in a similar existential struggle but with a different enemy not soviet communism but arab islamic totalitarianism both secular and religious
1115700 almost every conflict in which the united states has been engaged since the late 1960s from vietnam to central america to yugoslavia to the war on terror in iraq and against al qaida has been portrayed as a new munich in which the enemy represents a threat virtually on a par with hitler
1115701 a group of visionary philanthropists and policymakers to engage in the worldwide war of ideas and to support the defense of democratic societies under assault by terrorism and militant islamism
1115702 one of the worlds leading public relations and communications management firms
1115703 liberal democracy should be spread across the world that as the worlds most powerful democracies the united states and the european union under british leadership must shape the world more actively by intervention and example that such leadership requires political will a commitment to universal human rights and the maintenance of a strong military with global expeditionary reach and that too few of our leaders in britain and the rest of europe today are ready to play a role in the world that matches our strength and responsibilities
1115704 that wasnt news to me i had been told that but not by anyone working in the white house rather i learned it from someone who formerly worked in the government and he mentioned it in an offhand manner leading me to infer that it was something that insiders were well aware of
1115705 from the moment he stood on the rubble of the world trade center president bush has demonstrated that he understands the nature of the threat facing our country and the entire free world
1115706 we stand behind the president in his commitment his determination to defend freedom and defeat the enemies of democratic societies
1115707 the foundation is making a difference across the world and i appreciate the difference youre making you have trained iraqi women and iranian students in the principles and practice of democracy youve translated democracy readers into arabic for distribution across the broader middle east youve helped activists across the region organize effective political movements so they can help bring about democratic change and ensure the survival of liberty in new democracies by promoting democratic ideals and training a new generation of democratic leaders in the middle east you are helping us to bring victory in the war on terror and i thank you for your hard work in freedoms cause
1115708 i would say the criticism should focus on how the job in iraq could get done better it shouldnt focus on rumsfeld the man and calling for his scalp
1115709 the un will fail at this because its failed at every similar mission it has ever undertaken in its entire history
1115710 once his own fling with sixties radicalism ended podhoretz launched a scorched earth campaign against the new left and counterculture from his editorial command post at commentary podhoretz did much to create and refine the fiercely combative neoconservative style that style emphasized not balance viewed as evidence of timidity or the careful sifting of evidence suggesting scholasticism but the ruthless demolition of any point of view inconsistent with the neoconservative version of truth typically portrayed as self evident and beyond dispute
1115711 the survival not only of the united states but of free institutions everywhere in the world depends on a resurgence of american power
1115712 once one starts using imagery from that most extreme of events it becomes impossible to say anything moderate balanced or nuanced the very language carries you along to hyperbole anyone who scoffed at the idea that there were dangerous portents in american society had not learned the lessons of the holocaust
1115713 in a world full of ambiguities and puzzlements one thing is absolutely easy both to define and locate that is the jewish interest the continued security and in those happy places where the term applies well being of the jews worldwide rests with a strong vital prosperous self confident united states
1115714 america and israel shared a common ideological struggle against common enemies the 1970s saw the vague consensus of neoconservatism wrap itself tightly around the belief that america must have a self assured and robust elite which must be willing to employ u s power promptly and resolutely if need be and prepared to stand up to the ussr along with its anti american and anti semitic allies at the un and beyond
1115715 the soviet program of indefinite expansion achieved by the aggressive use of force is still the central problem of world politics and american national security
1115716 it is an instrument through which gorbachev can consolidate his own power by using the press to indict and little by little eliminate his predecessors men
1115717 we need to accept responsibility for americas unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security our prosperity and our principles
1115718 we are only in the very early stages of what promises to be a very long war and iraq is only the second front to have been opened in that war the second scene so to speak of the first act of a five act play in world war ii and then in world war iii the cold war we persisted in spite of impatience discouragement and opposition for as long as it took to win and this is exactly what we have been called upon to do today in world war iv
1115719 for today no less than in those titanic conflicts we are up against a truly malignant force in radical islamism and in the states breeding sheltering or financing its terrorist armory this new enemy has already attacked us on our own soil a feat neither nazi germany nor soviet russia ever managed to pull off and openly announces his intention to hit us again only this time with weapons of infinitely greater and deadlier power than those used on 9 11 his objective is not merely to murder as many of us as possible and to conquer our land like the nazis and communists before him he is dedicated to the destruction of everything good for which america stands
1115720 the thoughtful observer of islamic terrorism will experience a certain gratitude for a providence which by providing the american people with this implacable challenge has made their entire security as a nation dependent on their pulling themselves together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear
1115721 a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes american principles abroad and national leadership that accepts the united states global responsibilities
1115722 they wished for a military posture approaching mobilization they would create or invent whatever crises were required to bring this about
1115723 some not insignificant number of people always assume that the weekly standard isnt really published in english but in code that its contents are designed to advance a surreptitious political agenda the weekly standard is a conservative magazine of course we make no bones about it and ours tends toward a particular kind of conservatism our pages are its home we like to think
1115724 become part of washingtons circulatory system this half pol half pundit full throated advocate with the nice guy image
1115725 wisdom of regime change the merits of promoting democracy the desirability of american power and influence these issues extend well beyond iraq so we dare to hope that this work will prove useful even after baghdad is finally free
1115726 benevolent global hegemony having defeated the evil empire the united states enjoys strategic and ideological predominance the first objective of u s foreign policy should be to preserve and enhance that predominance by strengthening americas security supporting its friends advancing its interests and standing up for its principles around the world
1115727 overall strategy for containing influencing and ultimately seeking to change the regime in beijing
1115728 it is time once again to challenge an indifferent america and a confused american conservatism
1115729 in a world in which peace and american security depend on american power and the will to use it the main threat the united states faces now and in the future is its own weakness american hegemony is the only reliable defense against a breakdown of peace and international order the appropriate goal of american foreign policy therefore is to preserve that hegemony as far into the future as possible
1115730 in order to preserve the cosmic harmony it seems the gods insist that good news in one place be offset by misfortune elsewhere it may well be that gen david petraeus is going to lead us to victory in iraq he is certainly off to a good start if the karmic price of success in iraq is utter embarrassment for senior bush officials in washington dc well in our judgment the trade off is worth it the world will surely note our success or failure in iraq it will not long remember the gang that couldnt shoot straight at the justice department or for that matter the antics of congressional democrats unless either so weakens the administration as to undercut our mission in iraq
1115731 small aggressive states armed with weapons of mass destruction and possessing the means to deliver them
1115732 will constitute the greatest single threat to world security for the rest of our lives
1115733 admirable commitment to lead the world to victory in the war against terrorism
1115734 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism
1115735 israel has been and remains americas staunchest ally against international terrorism especially in the middle east the united states should fully support our fellow democracy in its fight against terrorism
1115736 to begin looking now with unflinching honesty at the military option
1115737 in the region persian iran will immediately become the hegemonic power in the arab middle east today it is deterred from overt aggression against its neighbors by the threat of conventional retaliation against a nuclear iran such deterrence becomes far less credible as its weak non nuclear persian gulf neighbors accommodate to it jihadist iran will gain control of the most strategic region on the globe then there is the larger danger of permitting nuclear weapons to be acquired by religious fanatics seized with an eschatological belief in the imminent apocalypse and in their own divine duty to hasten the end of days the mullahs are infinitely more likely to use these weapons than anyone in the history of the nuclear age every city in the civilized world will live under the specter of instant annihilation delivered either by missile or by terrorist
1115738 america finds itself at war with radical islam a two churched monster sunni al qaida is now being challenged by shiite iran for primacy in its epic confrontation with the infidel west with al qaida in decline iran is on the march it is intervening through proxies throughout the arab world hezbollah in lebanon hamas in palestine moqtada mahdi army in iraq to subvert modernizing western oriented arab governments and bring these territories under iranian hegemony its nuclear ambitions would secure these advances give it an overwhelming preponderance of power over the arabs and an absolute deterrent against serious counteractions by the united states israel or any other rival
1115739 another symptom of the absurd political correctness surrounding islamic radicalism
1115740 we are all supposed to pretend that we have equal suspicions of terrorist intent and thus must give equal scrutiny to a 70 year old irish nun a 50 year old jewish seminarian and a 30 year old man from saudi arabia your daughter is on that plane to whom do you want the security guards to give their attention president bush is considering bypassing the senate and giving pipes a recess appointment while congress is out of town for bush this would be an act of characteristic principle and courage the problem however is that such an act makes the appointment look furtive worse it lets the mccarthyites off too easy
1115741 scooter libby has just been convicted of four felonies that could theoretically give him 25 years in jail for what misstating when he first heard a certain piece of information namely the identity of joe wilsons wife think about that can you remember when you first heard the name joe wilson or valerie plame okay so it is not a preoccupation of yours but it was a preoccupation of many washington journalists and government officials called to testify at the libby trial and their memories were all over the lot former presidential press secretary ari fleischer testified under oath that he had not told post reporter walter pincus about mrs wilson pincus testified under oath that fleischer definitely had obviously one is not telling the truth but there is no reason to believe that either one is deliberately lying pincus and fleischer are as fallible as any of us they spend their days receiving and giving information they cant possibly be expected to remember not only every piece but precisely when they received every piece should scooter libby
1115742 the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq the virulent and steadily mounting anti americanism throughout the middle east the growing insurgency in iraq the fact that no strong democratic leadership had emerged there the enormous financial and growing human cost of the war the failure to leverage the war to make progress on the israeli palestinian front and the fact that americas fellow democratic allies had by and large failed to fall in line and legitimate american actions ex post
1115743 the failure to step up to these facts is dangerous precisely to the neo neoconservative position that krauthammer has been seeking to define and justify as the war in iraq turns from triumphant liberation to grinding insurgency other voices either traditional realists like brent scowcroft nationalist isolationists like patrick buchanan or liberal internationalists like john kerry will step forward as authoritative voices and will have far more influence in defining american post iraq war foreign policy the poorly executed nation building strategy in iraq will poison the well for future such exercises undercutting domestic political support for a generous and visionary internationalism just as vietnam did
1115744 in 1978 he quit psychiatry and came to washington to serve as a science adviser in the carter administration and later speechwriter to vice president walter mondale in 1981 he joined the staff of the new republic where he was an essayist and editor from 1981 1988 in the mid eighties he began writing a weekly syndicated column for the washington post which now appears in more than 100 newspapers and a monthly essay for time magazine in his first full year as a syndicated columnist he won the pulitzer prize distinguished commentary 1987 his new republic essays won the highest award in magazine writing the national magazine award for essays and criticism 1984 his essays have appeared in dozens of anthologies on subjects ranging from nuclear deterrence to gay marriage a collection of his essays and columns cutting edges was published in 1985 random house
1115745 i am extremely excited to be the next leader of the colorado 14ers it is a fantastic time for both the developmental league and the 14ers as the league continues to evolve
1115746 this is a great opportunity for myself and my family to be with one of the model franchises and to be part of the great community of broomfield within the denver boulder area we look forward to putting down roots and having a long exciting and successful run with the 14ers
1115747 after a national search of almost 40 impressive candidates bob mackinnons name and qualifications kept coming to the forefront i believe bob is the kind of man and coach that will keep the 14ers in the community and take the team to greater success
1115748 bob is an excellent coach and will do a wonderful job our organization looks forward to working with him as we anticipate the possibility of having players in colorado
1115749 bob mackinnons resume is rich in basketball history with his father being a longtime nba coach and gm he has literally grown up in the game and has a terrific reputation as both a solid basketball coach and team ambassador the nuggets look forward to working with bob
1115750 bob mackinnon has been a successful coach at every many different levels and i would expect him to be just as successful as the coach of the d leagues 14ers the 14ers are fortunate to have hired a coach with bob mackinnons experience and pedigree nobody will work harder nor put in more hours than bob mackinnon bob mackinnon has dedicated his life to the game of basketball and will be a huge asset to the 14ers franchise and the community broomfield
1115751 ive known bob mackinnon for over 30 years he is a great basketball professional he is passionate for the game he has the ability to deal with a wide variety of situations and maintain focus he is a terrific source of knowledge and he is a great addition to the 14ers and the league
1115752 bob will be thorough in his approach to the game he will be a tremendous leader he will be an asset to the community
1115753 bob mackinnon is outstanding coach that will be a great asset to the colorado 14ers he is one of the most thorough coaches in his preparation for games and his ability to develop players his personality will be contagious for the team organization and the surrounding community
1115754 bob is a great choice he comes from a strong basketball family and i have known them for a long time his father was the one who drafted me when i was at buffalo
1115755 coach mackinnon has great knowledge and experience of the game his strong suit is his background of developing players having coached at college basketballs highest level and most recently worked as a scout in the nba for the la lakers makes him a great choice for the 14ers bob is a very good coach and even a better person who is respected throughout the world of basketball
1115756 bob mackinnon is a first class gentleman of high integrity he is highly respected by everyone that i know who has had the pleasure of working with him i have seen him in action both on and off the court as a coach and a leader and there is no question that he knows what he is doing bob possesses a great love for the game of basketball and he will prove to be a great asset to both the colorado 14ers and the national basketball association development league
1115757 bob will breathe great energy into that team i have always been impressed with how great a communicator he is they are in for some special things
1115758 you have the right person for the job he will work extremely hard and the results will be very good
1115759 ending ataturks experiment and restoring the muslim caliphate it supplanted has long been a goal of islamofascists adherents to a dangerous political movement whose global reach and terrorist methods have largely been enabled by decades of investment by the worlds repressive islamist regimes led by saudi arabia the rise of islamofascism has prompted some in the west to hope that turkey would continue to serve as a model for the muslim world even after an avowed islamist named recep tayyip erdogan in 2002 parlayed a minority of votes into a monopoly of power this delusion contributed to the european union allowing its negotiations for turkish accession to the eu to be skillfully used by erdogan to checkmate turkeys military
1115760 it behooves the european union to reinforce the political impact of such sentiment by making clear that islamofascist behavior will be what precludes turkey from being eligible for membership not efforts by the turkish military to counter the islamists takeover and the united states and other freedom loving nations must make clear that they view an islamist turkey as no model for the muslim world and a threat to that nations standing as a valued member of the free one
1115761 promoting pluralism defending democratic values and fighting the ideologies that drive terrorism
1115762 what we need is the dominos pizza of the policy business
1115763 if you dont get your policy analysis in 30 minutes you get your money back
1115764 prides itself on being loosely modeled on the committee on the present danger
1115765 an organization for our time whose lean agile organizational structure enables the center to bring to todays debate what we call precision guided ideas
1115766 and a clear eyed assessment of the abiding soviet and other challenges that dictate a continued robust defense posture
1115767 beyond compiling an a list of influential conservative hawks gaffney has been prolific over the past 15 years churning out a constant stream of reports as well as regular columns for the
1115768 precisely whom the war is being waged against depends on the week but since the centers founding in 1988 the enemy has included the soviet union and its real or suspected allies china the oslo peace process arabs especially palestinians the united nations and the law of the sea in particular anyone opposed to ever bigger defense budgets and expensive if unworkable missile defense programs and most recently islamofascists from al qaida to saudi arabia and the uae to iran
1115769 makes clear that the war is about much more than iraq and afghanistan
1115770 i believe that when you find as you will i hope shortly that the iraqi people welcome the end of this horrible regime even if it comes at some further expense to themselves knowing as they do that the alternative is more of the horror that theyve lived under for the past two or three decades ah youll see i think an outpouring of appreciation for their liberation that will make what we saw in afghanistan recently pale by comparison youll see moreover evidence in the files and the bunkers that become available to our military evidence not only of saddams weapons of mass destruction programs and his future ambitions for their use perhaps and for aggression against his neighbors but also i would be willing to bet evidence of his past complicity with acts of terror against the west perhaps more generally but certainly against the united states which in turn i think will further vindicate the course of action that this president is courageously embarked upon
1115771 well i think one simply has to look at what the soviets actually did and what they had what they were building what they were planning to see that in fact the team b assessment was vastly more accurate in its depiction of all of that than was an assessment that they had a huge economy they were not devoting much of it to military activities the activities were not terribly threatening they did not anticipate or desire to meet let alone exceed our military capabilities and the like which was the sort of standard fare of the time in the intelligence community as i recall
1115772 prime minister ehud olmert needs to know that americans will not support let alone finance such an action that would threaten the future survival of both israel and the hashemite kingdom of jordan endanger the effort to consolidate the liberation of iraq and create a new safe haven from which islamofascist terrorists will be able to plot and launch attacks against the united states
1115773 is working toward a capability that could destroy america as we know it

1115804 ik heb uitvoerig met ruud gesproken en ik wil en kan niet anders dan zijn besluit respecteren natuurlijk vind ik het spijtig dat ik bij het samenstellen van de oranjeselectie geen beroep kan doen op zijn kwaliteiten en internationale ervaring
1115805 nadat ik de programmas van real madrid en het nederlands elftal nog eens goed had bestudeerd kwam het besef dat ik gezien de vereiste fysieke inspanning om op dit niveau maximaal te presteren een keuze moest maken

1115815 they argued that this increase in regulation should be on the next presidents record

1115843 we will request a warrant of arrest and the judges have to evaluate the evidence

1115845 bashir will certainly use the indictment to justify some awful reactions such as humanitarian aid restrictions and further barriers
1115846 but if the international community stands firm and makes it clear that these kinds of responses will only make matters worse for bashir then he will relent

1115923 i just heard from dr tom laughren head of psychiatry products he said that dr wozniak is correct the fda does accept the validity of pediatric bipolar disorder as evidenced by our issuing written requests for pediatric studies for this disorder and approving both risperdal and abilify for use in pediatric bipolar disorder
1115924 explain to me as if i was a 6 years old child
1115925 the fda approvals of risperdal and abilify for this purpose not only suggest that at the proper dose these atypical antipsychotic medications are safe and effective for use as indicated but affirm that the fda accepts the validity of pediatric bipolar disorder and the need to treat it
1115926 when patients suffer and available treatments are lacking it is the job of experts to innovate and explore new options for hope families faced with the anguish and disruption of bipolar disorder need reassurance that steady progress is being made in understanding and treating this complex diagnosis

1115931 sua juventude anterior parecia lhe estranha como uma doen a de vida dela havia aos poucos emergido para descobrir que tamb m sem a felicidade se vivia abolindo a encontrara uma legi o de pessoas antes invis veis que viviam como quem trabalha com persist ncia continuidade alegria
1115932 abolindo a incerteza e a emo o restava apenas o cotidiano no qual ela mergulhara para
1115933 ela plantara as sementes que tinha na m o n o outras mas essas apenas e cresciam rvores crescia sua r pida conversa com o cobrador de luz crescia a gua enchendo o tanque cresciam seus filhos crescia a mesa com comidas o marido chegando com os jornais e sorrindo de fome o canto importuno das empregadas do edif cio ana dava a tudo tranq ilamente sua m o pequena e forte sua corrente de vida
1115934 no fundo ana sempre tivera necessidade de sentir a raiz firme das coisas e isso um lar perplexamente lhe dera por caminhos tortos viera a cair num destino de mulher com a surpresa de nele caber como se o tivesse inventado o homem com quem casara era um homem verdadeiro os filhos que tivera eram filhos verdadeiros
1115935 mas na sua vida n o havia lugar para que sentisse ternura pelo seu espanto ela o abafava com a mesma habilidade que as lides em casa lhe haviam transmitido sa a ent o para fazer compras ou levar objetos para consertar cuidando do lar e da fam lia revelia deles quando voltasse era o fim da tarde e as crian as vindas do col gio exigiam na assim chegaria a noite com sua tranq ila vibra o e alimentava anonimamente a vida estava bom assim
1115936 ela seria a soma integral das realiza es e regulamentos que distinguem nossas vidas das de nossos antepassados e animais e que servem a dois intuitos a saber o de proteger os homens contra a natureza e o de ajustar os seus relacionamentos m tuos
1115937 certa hora da tarde era mais perigosa certa hora da tarde as rvores que plantara riam dela quando nada mais precisava de sua for a inquietava se
1115938 foi ent o que olhou para o homem parado no ponto a diferen a entre ele e os outros que ele estava realmente parado de p suas m os se mantinham avan adas era um cego
1115939 incapaz de se mover para apanhar suas compras ana se aprumava p lida uma express o de rosto h muito n o usada ressurgira lhe com dificuldade ainda incerta incompreens vel
1115940 o que chamara de crise viera afinal e sua marca era o prazer intenso com que olhava agora as coisas sofrendo espantada o calor se tornara mais abafado tudo tinha ganho uma for a e vozes mais altas
1115941 ela apaziguara t o bem a vida cuidara tanto para que esta n o explodisse mantinha tudo em serena compreens o separava uma pessoa das outras as roupas eram claramente feitas para serem usadas e podia se escolher pelo jornal o filme da noite tudo feito de modo a que um dia se seguisse ao outro e um cego mascando goma despeda ava tudo isso e atrav s da piedade aparecia a ana uma vida cheia de n usea doce at a boca
1115942 s ent o percebeu que h muito passara do seu ponto de descida na fraqueza em que estava tudo a atingia com um susto desceu do bonde com pernas d beis olhou em torno de si segurando a rede suja de ovo por um momento n o conseguia orientar se parecia ter saltado no meio da noite
1115943 a vastid o parecia acalm la o sil ncio regulava sua respira o ela adormecia dentro de si de longe via a al ia onde a tarde era clara e redonda mas a penumbra dos ramos cobria o atalho ao seu redor havia ru dos serenos cheiro de rvores pequenas surpresas entre os cip s todo o jardim triturado pelos instantes mais apressados da tarde de onde vinha o meio sonho pelo qual estava rodeada como por um zunido de abelhas e aves tudo era estranho suave demais grande demais
1115944 inquieta olhou em torno os ramos se balan avam as sombras vacilavam no ch o um pardal ciscava a terra e de repente com mal estar pareceu lhe ter ca do numa emboscada fazia se no jardim um trabalho secreto do qual ela come ava a se aperceber
1115945 um estado de sentimento imparcialmente suspenso constante e afetuoso que tem pouca semelhan a com as tempestuosas agita es do amor genital
1115946 a crueza do mundo era tranq ila o assassinato era profundo e a morte n o era o que pens vamos
1115947 ao mesmo tempo que imagin rio era um mundo de se comer com os dentes um mundo de volumosas d lias e tulipas os troncos eram percorridos por parasitas folhudas o abra o era macio colado como a repulsa que precedesse uma entrega era fascinante a mulher tinha nojo e era fascinante as rvores estavam carregadas o mundo era t o rico que apodrecia quando ana pensou que havia crian as e homens grandes com fome a n usea subiu lhe garganta como se ela estivesse gr vida e abandonada
1115948 mas todas as pesadas coisas ela via com a cabe a rodeada por um enxame de insetos enviados pela vida mais fina do mundo a brisa se insinuava entre as flores ana mais adivinhava que sentia seu cheiro adocicado o jardim era t o bonito que ela teve medo do inferno
1115949 mas quando se lembrou das crian as diante das quais se tornara culpada ergueu se com uma exclama o de dor agarrou o embrulho avan ou pelo atalho escuro atingiu a alameda quase correndo e via o jardim em torno de si com sua impersonalidade soberba sacudiu os port es fechados sacudia os segurando a madeira spera o vigia apareceu espantado de n o a ter visto enquanto n o chegou porta do edif cio parecia beira de um desastre correu com a rede at o elevador sua alma batia lhe no peito o que sucedia
1115950 n o havia como fugir os dias que ela forjara haviam se rompido na crosta e a gua escapava estava diante da ostra e n o havia como n o olh la de que tinha vergonha que j n o era mais piedade n o era s piedade seu cora o se enchera com a pior vontade de viver
1115951 com horror descobria que pertencia parte forte do mundo e que nome se deveria dar sua miseric rdia violenta seria obrigada a beijar o leproso pois nunca seria apenas sua irm um cego me levou ao pior de mim mesma pensou espantada sentia se banida porque nenhum pobre beberia gua nas suas m os ardentes ah era mais f cil ser um santo do que uma pessoa por deus pois n o fora verdadeira a piedade que sondara no seu cora o as guas mais profundas mas era uma piedade de le o
1115952 mas a vida arrepiava a como um frio as gotas d gua ca am na gua parada do tanque os besouros de ver o o horror dos besouros inexpressivos ao redor havia uma vida silenciosa lenta insistente horror horror
1115953 humilhada sabia que o cego preferiria um amor mais pobre e estremecendo tamb m sabia por que a vida no jardim bot nico chamava a como um lobisomem chamado pelo luar oh mas ela amava o cego pensou com os olhos molhados no entanto n o era com este sentimento que se iria a uma igreja estou com medo disse sozinha na sala
1115954 uma noite em que a piedade era t o crua como o amor ruim entre os dois seios escorria o suor a f a quebrantava o calor do forno ardia nos seus olhos
1115955 depois o marido veio vieram os irm os e suas mulheres vieram os filhos dos irm os jantaram com as janelas todas abertas no nono andar depois do jantar enfim a primeira brisa mais fresca entrou pelas janelas eles rodeavam a mesa a fam lia cansados do dia felizes em n o discordar t o dispostos a n o ver defeitos riam de tudo com o cora o bom e humano as crian as cresciam admiravelmente em torno deles e como a uma borboleta ana prendeu o instante entre os dedos antes que ele nunca mais fosse seu

1115959 they have discovered water on mars for the third or fourth time
1115960 the goal of having no meca team members present was to prevent them from being asked any questions that could reveal information before nasa is ready to make an announcement sources say
1115961 the bush administrations presidential science advisors office however has been briefed on the new information that nasa hopes to release as early as mid august
1115962 not true meca results have not been discussed at the white house
1115963 there is no one who knows either on the phoenix project in tucson or at nasa hq who knows where this information came from
1115964 they had nothing new to report the story was about water ice
1115965 note the aviation week story said very very clearly three times or so no life on mars detected and phoenix can not detect life in the first place
1115966 we are attempting to assess the chemicals and minerals that make up the soil composition
1115967 we are now about half way through the process and there are several conflicting points of view this is not a good time to go public with half the story

1115978 we dont even know if they have the gold there anymore
1115979 yet as noted above over a three year period of the drugs use off label and for autism there are 195 adverse events reports more than were even in the clinical trials if i were a doctor id use the term safe very carefully a lawyer might ask you what you mean by that term someday
1115980 if we continue down the path we are on we are liable to arrive where we are headed
1115981 a distinction should also be drawn between the use of drugs to manage a discreet serious event and so called prophylactic you need to take this for life usage the former may indeed carry a worthy benefit risk ratio however i think it can be definitely show the latter carries an unacceptable risk id further venture that most psychotropics should only be used in the rarest and most extreme circumstances because the efficacy potential is so low and the risks are really unacceptable ofr any other use
1115982 nice job not citing the rate of adverse events as a function of the number of total prescriptions 442 pediatric adverse events for abilify for example means nothing without knowing how many kids were given abilify during that same period of time
1115983 hey that ted bundy fellow isnt all that bad because he didnt rape all of the women he dated
1115984 it is a shame you have such a one sided view in these commentaries as you raise valid issues i cant in good faith participate further but ill read on and direct others to read your postings just also advise them to read the threads at their own risk
1115985 this line of reasoning seems to be the consensus of the folks who find fault with philip for this piece their only weak argument
1115986 since the side effects of the drugs and the symptoms of the purported disease are almost identical itd be impossible to tell anyway

1115992 holy cow i got one that is circumsized uncircumsized i havent seen one of those in years
1115993 any analysis of the actual frequency of adverse events is complicated by the problem of under reporting inherent in a voluntary reporting system such as the fda aers under estimation of the frequency of actual events causes an under estimation of the risks associated with a given drug based on spontaneous reporting alone estimates of the extent of under reporting vary usually ranging from 1 to 10 and the reporting itself may be subject to biases relating to reporting environment length of time on the market and quality of data in light of these limitations it should be understood that the reports discussed in this petition represent an extremely conservative estimate of the true magnitude of the risks discussed
1115994 it is generally believed that the number of reports is much smaller than the actual number of events
1115995 yi tsong ph d is currently a mathematical statistician of quantitative methods and research staff of cder fda he specializes in postmarketing risk assessment and quality assurance he received cder and fda level awards for contributions in postmarketing drug risk assessment for advisory on cder postmarketing risk assessment external contracts medication errors quality control evaluation drug compliance in vitro bioequivalence adaptive design and non inferiority tests dr tsong is currently the president elected 2006 of icsa he received his ph d in mathematical statistics from the univ of north carolina chapel hill in 1979
1115996 conclusions the extent of reporting of adverse events to fda varied by statin and may be influenced by publicity for statins associated rhabdomyolysis the estimated extent of reporting appears to range from 5 30 but in the absence of stimulated reporting appears to be 5 15

1116000 as far as im concerned please refer yourself to answer 768 646 12 an 327
1116001 i have my son and two other sons only children in their twenties killed by zyprexa
1116002 the adverse events dont matter because theyre just side effects argument
1116003 i find it strange that in regard to homicide there were 142 reports of this occurring on antidepressants for the three year period and only 32 reports of homicides happening while on the antipsychotics all 32 of which happened on the atypical antipsychotics which are half antidepressant and half antipsychotic so there it is the antidepressants in particular the ssris and snris are linked to homicide
1116004 ib your argument is of course the primary defense for all drug companies regardless of whether the med attacked is a childs drug or not eli lilly used it in arguing that its not that zyprexa causes diabetes but that people who have the recently determined to be nonexistent schizophrenia gene also have the diabetes gene so diabetes and schizophrenia are linked
1116005 g del mistrusted our ability to communicate natural language he thought was imprecise and we usually dont understand each other g del wanted to prove a mathematical theorem that would have all the precision of mathematics the only language with any claims to precision but with the sweep of philosophy he wanted a mathematical theorem that would speak to the issues of meta mathematics and two extraordinary things happened one is that he actually did produce such a theorem the other is that it was interpreted by the jazzier parts of the intellectual culture as saying philosophically exactly the opposite of what he had been intending to say with it

1116009 as far as how difficult it is to pull useful and balanced material out of the available literature public and scientific tough quit whining about it dig in and get to work
1116010 an ordinary citizen would presume that just the opposite would happen

1116012 tahun 2009 targetnya 66 6 persen penduduk indonesia memiliki akses air bersih
1116013 di jakarta utara jumlah balita yang terkena diare lebih banyak dibandingkan di menteng karena penduduk jakarta utara banyak yang tak mampu mengakses air bersih
1116014 bukan hanya pemerintah tapi juga pemerintah daerah pun harus memikirkan akses air bersih untuk masyarakat
1116015 fe valensi muatan 2 dapat larut sehingga berapapun tidak akan menimbulkan kekeruhan tapi kalau sudah kontak dengan udara akan terjadi oksidasi menjadi valensi 3 endapannya akan menimbulkan warna kekuning kuningan pada air kalau mn juga sama dengan fe pada valensi 2 dapat larut tapi bila kontak dengan udara akan menjadi valensi 4 pada air akan menimbulkan warna cokelat
1116016 cara yang sederhana buat menara air yang penuh dengan lubang pipa kecil kecil air yang menyemprot dari menara akan kontak dengan udara lebih banyak saring dengan plastik yang berlubang lubang pula saring dan endapkan dengan kerikil pasir dan ijuk
1116017 yang baik adalah air dari tuk sumber air sementara yang dari umbul wadon umbul lanang airnya terbatas maka ada pemikiran untuk mengambil air yang berada di ujung selokan mataram samigaluh dan kalibawang kulonprogo tapi diolah terlebih dahulu itu diperkirakan bisa mencukupi sleman bantul kulonprogo dan kodya tapi biayanya memang mahal
1116018 sepengetahuan saya air pdam di seluruh indonesia ini tak layak minum karena airnya diambil dari sumur dalam
1116019 pipa pdam itu panjang totalnya mencapai 700 km perbaikan kita lakukan bertahap bukan berarti pipa yang dibangun zaman belanda itu sama sekali tak pernah diganti
1116020 tahun lalu hanya 12 desa yang kesulitan air bersih tapi tahun ini bertambah lagi menjadi 15 desa
1116021 itu sangat berat bagi kami apalagi sekarang penghasilan juga ikut ikutan mengering kalau bisa ya dikasih bantuan air bersih
1116022 sekarang kami tinggal menunggu hasil pendataan dari kecamatan khususnya mengenai berapa kebutuhan air dan daerah daerah mana saja yang akan menjadi sasaran sudah ada tiga unit truk tangki pdam yang kami siapkan untuk itu

1116029 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
1116030 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
1116031 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
1116032 in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
1116033 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now

1116054 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position
1116055 speak no ill of your friends or associates in public
1116056 the movie concerns joanna joey drayton a young white american woman houghton who has had a whirlwind romance with dr prentice poitier an african american she met while on a holiday in hawaii of all places prentice plans to fly to new york later that night then on to an assignment in switzerland joanna plans to join him there soon to be married even though she has only known him for a very short period of time the plot is centered on joannas return to her liberal upper class american home in san francisco bringing her new fianc to dinner to meet her parents tracy and hepburn and the reaction of family and friends
1116057 the controversial subject of interracial marriage had been illegal historically in most of the united states and was still illegal in 17 southern u s states up until june 12 of that year although legalized throughout the u s following the supreme court decision in loving v virginia the topic was still taboo in many areas
1116058 the young doctor has graduated from a top school begun innovative medical initiatives in africa refused to have premarital sex with his fianc e despite her request and leaves money on his future desk in payment for a long distance phone call he has made consequently the only possible objection to his marrying joanna would be the fact she only met him nine days earlier

1116065 i can tell you flatly that u s forces are not operating across the iraqi border into iran in the south or anywhere else
1116066 the cia does not as a rule comment on allegations regarding covert operations
1116067 we need to get the background material on stayman to ken mehlman he said he would kill him
1116068 high level government officials to discovery and even a trial based merely on conclusory allegations that such officials knew of or condoned alleged wrongdoing by subordinate officials
1116069 this may be the most important bill we pass this year
1116070 this bill will effectively and unjustifiably grant immunity to companies that allegedly participated in an illegal wiretapping program
1116071 within the constitutions separation of powers structure few exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the executive to imprison a person
1116072 one cannot help but think this decision is not really about the detainees at all but about control of federal policy regarding enemy combatants
1116073 it will almost certainly cause more americans to be killed
1116074 some have suggested that detainee abuses committed by u s personnel at abu ghraib in iraq and at guantanamo were the result of a few bad apples acting on their own it would be a lot easier to accept if that were true
1116075 senior officials in the united states government sought out information on aggressive techniques twisted the law to create the appearance of their legality and authorized their use against detainees
1116076 particularly disturbing part of the story how the techniques used to teach american soldiers to resist abusive interrogations by enemies that refuse to follow the geneva conventions were turned on their head and sanctioned by senior leaders for their use offensively against detainees
1116077 that display last night on the floor is something ive never seen
1116078 i dont know how many people are up here for reelection but i am watching a few of them pretty closely
1116079 i say to all those people who are up for reelection if you think you can go home and say i voted no because this weak president the weakest political standing since they have done polling i voted because i was afraid to override his veto come on
1116080 administrator johnson has repeatedly insisted he reached his decisions on californias petition and the new ozone standard on his own relying on his best judgment
1116081 todays assertion of executive privilege raises serious questions about administrator johnsons credibility and the involvement of the president
1116082 to preserve the confidentiality that is essential to the ability of current and future presidents to receive candid analyses advice and recommendations
1116083 part and parcel of a larger effort to reinstate what the bush administration believes to be the proper scope of executive power
1116084 i can virtually guarantee you without a legislative basis federal courts are not going to be willing to uphold the indefinite detention of unlawful combatants
1116085 through misjudgment and overreaching the white house ended up with the very result it sought to avoid heavy judicial involvement and erosion of deference to the presidents view of wartime necessities
1116086 it planned for the best instead of preparing for the worst and decided that it would prefer to fight for what it wanted
1116087 it may well be fair to fault the bush administration politically for failing to work with congress early on to develop a statutory framework governing guantanamo detainees
1116088 but the narrow supreme court majorities in the guantanamo cases deserve far harsher criticism for their gross misreadings of the law and their abandonment of sound precedent on which the administration reasonably relied
1116089 i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to say there was a chance that the administration could lose this case
1116090 it would be very unusual for a congress and executive branch to formulate national security policy based on the expectation that the supreme court would misinterpret the constitution
1116091 i dont think anyone knows the answer to this question
1116092 on the one hand republicans say they made america safe that argument goes by the wayside if theres an attack on the other hand an attack would change the entire framework of this election
1116093 a candid and very disappointing glimpse into the thinking of one of mccains closest advisers
1116094 i think the remarks were so out of place that they call for some recalibration in the thinking and perhaps a greater adherence to principle here in staying away from the politics of fear
1116095 if he said that and i dont know the context i strenuously disagree
1116096 we know damn well its obama who would seek to appease our enemies we know damn well its mccain who wont put up with another attack
1116097 it focuses americas attention on the war on terrorism im not sure if it was intentional or not but i think it does have an effect
1116098 we certainly were concerned that an administration that had shown itself willing to do almost anything would do almost anything
1116099 we werent planning around it there were no meetings around an october surprise but were there discussions certainly
1116100 wouldnt be surprised if bin laden appeared in the next month
1116101 they have not and never have been given the rights of citizens of this country
1116102 we are going to be bollixed up in a way thats terribly unfortunate
1116103 our first obligation is the safety and security of this nation and the men and women who defend it this decision will harm our ability to do that
1116104 his continued support for the underlying legal principle that guantanamo stands for namely that detainees should not have access to a normal judicial process
1116105 i have extended an invitation to mr mcclellan to testify before the judiciary committee after discussions between committee staff and his attorneys
1116106 in his book mr mcclellan suggests that senior white house officials may have obstructed justice and engaged in a coverup regarding the valerie plame leak this alleged activity could well extend beyond the scope of the offenses for which scooter libby has been convicted and deserves further attention
1116107 we confirm that mr mcclellan will appear before the house committee on the judiciary and will answer questions as outlined in the chairmans invitation he will also make a statement about the policy proposals he presents in his book
1116108 there are preincident indicators things that happen before violence occurs
1116109 and what i really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign all the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling why it was this why it was that the feeling itself is the warning sign
1116110 when they saw that we were unified in sending that bill rather than falling for their scare tactics i think it sent them a message
1116111 so our leverage was increased because of our democratic unity in both cases
1116112 it is the result of compromise and like any compromise it is not perfect but i believe it strikes a sound balance
1116113 theres all kinds of noise in their system and our system
1116114 this cooperation is fun i must say and as the president said it is going to be a sprint to the last day of his office
1116115 has moved towards the europeans in a number of areas
1116116 this is a reminder that working families continue to bear the brunt of the failed bush economic policies that john mccain wants to continue for another four years
1116117 the wrong change for our country would be an economic agenda based upon the policies of the past that advocate higher taxes bigger government government run health care and greater isolationism to help families at this critical time we cannot afford to go backward as senator obama advocates
1116118 theyre the worst in 22 years im told americans are hurting american families are hurting american homeowners are hurting this is a very very serious situation
1116119 sadly it seems that is all president bush understood in the economy
1116120 senator mccain is going to be faced with some difficult votes
1116121 he has supported the bush economic policies and that will put him on the wrong side of some important economic issues in the coming weeks
1116122 the federal government has never in history extended unemployment benefits with the unemployment rate this low
1116123 its going to be the economy stupid all over again
1116124 i think we have to do all of those things i think we have to search for ways to give short term relief i think we need to examine every option to try to help the american economy at this time both short term and long term
1116125 theres a strong sense in europe and the world at large that america is letting the market have a free ride
1116126 the europeans believe that being a good global citizen in an era of sustainability means you dont just charge ahead and destroy the planet without concern for what youre doing
1116127 this is going to compel companies to be more responsible for their products than they have ever been
1116128 theyll have to know more about the chemicals they make what their products are and where they go
1116129 there are preincident indicators things that happen before violence occurs
1116130 and what i really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign all the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling why it was this why it was that the feeling itself is the warning sign
1116131 imagine if a president had stood before the first graduating class of this academy five decades ago and told the cadet wing that by the end of the 20th century the soviet union would be no more communism would stand discredited and the vast majority of the worlds nations would be democracies
1116132 when your approval ratings are down around 20 to 28 percent and the candidate of your own party is trying to hide from being seen with you history is your only hope
1116133 by just saying in the long run this is going to look great it makes it very hard to respond to

1116136 whenever i hear scott mcclellan talking about media credibility i strain to remember who it was who admitted jeff gannon to the white house press room and called on him all those times
1116137 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
1116138 shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that american flag lapel pin became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest
1116139 there s been a lot of people in new york state who have spoken with your wife who seems to be pretty much convinced she wants to run for the senate seat next year a how do you feel about that do you think she would be a good senator and as part of a broader question involving what has happened over the past year how are the two of you doing in trying to strengthen your relationship given everything you and she have been through over this past year
1116140 the most powerful leader in the world had called upon me to speak on his behalf and help restore credibility he lost amid the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq
1116141 were involved in my doing so rove libby the vice president the presidents chief of staff and the president himself
1116142 i was going to have a few comments on the other democratic presidential candidate john edwards but it turns out that you have to go into rehab if you use the word
1116143 there is no place in political discourse for this kind of hate filled and bigoted comments
1116144 however they put it the democrat approach in iraq comes down to this the terrorists win and america loses
1116145 we must begin by really standing with the iraqi people and their right to resist i can remain myself against all forms of violence and yet i cannot judge what someone has to do when pushed to the wall to protect all they love what does the iraqi resistance have to lose they are fighting for their country to protect their families and to preserve all they love they are fighting for their lives and we are fighting for lies it is so amazingly obvious we must get out of iraq now they will rebuild their country it will take time a long time but they cannot start until we are gone
1116146 it just got lost in the redesign of the web site as did dozens and dozens of other pages
1116147 where are these men and women with any integrity to speak out against this i expect better behavior from republicans

1116223 in 2005 media matters came after me because i was critical of their co founder sen hillary clinton while asking president bush a question during a nationally televised press conference as retribution for speaking ill of sen clinton media matters launched a smear campaign to run me out of the white house press corps deliberately misrepresenting my two years of reporting at the white house during which time i wrote over 500 news articles for a daily readership of over half a million and falsely labeling me a fake reporter media matters also demanded that the white house pull my press credentials a direct attack on the first amendment guarantee of a free press

1116237 i suggest you have candidates in to meetings like this and bar the press
1116238 todays suggestion by democratic national committee chairman howard dean that the press be barred from covering candidates forums is so outrageous it defies reason
1116239 one wonders whether like a small child seeking attention the statement was designed simply to get a rise out of reporters
1116240 if there is a concern that candidates talk only in sound bites and not in meaningful dialog they have only themselves to blame
1116241 further if the chairman would prefer that his partys candidates no longer be covered by the media we would posit that not only would that candidate have a much more difficult time reaching the majority of the electorate but also that those messages would be far more scripted and managed and thus less credible to the public

1116278 jubilant democrats should reconsider their order for confetti and newsmakers our analysis based on a race by race examination of campaign finance data suggests that the gop will hang on to both chambers at least nominally we expect the republican majority in the house to fall by eight seats to 224 of the chambers 435 at the very worst our analysis suggests the partys loss could be as large as 14 seats leaving a one seat majority but that is still a far cry from the 20 seat loss some are predicting in the senate with 100 seats we see the gop winding up with 52 down three we studied every single race all 435 house seats and 33 in the senate and based our predictions about the outcome in almost every race on which candidate had the largest campaign war chest a sign of superior grass roots support we ignore the polls thus our conclusions about individual races often differ from the conventional wisdom pollsters for instance have upstate new york republican rep tom reynolds trailing democratic challenger jack davis who owns a manufacturing plant but reynolds raised 3 3 million in campaign contributions versus 1 6 million for davis so we score him the winner likewise we disagree with pollsters of both parties who see indiana republican rep chris chocola getting whomped by democratic challenger joe donnelly a lawyer and business owner from south bend chocola has raised 2 7 million versus 1 1 million for donnelly ditto in north carolina where we see republican rep charles taylor beating democrat heath shuler a former nfl quarterback because of better financing analysts from both parties predict a shuler upset is our method reliable it certainly has been in the past using it in the 2002 and 2004 congressional races we bucked conventional wisdom and correctly predicted gop gains both years look at house races back to 1972 and youll find the candidate with the most money has won about 93 of the time and thats closer to 98 in more recent years according to the center for responsive politics polls can be far less reliable remember they all but declared john kerry president on election day 2004

1116322 if they have nothing to hide why are they hiding everything why are they hiding audiotapes of faa and norad controllers why are they hiding videotapes of whatever hit the pentagon why are they hiding the black boxes why did they destroy most of the forensic evidence showing that three buildings at the world trade center were brought down by thermite demolition charges if the thermite residue found on severed steel beams didn t bring down the towers what did never before in history did steel skyscrapers fall because of fire and three of them did on the same day one of which wasn t even hit by an airplane why did four hijacked airliners fly around for up to an hour and 45 minutes without being intercepted why were normal procedures not followed if normal procedures had been followed the aircraft would have been intercepted with 20 minutes to spare the twin towers would still be standing and thousands of dead americans would still be alive if it was massive incompetence why has no one been fired or demoted or court martialed instead they were promoted or given the medal of freedom if osama bin laden was really suspected why did our government violate its own no fly order to hurriedly fly the bin laden family out of the united states before they could be questioned why does the osama bin laden in the confession videotape have a nose about an inch shorter than the real osama bin laden why have half a dozen of the 19 hijackers turned up in other countries alive and well were there really any hijackers at all and if there were were they patsies who made millions on short sales of united and american airlines where is the tens of billions of dollars worth of missing gold that was stored in the world trade center
1116323 the hypothesis is not absurd that those towers could have been dynamited a building never collapses like that unless its with an implosion
1116324 too much attention was paid to wilson and is false claims
1116325 president bush is invoking the memory of sept 11 to defend the war in iraq drawing protests from democrats who say he politicized a national day of mourning
1116326 we havent been defeated militarily but we have been defeated politically and thats where wars are won and lost
1116327 there are a lot of people who think that subpoenas could be coming
1116328 i made a terrible mistake not maliciously but i made a terrible mistake
1116329 i did what i did i embarrassed my president my secretary my department my family and i embarrassed the wilsons and for that im very sorry
1116330 abc has a responsibility to make clear that this film is not a documentary and does not represent an official account of the facts surrounding the september 11th attacks
1116331 we have yet to establish the impartiality and accuracy of the people behind this film and the claims it advances and the american people need to know that
1116332 but what is far more important is the timing of this movie
1116333 the anniversary of the attacks is an emotional time and it is wrong for anyone to play on those emotions and use them to advance a political agenda
1116334 we have been told we are in a fight against a new kind of fascism and that individuals who question our current path in iraq are morally equivalent to nazi appeasers and those who would justify slavery
1116335 such claims are more than just morally reprehensible and deeply irresponsible they are also damaging to our country making it difficult if not impossible to have a serious non partisan discussion about how best to protect our nation
1116336 democrats have always worked to promote a more peaceful and secure world and we will continue to do so regardless of this divisive republican rhetoric
1116337 what america needs is real security based on an honest view of the world and the threats against us not more divisive pre election rhetoric that slanders political opponents while doing nothing to make our nation more secure
1116338 we have met at previous briefings that you have done on other subjects africa related
1116339 because of our oft stated belief that far too much attention and debate in washington has been devoted to her story and that of her husband former ambassador joseph c wilson iv
1116340 nevertheless it now appears that the person most responsible for the end of ms plames cia career is mr wilson mr wilson chose to go public with an explosive charge claiming falsely as it turned out that he had debunked reports of iraqi uranium shopping in niger and that his report had circulated to senior administration officials he ought to have expected that both those officials and journalists such as mr novak would ask why a retired ambassador would have been sent on such a mission and that the answer would point to his wife he diverted responsibility from himself and his false charges by claiming that president bushs closest aides had engaged in an illegal conspiracy its unfortunate that so many people took him seriously
1116341 before the novak column was published two top white house officials contacted at least six reporters and disclosed the identity and occupation of wilsons wife
1116342 cindy lost her womb but opened camp casey with loving arms as a metaphoric womb to those brave souls willing to say no more willing to say that they love their country enough to stand up for what is right and against what is wrong
1116343 it is important to distinguish between the militia or death squads and the resistance particularly when considering the amnesty aspects of the reconciliation plan crafted in cairo last month
1116344 if we withdraw before the job is done the enemy will follow us here
1116345 our constitution was drafted by founders and ratified by a people who still held in vivid memory the image of king george iii and his general warrants
1116346 earlier chief judge anna diggs taylor of the federal district court in detroit tried to take the suit against the law school away from judge bernard freedman who had been assigned it through a blind draw and who was suspected of being skeptical about affirmative action and consolidate it with a similar suit against the universitys undergraduate admissions practice which judge patrick duggan was hearing
1116347 a sense of frustration on the lack of progress on the bigger picture of iraq generally
1116348 the president expressed frustration that iraqis have not come to appreciate the sacrifices the united states has made in iraq and was puzzled as to how a recent anti american rally in support of hezbollah in baghdad could draw such a large crowd
1116349 five years after 9 11 al qaeda has morphed into a global franchise operation terror attacks have increased sharply across the world and the president has shut down the program designed to catch osama bin laden
1116350 i am of course very concerned regarding any allegations surrounding misconduct by u s troops in iraq such allegations must be taken seriously but we should never rush to judgment before all the facts are known and the military criminal justice process is completed
1116351 i believe he fired photographer adnan hajj was trying to take a picture and make it better rather than trying to take a picture and make a statement
1116352 do you really think these people would risk their lives under israeli shelling to set up a digging ceremony for dead lebanese kids
1116353 its hard to imagine how someone sitting in an air conditioned office or broadcast studio many thousands of miles from the scene can decide what occurred on the ground with any degree of accuracy
1116354 its not helpful to couch this war in the language of international terrorism
1116355 he was wiped out by hurricane katrina and wanted to start over
1116356 the american ambassador to the u n is supposed to serve america not the u n
1116357 many ambassadors at the u n feel that he bolton hasnt done a good job there
1116358 right now i am focused on my job as president of iraq and savior of palestine i dont have any plans beyond that
1116359 i m rubber you re glue whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you
1116360 frank rich finds himself in over his head when not writing about gay cowboy movies
1116361 i have been long concerned that a strong and well positioned group within the agency intentionally undermined the administration and its policies
1116362 this argument is supported by the ambassador wilson valerie plame events as well as by the string of unauthorized disclosures from an organization which prides itself with being able to keep secrets
1116363 further the details surrounding mr kappes departure from the cia give me great pause
1116364 the fact is mr kappes and his deputy mr sulick were developing a communications offensive to bypass the intelligence committees and the cias own office of congressional affairs one can only speculate on the motives but it clearly indicates a willingness to promote a personal agenda every day we suffer from individuals promoting their personal agendas this is clearly a place where we do not want or need to be
1116365 this is a private matter between jerome and the sec relating to activities years ago
1116366 seek criminal charges against newspapers that reported on a secret financial monitoring program used to trace terrorists
1116367 the city of about 31 000 has passed a tough illegal immigration measure that will revoke the business license of companies that employ illegal immigrants impose fines on landlords who rent to them and make english the city s official language
1116368 his position with the network had been strained after a september 2004 report he did for
1116369 the first amendment does not protect a news reporter or that reporters news organization from producing documents in a criminal case
1116370 has taken the view they are going to be the opposition to the government
1116371 lawyers for nbc news the new york times and time inc accused a former white house aide tuesday of threatening the integrity of their news gathering operations
1116372 lawyers for the new york times depicted libby as desperate in casting a
1116373 nbcs lawyers said russert does not have any documents that would show that plames cia employment was known before novaks column they said mitchells records arent relevant to the criminal case and are protected from release under the first amendment
1116374 that there were buyers like iraq who would pay more for nigers uranium than france
1116375 frequent leadpipe guarantees by the french ambassador here that no uranium diversion to rogue states is possible
1116376 the pollsters may be satisfied but john f kennedy would not recognize his party
1116377 if he uses the mixed messages line one more time im going to puke
1116378 what if they held a war protest and nobody came
1116379 what did you know about valerie plame and when did you know it
1116380 look for a washington post article from walter pincus about how many long time employees are deciding to leave the state department this will be a good thing they can all join ann wright and cindy sheehan in the ditch in crawford texas
1116381 dont try any of the snarky crap with me cause ill cut ya
1116382 initially the panel of three judges that oversees the lingering issues involving the independent counsel law agreed in october to the public release of mr barretts report but said the section with accusations about clinton officials must be deleted but after congressional republicans attached a rider to a department of housing and urban development spending bill requiring publication of the full report the judicial panel in november ordered a full disclosure
1116383 you ve been behaving like an overgrown schoolboy in this room for many many months and years you are an embarrassment to your colleagues and to your profession please stop misbehaving and please let s move on to a serious journalist
1116384 oh that kofi weve never seen him so angry he must have been provoked
1116385 they democrats got what they wanted recently when the house and senate met to iron out differences in yet another appropriations bill democrats inserted language that would prevent public release of the 120 pages of the report listing the clinton transgressions
1116386 those mean republicans are demanding that we tell the american people what we really think of the war and our troops
1116387 democrats need to devise a unified political strategy on iraq before republicans box them in
1116388 i dunno i think they just make this sh t up
1116389 i admired gene enormously for his courage in challenging a war america never should have fought his life speaks volumes to us today as we face a similar critical time for our country
1116390 bush has told friends that rumsfeld is a political liability
1116391 mr cheney explained he was there to have a dialogue with the troops he promised that within about a minute he would kick the press out so nobodys intimidated by the presence of the cameras after making good on his promise the vice president cracked it always makes my day the soldiers laughed heartily as the reporters slunk away
1116392 idea that were going to win the war in iraq is an idea which is just plain wrong
1116393 dont they know were the media were on their side
1116394 given the publics reaction and the white houses cave it might make sense for other democrats to follow murtha on style if not on substance and come forward with a specific clear and bold plan for bringing american troops home
1116395 congressman murtha is a respected veteran and politician who has a record of supporting a strong america so it is baffling that he is endorsing the policy positions of michael moore and the extreme liberal wing of the democratic party the eve of an historic democratic election in iraq is not the time to surrender to the terrorists after seeing his statement we remain baffled nowhere does he explain how retreating from iraq makes america safer
1116396 a half dozen top officers most recently the dos directorate of operations no 2 official 35 year veteran robert richer
1116397 clip the wings of the head gossling his chief of staff patrick murray goss should heed that advice before even more officers quit in disgust at the political meddling
1116398 possible violations under consideration by mr fitzgerald are peripheral to the issue he was appointed in december 2003 to investigate
1116399 air america the liberal talk network carried on wwrc am 1260 went from bad to nonexistent after wwrc recorded a mere fraction of a rating point in the spring with syndicated shows from the likes of lefty talkers al franken janeane garofalo and stephanie miller arbitron couldnt detect a measurable listenership for the station this time around
1116400 special prosecutor patrick fitzgeralds cia leak inquiry is focusing attention on what long has been a tactic of u s president george w bushs administration slash and burn assaults on its critics particularly those opposed to the presidents iraq war policies
1116401 theres been an attempt to put reporters on the spot and question the motivation of reporters
1116402 has adopted this siege mentality in which the best way to deflect the question is to attack the questioner im not quite sure who hes playing to maybe the segment of the republican party that believes were a bunch of liberals who have our own agenda
1116403 bush ruled out handing over internal documents sought by democrats that might shed light on her legal views
1116404 delay is a fierce partisan infighter and the democrats realize that and are trying to respond in kind
1116405 fatma nevin vargun a kurdish womens rights activist denounced the arrest of cindy sheehan the mother of an american soldier killed in iraq in front of the white house this week
1116406 listen there are differences of opinion about the way forward i understand that some americans want us to withdraw our troops so that we can escape the violence i recognize their good intentions but their position is wrong withdrawing our troops would make the world more dangerous and make america less safe
1116407 to leave iraq now would be to repeat the costly mistakes of the past that led to the attacks of september the 11th 2001 the terrorists saw our response to the hostage crisis in iran the bombings in the marine barracks in lebanon the first world trade center attack the killing of american soldiers in somalia the destruction of two u s embassies in africa and the attack on the uss cole the terrorists concluded that we lacked the courage and character to defend ourselves and so they attacked us
1116408 the political nature of this prosecution should be obvious to everyone and i dont think chicagoans want their city run like the post office or fema
1116409 my son was murdered by bush and his insane arrogant callous foreign policy
1116410 i want to ask the president why did he kill my son
1116411 i want him to justify his killing his murdering and his imperialistic foreign policies on my sons blood on my sons honor
1116412 im not going to call him mr president because he does not deserve our respect
1116413 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
1116414 you stated in january of 2005 that the u s economy was on the verge of collapse but that social security was rock solid for the next 50 years how do you reconcile those two views which seem divorced from reality
1116415 president bush on monday signed sweeping legislation that provides billions of dollars in tax subsidies to energy companies yet does little quickly to ease gas prices or lower americas reliance on foreign oil
1116416 a source familiar with the case said the investigation had no connection to the inquiry into jeffersons brother in law alan green a former state judge
1116417 bush is setting a bad example for the nations youth and is using up limited health care resources by living a careless lifestyle while millions go without health insurance women and children hardest hit
1116418 in your face gesture to congress and to the global community
1116419 nothing at all is proven but its worth recalling the dangers
1116420 it was a bit of an alice in wonderland moment last night watching president bush in the state dining room lauding the accomplishments and character of one john roberts
1116421 i dont want to say that the swirl of speculation surrounding names like edith clement edith jones and others was an elaborate head fake to keep us off the scent of the real nominee but a lot of people who were in the initial loop of selecting a replacement for sandra day oconnor were pushing those names pretty hard of course we bear some responsibility for that as well we are so determined to crack the nut of this uber disciplined white house that any dribble of information is lapped up like mothers milk and i must admit we created a media echo chamber tuesday eventually we began to hear back rumors that were prompted by our own inquiries im certain that there was no end of glee at the white house as officials watched us chase our tails all day and ill bet they chuckled to themselves as they let their telephones ring and ring as their caller ids flashed up the numbers of white house reporters
1116422 i was very young how will i explain this to my children
1116423 we understand you are now close to a decision on a supreme court nominee
1116424 thank you for telling me how close i am to or at least indicating what others think
1116425 ms miller learned about valerie plame from a confidential source or sources whose identity she continues to protect to this day if the suggestion is that she is covering up for herself or some fictitious source that is preposterous given that she is suffering in jail it is also mean spirited
1116426 ok so he wasnt the leaker but he should have known better than to talk about a cia employee without knowing whether she is an agent under deep cover or not
1116427 robust growth in revenues the 2005 deficit will be significantly less than 350 billion perhaps below 325 billion
1116428 politicians we think by their nature want us to see things as all black or all white progress is being made the president is divorced from reality take your pick one or the other
1116429 43 cases in which individuals named by the writer could not be authenticated as real people
1116430 now many conservatives fear the religious right could hurt the partys cause by using faith based arguments about abortion same sex marriage and the separation of church and state to promote a supreme court nominee
1116431 conservatives saw the savagery of 9 11 and the attacks and prepared for war liberals saw the savagery of the 9 11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers
1116432 karl rove deserves a medal hillary clinton shes the one who went to the floor of the senate and implied president bush knew about sept 11 and let it happen
1116433 i think its a little hypocritical of senator clinton to call on me to repudiate a political figures comments when she never asked senator durbin to repudiate his comments
1116434 senator clinton might think about her propensity to allow outrageous statements from the other side that are far beyond political dialogue insulting every republican comparing our soldiers to nazis or soviet gulag guards and never protesting when she serves with them
1116435 a nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious
1116436 my view is fox news is a propaganda outlet for the republican party and i dont comment on fox news
1116437 the architect of the defeat of the federal marriage amendment
1116438 it is very hard to stop people who have never been acquainted with the truth
1116439 i know its frustrating for many of you its frustrating for me why cant the democrats do more to stop them
1116440 the state has an interest in protecting the sanctity of the lives of its citizens
1116441 yes you had a lot of made up words for things i had to leave lists of words and translations for baby sitters so they would know what you were talking about
1116442 oh i dont know its just that its such short notice
1116443 i just dont know i just dont know three days at this age it might just be too much
1116444 i contend that christians will only have authority if they first serve the needs of others in sacrificial ways especially the poor and oppressed when those who hold power witness how christians live out love meeting the needs of others and binding up the wounds who have been left hurting by societys waysides christians will earn the authority to speak when christians sacrificially give of their time and resources to run soup kitches for the hungry and provide shelters for the homeless they gain the right to be heard when they tutor poor children and care for those with aids they expand their mandate to call for change but before they speak christians must demonstrate gods love through sacrificial ministries sacrifice gives them the ability to be taken seriously by those who seem to be in control of political machines
1116445 mommy see those guys is that truck thats what i wanna be
1116446 two women may be staying at the same hospital but one of them is receiving high city officials with loads of gifts and the other one receives no compensation from the government and its all because one of them gave birth on the 12th and the other one on the 11th

1116470 is the ability to neutralize harmful molecules in our cells
1116471 the unpaired electrons make free radicals highly reactive and in this state they can cause damage by attacking the components of our cells and can even cause cancer
1116472 antioxidants stop the chain reaction of free radical formation and benefit our health by boosting our immune system
1116473 as with most things excessive levels of antioxidants can be toxic
1116474 we dont yet fully understand the mechanisms by which selenium and other antioxidants work and so we must be cautious about prescribing diets high in these elements
1116475 is to eat a variety of fruits vegetables and nuts to ensure that we are taking advantage of all the health benefits that antioxidants can provide

1116483 i left gao for spain crossing the desert took several weeks and was a terrible experience but its worse when you get to algeria the algerian police took our passports all our documents and then beat us and took us to the police station they do that to everyone who arrives
1116484 from algeria i had to get to morocco and that journey was full of problems too it takes twelve days from the mali algerian border to the morocco border twelve days of desert without much to eat or drink
1116485 finally i got to spain by crossing the sea but i only got to spend three weeks there because they sent me home some 280 migrants were expelled with me but im going back im trying again i just need to find enough money

1116494 in a vote likely to haunt him for the rest of his public career mccain voted against 1983 legislation establishing the third monday in january as the federal holiday marking kings birthday back home in arizona he supported gov evan mechams decision in 1987 to rescind an executive order creating a state holiday for king but later reversed his position

1116529 the prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth
1116530 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude people ask why is there poverty in the world its a silly question poverty is the default human condition the interesting question isnt why is there poverty its why is there wealth or why is there prosperity here but not there at the end of the day the first answer is capitalism rightly understood that is to say free markets private property the spirit of entrepreneurialism and the conviction that the fruits of your labors are your own in large measure our wealth isnt the product of capitalism it is capitalism and yet we hate it leaving religion out of it no idea has given more to humanity the average working class person today is richer in real terms than the average prince or potentate of 300 years ago his food is better his life longer his health better his menu of entertainments vastly more diverse his toilette infinitely more civilized and yet we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual meanwhile billions have ridden capitalism out of poverty and yet the children of capitalism still whine
1116531 when world war ii ended the united states had the only undamaged industrial power in the world our military might was at its peak and we alone had the ultimate weapon the nuclear weapon with the unquestioned ability to deliver it anywhere in the world if we had sought world domination then who could have opposed us but the united states followed a different course one unique in all the history of mankind we used our power and wealth to rebuild the war ravished economies of the world including those of the nations who had been our enemies may i say there is absolutely no substance to charges that the united states is guilty of imperialism or attempts to impose its will on other countries by use of force
1116532 lots of iranian people know that the mullahs are losing iraq and more of them would know if we had a more accurate and honest press and an administration capable of explaining the world and its reaction to it our miserable policy which is to chant we dont want regime change we want a change in behavior is doomed as the whole world has known from the get go paradoxically this non aggressive policy is destined to make military conflict inevitable whoever is the next president this policy is a preemptive acquiescence to a nuclear iran with all the incalculable consequences attendant to it and is guaranteed to bring us face to face with the sarkozy option of bomb iran or iran with the bomb and yet the iranian regime is hollow so far as we know they are without atomic bombs and a reliable delivery system we have defeated them in iraq and will repeat it in afghanistan their economy is a shambles their people hate them they present us with potemkin weapons systems it is a political explosion ready to happen it only needs the support of the west
1116533 if youre bothered by skyrocketing food and energy prices wait until congress re introduces its environmentalist inspired climate security act so called cap and trade cap and trade is deceptively peddled as a free market solution to the yet to be settled issue of manmade climate change under its provisions companies would be able to emit greenhouse gases only if they had a government allowance the congressional budget office estimates that a 15 percent cut in emissions would raise the annual average households energy costs by 1 300 since energy is an input to everything we use we can expect everything to become more costly resulting in a reduction in economic growth theres a hateful side to cap and trade thats revealed by asking the question how will it be decided who received how much allowance to emit greenhouse gases congress could sell the allowances and or give them away to favorite constituents you can bet the rent money that a new army of lobbyists with special pleadings will descend on washington to lobby congress and you can be sure that campaign contributions and favoritism will play an important role in the decision of who received what amount of allowances much worse than that is the massive control government would have over our economy and our lives the thirst to wield massive control over our economy helps explain the near religious belief in manmade global warming and the attacks on scientists and others who offer contradictory evidence

1116536 sought to emphasize as he and his aides have done continually over the last few days the difference between avoiding preconditions for talks with nations like iran and syria and granting them automatic discussions at the presidential level
1116537 while mr obama has said he would depart from the bush administration policy of refusing to meet with certain nations unless they meet preconditions he has also said he would reserve the right to choose which leaders he would meet should he choose to meet with them at all
1116538 the issue presents one of mr obamas biggest political and policy tests yet as he appears headed toward a general election contest against senator john mccain of arizona how to continue to add nuance to a policy argument that he views as a winning one without playing into a fierce round of accusations that he is either shifting positions or appeasing the enemy
1116539 i guess the question is if you had a chance to make progress on some of these issues that go to the security of our country and the world why would you say you would never be willing to it is an odd thing to say what sen obama is saying in essence is that we need to use all the tools in our toolbox when we are working and fighting for our security including for aggressive diplomacy which has been shunned by the bush administration to our detriment
1116540 sen joseph biden yesterday said his one time presidential rival sen barack obama has asked him to play a more prominent and deeply involved role in his campaign a signal the likely democratic nominee is looking to burnish his foreign policy credentials that republicans are attacking

1116542 you can say those things when youre not running for reelection
1116543 i truly cannot believe that any vice president of the united states would make such a derogatory statement about my state or any state for that matter
1116544 on reflection he concluded that it was an inappropriate attempt at humor that he should not have made the vice president apologizes to the people of west virginia for the inappropriate remark
1116545 some of this minimal paperwork business is coming directly from the secretary
1116546 i dont know what hes referring to i dont cut out people of my team so this has been very much an administration effort
1116547 trick the eye with pleasant things cloths cottages green landscapes shady trees bridges and brooks these they call landscapes with the odd little figure here and there without symmetry or proportion without substance or backbone
1116548 i dont think i should put myself in the position of being a media critic or political pundit
1116549 you all are well aware of how engaged this president is in the response efforts and making sure that were meeting the immediate needs

1116553 this weekends uproar over hillary rodham clinton invoking the assassination of robert kennedy as rationale for continuing her presidential campaign is an especially vivid example of modern journalism as hyperkinetic child overstimulated by speed and hunger for a head turning angle that will draw an audience
1116554 on friday afternoon i heard my colleague politico reporter jonathan martin bellow in excitement as he called me over to his desk
1116555 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
1116556 managed the crisis in a way that almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option
1116557 top bush aides had outlined a strategy for carefully orchestrating the coming campaign to aggressively sell the war in the permanent campaign era it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the presidents advantage
1116558 what i do know is that war should only be waged when necessary and the iraq war was not necessary
1116559 like many americans i am concerned about the poisonous atmosphere in washington i wanted to take readers inside the white house and provide them an open and honest look at how things went off course and what can be learned from it hopefully in some small way it will contribute to changing washington for the better and move us beyond the hyper partisan environment that has permeated washington over the past 15 years
1116560 there would need to be hearings real hearings to find out what actually happened what harms actually occurred rather than some sort of sweeping of things under the rug
1116561 senator mccain supported and voted for immunity for the past actions of the telecommunications companies but going forward he does not want them put into this position again
1116562 most important in all of this there must be clear guidelines for their participation and sufficient vetting
1116563 if thats his view today he had a chance to back it up in recent votes on the senate floor and he did not
1116564 everything that senator mccains aide has said is fully consistent with what weve said
1116565 to back down from his untenable position so we can negotiate a bill as quickly as possible
1116566 there would probably be three things that would matter in a mccain administration
1116567 the first thing is it would need to be explicit that were not talking about something like granting indulgences
1116568 congress would need to provide clear rules so that we would be certain that private records would be protected in the future
1116569 a unique opportunity to engage with one of the most resource rich countries in the world
1116570 there are a lot of people who are having trouble making the transition in their mind from how iraq looked in 2007 and how iraq looks now
1116571 the international community needs to stand by iraq as it moves ahead
1116572 iraq will always remember the countries that have stood by its side
1116573 success in preventing iraq from falling into civil war and putting an end to displacement
1116574 while the political situation and by consequence the security situation remains fragile
1116575 signals indicate that previous conflict dynamics are moving toward negotiated compromise
1116576 iraq is seeking to re engage with neighbors and the international community on the basis of mutual commitment and benefit

1116580 we shall be prepared if others wish it we shall be alert to try to stop it but we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just
1116581 in your time i think this is one important idea that has real legs and staying power
1116582 the work of democratic development is the great cause of our time and we shouldnt shy away from it
1116583 and we must be confident in our ability to help others realize the blessings of freedom my big concern is that the united states becomes isolationist and nervous we dont support those values that have stood the test of time
1116584 this is a significant revelation and if true a serious matter
1116585 the department will review chairman waxmans letter and respond as appropriate
1116586 the president and vice president directed me to go out there and exonerate scooter libby
1116587 it would be a major breach of trust if the vice president personally directed mr mcclellan to mislead the public
1116588 these records were turned over to the committee by the justice department without any consultation with the white house
1116589 it remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and threatens to destabilize the entire middle east from basra to beirut
1116590 its hard to see what such a summit with president ahmadinejad would actually gain except an earful of anti semitic rants and a worldwide audience for a man who denies one holocaust and talks before frenzied crowds about starting another
1116591 should the security council continue to delay in this responsibility the united states must lead like minded countries in imposing multilateral sanctions outside the u n framework
1116592 dangerous and failed foreign policy that has clearly made the united states and israel less secure
1116593 stubbornly refuses to engage in aggressive diplomacy ruling it out unconditionally as a tool of american power

1116601 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
1116602 thats why i did the mixtape that i did i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game

1116615 because of rising demand for body contouring procedures it is increasingly important for plastic surgeons to be cognizant of potential predictors of poor outcomes and or complications that can arise as a result
1116616 obesity is a significant risk factor when considering operative procedures particularly due to secondary conditions such as hypertension diabetes sleep apnea cardiovascular disease and poor healing that generally accompany it
1116617 these findings lay the groundwork for establishing evidence based medicine guidelines to better assist us in evaluating patients for potential risk when considering these increasingly popular procedures and in weighing those risks against the potential benefits in our varied patients
1116618 it is our responsibility as plastic surgeons to do everything possible to ensure the best and safest results for our patients

1116623 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
1116624 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
1116625 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
1116626 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
1116627 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
1116628 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
1116629 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
1116630 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
1116631 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
1116632 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
1116633 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
1116634 which blog ill indicate now where am i going to find all these data in one blog only will it be possible to keep on scrabbling my blog without fs i understand his reasons but it will be much more harder to unite people
1116635 so you agree on something right out of the chute you seem to disagree on everything else though
1116636 in several clinical studies during which subjective parameters were monitored cannabinoids not only improved physical symptoms but also improved well being and produced measurable antidepressant effects a study by musty 2002 with healthy volunteers smoking cannabis showed a positive correlation with the ratings on a scale of depression mmpi indicating an antidepressant effect these indications of a therapeutic potential of symptoms of depression encouraged the author to start administering dronabinol marinol to select patients suffering from depression
1116637 maybe we can one day get the good folks at eli lilly back into the cannabis tincture business and out of the ssri snri business
1116638 i have to do some serious thinking about whether its worth continuing this site and continuing to be a journalist in general its clearly a dying profession and im nearing my 46th birthday and getting a lot of encouragement from various friends to move on with my life and do something else because the free market has spoken in loud and clear terms that it does not value people like me very highly at all
1116639 at the end of september when the antidepressant i was on made me go wonky i asked my doctor to refer me to a psychiatrist
1116640 by the time my appointment came up i was feeling fine my drugs were working and i wondered if i even needed a psychiatrist after all but given my family history i decided to go anyway it couldnt hurt right wrong oh so very wrong
1116641 i was determined to have a positive attitude and to be open minded sitting in that waiting room i tried not to be nervous and instead psyched myself up hah telling myself this is something im doing to make my life better and ensure i am going to be healthy long into the future
1116642 i quickly figured out that this appointment wasnt what i was hoping it would be no matter how much positive energy i tried to throw at it
1116643 im not disputing the diagnosis itself its a fair hypothesis and one that i have considered myself however i have a huge problem with a doctor diagnosing a patient within five minutes and then accusing her of all kinds of behaviour that doesnt exist
1116644 as the interview or interrogation as it became went on the two of us got more and more frustrated and the conversation grew heated
1116645 dr r do you ever spend large amounts of money
1116646 savia sure i have a house im doing home renovations right now
1116647 savia but im making an investment in my home and my house value has quadrupled in the past seven years
1116648 dr r going into debt for any reason is hypomanic
1116649 savia what but its not just any debt its good debt
1116650 dr r there is no such thing as good debt
1116651 at the beginning of the appointment i was quite succinct in my answers
1116652 dr r youre talking fast and circumventing the question thats hypomanic
1116653 dr r cutting me off there you go rationalizing your behaviour again
1116654 what did eli lilly know about prozac induced violence amp suicidality
1116655 there have been a fairly large number of reports of adverse reactions another depressed patient developed psychosis akathisia and restlessness were reported in some patients
1116656 during the treatment with the preparation prozac 16 suicide attempts were made 2 of these with success as patients with a risk of suicide were excluded from the studies it is probable that this high proportion can be attributed to an action of the preparation prozac
1116657 immediate follow up on all key opinion leaders on the bga commission for selected visitation next week
1116658 the incidence rate suicide under fluoxetine prozac therefore purely mathematically is 5 6 times higher than under the other active medication imipramine
1116659 the benefits vs risks considerations for fluoxetine prozac currently does not fall clearly in favor of the benefits therefore it is of the greatest importance that it be determined whether there is a particular subgroup of patients who respond better to fluoxetine prozac than to imipramine so that the higher incidence of suicide attempts may be tolerable
1116660 mania and psychosis may be precipitated in susceptible patients by antidepressant therapy
1116661 i was depressed i was trying to make myself feel better

1116686 music is as close to people as their three square meals a day
1116687 based on all of the transactional information the company captures on its consumer base it should be able to apply a lot of that insight to design the sweepstakes in a way that gets the most registrations
1116688 which is the direction it and other music companies are looking to perpetuate
1116689 this decentralization of its offerings is what they need to do to get some of that share back
1116690 its great for mastercard to be the arbiter of music which allows them to develop a new platform from which to message with its beneficial to consumers who are out there in the digital space looking for music
1116691 i think now to be successful and break through the clutter companies like ourselves need to be creative in how we engage the consumer
1116692 to evaluate what were doing just through tv ratings would be short sighted
1116693 were trying to re energize the world series of poker with the playing community and make it compelling to the mainstream community by presenting it in a manner that theyre accustomed to with the build up and the hype like theyve seen with network deal or no deal
1116694 to evaluate what were doing just through tv ratings would be short sighted

1116696 i think now would be a good time to inventory our system and get an idea of where the problems are and what it would cost to start fixing them
1116697 we lost about 3 500 in sales and another 2 500 in what we paid to the plumber and hvac repairman making sure everything was back up and running right

1116750 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1116751 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1116752 im not a happy person when im not running well
1116753 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable

1116755 when the chase starts theres going to be a different race going on
1116756 theres not going to be the race of going out for wins and doing pit strategy things and stuff like that which will take your chance out of a good top 10 or a good top five you just have to be consistent and stay up there in order to get those finishes

1116761 vedi ogni persona ha un suo odore un essenza particolare se chiudessi un alcolizzato in una stanza piena di lattine di birra sgasata le berrebbe senza badarci se invece fosse un alcolista pentito se decidesse di non berle potrebbe riuscirci facilmente ora se poniamo nella stanza un solo bicchiere di liquore invecchiato cento anni il cognac migliore il pi raro di tutti che diffonde ovunque il suo profumo come credi che si comporterebbe il nostro alcolizzato restammo zitti guardandoci negli occhi cercando di leggerci nel pensiero a vicenda fu lui a riprendere il discorso forse non la metafora migliore forse rifiutare il cognac sarebbe facile forse dovrei trasformare il nostro alcolista in un eroinomane cio vorresti dirmi che sono la tua qualit preferita di eroina dissi nel tentativo di alleggerire latmosfera sorrise allistante sembrava apprezzare lo sforzo ecco tu sei esattamente la mia qualit preferita di eroina lt 3
1116762 sembrava esitante ma non in maniera normale non come un uomo che sta per baciare una donna incerto della reazione e della risposta di lei che volesse prolungare quellistante il momento perfetto dellattesa impaziente che spesso meglio del bacio stesso

1116793 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab
1116794 it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample
1116795 what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1116796 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1116797 tutti possono farti regali tutti tranne me come lo spieghi
1116798 mi rendo conto che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo
1116799 ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto da finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza

1116832 the primary predators of polypterus senegalus are known to be its own species or its carnivorous vertebrate relatives and biting takes place during territorial fighting and feeding
1116833 such fundamental knowledge holds great potential for the development of improved biologically inspired structural materials for example soldier first responder and military vehicle armor applications
1116834 many of the design principles we describe durable interfaces and energy dissipating mechanisms for instance may be translatable to human armor systems
1116835 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1116836 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out
1116837 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together
1116838 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice
1116839 i couldnt bear the thought of getting more things to dust in our home
1116840 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1116841 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1116842 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money
1116843 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware
1116844 so we thought wed have people who want to celebrate with a gift do that with these two institutions

1116847 we consider a kit to be backdoored if it sends the phished information to addresses other than those found in clear in the kits code we found 129 of the kits from distribution sites slightly more than one third to be backdoored among live kits 61 40 are backdoored of these 20 send the phished information to addresses also found in 8 kits obtained from distribution sites assuming that authors and users of kits are different individuals this shows that backdoors are effective that is in a significant number of cases they do not appear to be detected at the same time it seems that when identified backdoors are updated to send the stolen information to new recipients

1116849 the huge advantage this gives us that weve only just started to realize is the opportunity to take advantage of web services out in the internet cloud
1116850 these five examples are only the tip of the iceberg of where we can go with this
1116851 there are five to six thousand web services out there that we can take advantage of

1116855 data is powerful overlooked and sometimes mistaken for boring you dont have to understand the why you merely need to know the what
1116856 the end of theory the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete
1116857 this is a world where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace every other tool that might be brought to bear out with every theory of human behavior from linguistics to sociology forget taxonomy ontology and psychology who knows why people do what they do the point is they do it and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity with enough data the numbers speak for themselves

1116859 you thought we could be decent men at indecent times but you were wrong the world is cruel and the only morality in a cruel world is chance
1116860 suffering under alzheimers disease was tragic and we should do everything we can that is ethically proper to help others afflicted with it but i have no doubt that he would have urged our nation to look to adult stem cell research which has yielded many clinical successes and away from the destruction of developing human lives which has yielded none
1116861 those who would trade on ronald reagans legacy should first consider his own words
1116862 my administration is dedicated to the preservation of america as a free land and there is no cause more important for preserving that freedom than affirming the transcendent right to life of all human beings the right without which no other rights have any meaning
1116863 maybe thats unfair but they need a story line thats relatively simple to understand
1116864 researchers have apparently known for some time that embryonic stem cells will not be an effective treatment for alzheimers because as two researchers told a senate subcommittee in may it is a whole brain disease rather than a cellular disorder such as parkinsons
1116865 it nancy reagans statement in support of escr is the kind of advocacy that researchers have craved for years and none wants to slow its momentum
1116866 over the horizon are so called adult stem cells ascs extracted from people of any age and from umbilical cords and placentas not only dont they carry the moral baggage of embryonic stem cells escs but research with them is much further along
1116867 unfortunately embryonic stem cell researchers have so powerful a pr machine that many influential people dont even know theres an alternative
1116868 there are clear cost advantages to installing solar panels compared to having transmission lines particularly in areas that are not easily accessible
1116869 moreover solar cells are easier to manage and maintain than other sources such as wind or nuclear
1116870 polysilicon prices are as high as 200 per kilogram since silicon which forms the base substrate for most solar modules is currently experiencing heavy shortage
1116871 the dearth of raw materials is preventing many manufacturing plants from operating at 100 percent capacity driving up the prices of solar modules and hence deterring potential investors
1116872 simteks nvsram technology combines with our s8 0 13 micron design platform to provide outstanding features and functions for the embedded marketplace

1116874 we are happy to join the ipte network we believe we are together creating an added value for ipte and taf3 our technical abilities were limited by our lack of international presence by joining the ipte group we become part of a major international automation player with strong presence all over europe asia and usa this will bring us the international dimension we were aiming before
1116875 this acquisition fits perfectly in the global account strategy of ipte automation

1116880 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the u s helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
1116881 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 percent of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
1116882 emerging markets are a major factor in driving worldwide semiconductor sales
1116883 pc unit sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by 19 more than double the growth rate in developed markets this year in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide pc sales in mobile phones developing countries are expected to account for 66 of total worldwide unit sales of over 1 3 billion up from 61 last year the emergence of large middle class populations in china india eastern europe and latin america has more than offset the effects of slower growth in the u s economy we expect that demand for consumer electronic products in these new markets will continue to outpace growth in developed markets for the next several years
1116884 inventory for the industry is in balance with minor excess in a few product sectors
1116885 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
1116886 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1 gigabit of dram has declined by 43 during the past year while the price of 2 gigabits of nand flash has declined by 61 in the last 12 months lower prices enable increased memory content in consumer devices micron estimates that the memory content of the average pc will increase at least 50 this year while the memory content in the average cell phone will increase by more than 150
1116887 the average dram contract price is expected to decline by more than 10 percent from the current level by the end of the third quarter
1116888 the inventory level in the channel and among pc oems has increased compared to the second quarter global economic conditions are adding more uncertainty on the demand side of the equation
1116889 the higher than anticipated increase in unit shipments in the second quarter signals that excess inventory is being shifted from the dram suppliers to the buyers
1116890 vou encontrar o homem da minha vida no dia 23 de novembro de 2008 s 13h
1116891 eu gosto do claro quando claro que voc me ama

1116895 there arent that many actors who would say in my feature film debut i was able to be the lead first of all and also to act alongside a guy like larry
1116896 i remember the struggles to get films made so my assistant went scouring looking for projects that were smaller and independent people that really couldnt afford me but people we could help by me being in it or involved or whatever
1116897 it was that two hour conversation what he was telling me he was trying to do who he was as a person it was all him
1116898 it wouldnt really have mattered if id seen the script at that point
1116899 i connect in so many ways with students i get to see the campus from a difference side it puts the campus in a different light
1116900 i never say i dont want to go to work
1116901 so the next year each lab took a week every year it gets better and better
1116902 so it doesnt matter if i get my fingers in it
1116903 basically we just told the kids okay play like you did at the concert last week and they got almost everything on the first take
1116904 i knew the students were good but for them to just lay down a clean track on the first try was beyond my wildest dreams
1116905 virginia remains an excellent location for new or existing businesses
1116906 it has the best regulatory environment by our count thanks to the second best incentive programs in the country as well as the fifth best tort atmosphere other high points include energy costs 30 below the national average and an educated labor force fueled by its proximity to washington d c and top colleges like the university of virginia and william and mary
1116907 the commonwealths regulatory and legal environments are tough to beat as well as our strong educated labor force
1116908 this best in nation validation speaks volumes to our competitiveness in todays global market its a real honor to receive this recognition from forbes com once but to be named the best state for business three years in a row is a true accomplishment for which we should all be proud
1116909 i learned a long time ago that the work of the staff is absolutely vital to the health and happiness of an organization
1116910 indeed most places would grind to a quick halt a dead stop if the staff suddenly headed for the hills this is certainly true of the college of william amp mary you all are vital vital to what goes on here and you do a marvelous job of holding this place together
1116911 its been a time of change and transition and youve rolled with those changes with terrific grace and focus and determination
1116912 you keep this place moving forward and im so so grateful for that thank you for all that you do for the college of william and mary
1116913 i want to let the nation know that the second oldest university is not using quill pens
1116914 we are using tablet pcs and its my favorite sidekick
1116915 while others achieved significant results with their pilot of the tablet randy served as an inspiration to all involved
1116916 willing to stand in front of class and try new things
1116917 its truly the sense of engagement they felt that i believe made the difference
1116918 she said to be honest were really not that confident that bens ever going be able to complete high school much less college
1116919 i love to learn but im excited to be a researcher and a producer of knowledge instead of strictly a consumer
1116920 i know the college of william and mary has a deep commitment to undergraduate education
1116921 i think there are a lot of wonderful colleges and universities that exist but some tend to focus more on graduate research and sometimes short change maybe inadvertently undergraduate education i think that william and mary while it has great graduate programs is also well known for having a strong undergraduate focus and that attracted me very significantly to william and mary
1116922 unfortunately a lot of students with dyslexia arent always diagnosed at a young age so they struggle for many years until they get a name for the phenomena thats affecting them
1116923 for example when we were studying history we got into our pick up truck in michigan and drove out to gettysburg to get a sense of civil war battles
1116924 the university of michigan was a wonderful experience but i was still reading at a grade school level so there was a severe mismatch between my reading skills and the demands of my college level studies
1116925 so i relied on books on tape and i also used a reader and a scribe
1116926 my dyslexia was still a significant hurdle and i was still a teenager too it wasnt a good match law school was an important failure in my life after my experience at yale i began to reconsider does going off to professional school or graduate school really make sense given my limitations
1116927 the oxbridge oxford cambridge system uses a tutorial system quite extensively so its more kind of one on one meetings with faculty as opposed to traditional lectures with 20 or 30 people in the classroom
1116928 that experience really very much reminded me of the homeschooling experience i had had years earlier working with my mother or other instructors on a one on one basis
1116929 left with more questions than answers and so the next year i kind of migrated my interest from just sociology to sociology and politics
1116930 i think part of learning is learning how to ask good questions and so i asked a lot of questions when i was in a program and was left with answers that i wanted to explore more in depth
1116931 i go to sleep after the monologue of jimmy kimmel at midnight and get up at 4 or 4 30 and start the day being dyslexic requires being more structured it take a little more work with regard to writing spelling and reading and so you have to budget your time and be very focused
1116932 fewer positive profiles of academics that are dyslexic and so im interested in providing a positive message that in spite of learning disabilities one can go on to achieve some degree of success
1116933 because i am dyslexic i realize that different people learn differently and just because you may need to learn differently doesnt mean you are any more or less talented than somebody else
1116934 my whole lifetime ive been a terrific admirer of thomas jefferson
1116935 he had a very well rounded life i certainly do not have anywhere near the brilliance as thomas jefferson but i have the same kind of curiosity to do a number of different things ive always respected his very diverse career and so i am mindful that he was educated at william and mary
1116936 we are pleased that someone of bens talents and varied education will be teaching for our sociology department next year
1116937 the more i delved into the respective authority of the president and congress over our use of force abroad the clearer it became that there are relatively few constitutional certainties about the war powers
1116938 ive been hooked on the mysteries of the war powers ever since
1116939 ensuring that congress has an opportunity to consult meaningfully with the president about significant armed conflicts and that congress expresses its views
1116940 questions of war and peace are among the most fundamental we engage as a country
1116941 the president needs the independent views of congressional leaders when thinking about these questions if the country is to emerge with the wisest policies and with policies that will enjoy both congressional and executive support the constitution does impose one iron demand on the president and congress they must cooperate if any long term american venture of war and peace is to succeed
1116942 war powers of the president and congress who holds the arrows and olive branch
1116943 rather the commission has tried to craft practical ways for the two branches to consult and collaborate
1116944 social and industrial culture of soviet large concrete panel factories in chile and cuba kpd and the politics of prefabrication 1970 1980
1116945 at this point in time people who are for clinton are much more negative than they will be in november
1116946 weve done surveys with activists and what we find is that the more active you were for a losing candidate in the primary the more active youll be for the winning candidate in the general election over time people like the nominee more and more
1116947 kind of an intense person i guess not kind of i am an intense person
1116948 i saw life as being very short and i wanted to make the most of it
1116949 i thought a class like this might merge the two types of students and let them find out what they have in common
1116950 there are really few differences in terms of overall goals
1116951 the deficiencies of mexicos schools could have serious consequences for the united states
1116952 poorly educated immigrants take longer to assimilate and lack the skills that u s companies need to compete
1116953 humans everywhere anthropologists knoiw make meaning together in song laden sacred rituals loud messy conflicts or calm conversations
1116954 it is in creative contingent unpredictable and emotional meaning making that our human nature lies
1116955 he obrador is completely out of touch with the global economy
1116956 if the candidates want to be thought of as rocky balboa they need to act more like him
1116957 some of the highest elevations in virginia beach are only about plus 20 feet above mean sea level
1116958 so as the sea level comes up a foot or two and the storm surge rises on top of that there are significant parts of the city that are at significant risks
1116959 individual sandbar sharks would generally not approach the metal ingots claser than about 24 inches nor attack pieces of cut bait suspended within approximately 12 inches
1116960 perhaps no provision in the constitution causes one to stumble quite so much on a first reading or second or third reading
1116961 there is and apparent non sequitur or disconnection of a sort in midsentence
1116962 these are critically important decisions that must be made by the people in the country and the people who are going to be impacted by that not by international advisers
1116963 if you think of any social relationship shared laughter is one of the markers of success
1116964 a person who tries to be funny and doesnt get a response from the other person thats real failure
1116965 an exploratory moment and it gets publicity which keeps the agenda in front of the public
1116966 ive heard politicians deny that the narcos are involved in elections but its what most people who follow mexican politics believe is happening
1116967 there is a lot of jostling going on regarding who is going to be in charge of mexicos so called war on drugs the merida initiative is like this big pinata different agencies are trying to position themselves to get fixed wing airplanes and helicopters once its struck
1116968 every judge considers pretty seriously if they feel that the defendant has flaunted the conditions for release
1116969 after ad 1200 werowocomoco appears as a truly monumental place of periodic ceremony involving natives from across the region
1116970 there are a lot of different stats but that 320 000 hours is a pretty amazing thing when you think about it
1116971 the power of an hour well spent is pretty significant so when you think about what aggregate impact that can make it is a great thing
1116972 we have already been to the grand canyon and bryce and zion so i think the next trip will be to places that will please her like a small boat cruise in europe
1116973 i didnt plan to do much math but its not turning out that way im helping a graduate student with his thesis
1116974 i find photography which has long been a passion is taking more and more of my time
1116975 and that has inspired me to do more of my own photography
1116976 the class is not so structured that it is intimidating but structured enough that the class is not chaos
1116977 there is a need on this campus for the person who doesnt sit at a desk everyday in front of a computer to learn the basics
1116978 and i wanted the supervisors to feel comfortable with the new equipment
1116979 the response from the supervisors was great they loved gwen their instructor and felt they learned so much that they asked to take part 2 the next year
1116980 many of the residence life housekeeping employees have taken additional classes with it the rita welch center and regular college courses for credit
1116981 the college is an institution of higher learning i think its important for all of the employees to be aware and take advantage of the resources we have available here we do our best to promote these opportunities and provide time during the day for them to participate in classes all in all it is a win win arrangement
1116982 a consistent body of information as opposed to the random way people will learn on their own
1116983 needs to get into mywm send emails and be able to communicate with their supervisors
1116984 the class provides a quiet place for learning no interruptions
1116985 they dont need us to tell them what to do
1116986 somebody who is incarcerated is definitely not a lost cause at all as a parent
1116987 this gives the individuals who brought the children there the opportunity to be in a group and then talk about different things that they are dealing with or maybe their children are dealing with
1116988 usually its about parenting specific things but sometimes its more in general what its like to deal with an incarcerated parent or spouse and how they are coping with this role as single parents
1116989 we have to graph each individuals progress everyone starts out not only at a different point in terms of how long they have been in the program but also at different points in where they are in their life
1116990 if you look at this kind of individual trajectory you see a marked improvement the longer they are in the program
1116991 she brings a depth a kind of a research evaluation depth that we havent had
1116992 i have just gained so much from talking with her about ideas or things to try
1116993 i hate to say that i am serving them because they are giving me the opportunity to get so much more out of it but i do think of it as embodying a lot of the principles associated with service learning by being an engaged citizen in a community and promoting education in the community
1116994 as a researcher i try to look at overall trends
1116995 this brings it back down to the level of the family and allows me to see up close the impact of parental incarceration and visitation with incarcerated parents for children and families
1116996 gain some insight into why they behaved in certain ways and that can help their parenting or their communication and relationship with their child
1116997 this is an opportunity and an intervention for people who maybe wouldnt have otherwise had it
1116998 whatever comes up that they need me ill work it
1116999 jim has served this college for more years than many of us have been alive and he has done so in a manner which can only be described as exemplary
1117000 my life has been blessed by the camaraderie and relationship that has been established with jim hes a real person
1117001 the man will not stop working he never tires of working
1117002 we thought it would be a great opportunity for us to get involved in the community
1117003 because she does such a great job we thought wed put her in this position
1117004 obviously the folks that we cook for are elderly people so we try really hard to give them a menu that they can digest
1117005 i just enjoy my job and i enjoy the people coming up and talking laughing
1117006 sometimes they say you made my day and then they make my day
1117007 thinking about the people that are home and dont have nobody and they dont have a meal and this is all they are getting in a day
1117008 it makes me feel good to know that by doing this they are going to get a meal
1117009 i think that throughout the country its one of the best programs
1117010 when i retire i think thats one of the things ill do is drive meals on wheels because its such a wonderful program
1117011 im really happy that we as food service on the campus have an opportunity to do that because it really says that we can wear different hats not just provide food for the students and catering and everything else but also for the community
1117012 i feel very good about it 50 years on one job
1117013 we are most like a family because everybodys been here for such a long time
1117014 williamsburg was about the only place you could find a job
1117015 after i got into food service i just continued on with it
1117016 when it comes to the bottom line and helping everybody he is probably one of the best guys ive ever worked with and ive done this for 30 some years
1117017 everyone just loves him even though he is mr grump
1117018 we just about almost grew up together were just like brothers
1117019 hes a fine young man and weve done some good things together
1117020 with the football boys i get to talk with them and have a little joke around
1117021 im always up there when i need something to eat
1117022 as soon as i always walk in the house my sister says are you hungry all of them love to cook
1117023 kenya literally felt like the lion king every day with a big sunrise behind the acacia tree and lions and elephants everywhere
1117024 i knew that i really just felt passionate about trying to work with education programs to do conservation and i wanted to try really hard to make photography fit
1117025 i wanted to work on a conservation project in a country that was relatively untouched and pretty receptive to conservation work
1117026 the idea of giving them a new way to look at what they typically wouldnt notice it was an exciting thought
1117027 originally i was skeptical that he could pull it off but i didnt let on i hope
1117028 i cant take much credit for this it was completely roshans idea and he executed it all by himself in my experience student projects usually work out less wonderfully than originally envisioned but this case was very much the opposite
1117029 kenya ended up a good location because they already have a pretty good emphasis on wildlife management
1117030 as far as convincing people to do a conservation project it would be a lot easier there than perhaps working with public school systems in america
1117031 i basically wrote a letter to canon and they followed up on it and said they would just give me discontinued cameras that werent going to be sold anyway
1117032 it was actually really simple and surprisingly less paperwork and meetings than i had thought it would take
1117033 it was literally the most middle of nowhere id ever been
1117034 initially it was very hard to work with them to be honest
1117035 wed take the cameras out just to practice the actual features on the camera and they would take six hundred seven hundred pictures in a day just firing it whenever they saw anything
1117036 the other element of why i decided to do this project was because i think that people are disconnected from conservation efforts especially after talking to a lot of people down there i realized that a lot of conservation is seen as white peoples work where foreigners come in and tell the tribes what to do with their land
1117037 i dont think any individual can convince everybody that conservation is an important thing to do its something they have to understand for themselves hopefully i can assist them getting there but i dont want to be overbearing in my role
1117038 right now im thrilled that on any given day on the news youll see some environmental issue being brought up because the push in general is to have people thinking about it for them to have it on the forefront of their minds
1117039 id like to take environmentalism out of classrooms or if it is involved in classrooms it should be involved in a more fun and local way i think ultimately people need to relate to the field if theyre going to care about it
1117040 cannot drive america out of iraq but we can drive bush out of the white house like we did to carter
1117041 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
1117042 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
1117043 last night my wife and i were part of an historic event as we served as acolytes at a truly extraordinary event at st pauls pomona our rector fr mark halahan married jimmy his long time partner in a nuptial mass that included two other same sex couples who also
1117044 the apology was made in a ceremony to mark three years of dialogue between hindus and christians initiated among others by the reverend karen macqueen better known as mother karen she is deeply influenced by vedanta philosophy and fiercely opposes the conversions for kindness methodology
1117045 i can only say that inclusion is a reality in our diocese and will continue to be for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken

1117059 last week apple quietly stopped distributing netshare put it back up and now appears to have pulled it again but what could we expect it was a piece of software allowing users to transform their iphones into wi fi hotspots

1117069 sanjay jha the newly named president of motorola inc s mobile devices business was greeted by wall street like a hero about to go off to war
1117070 jha is a well known quantity to investors having spent the last 14 years of his career at qualcomm inc most recently as chief operating officer
1117071 but even with those credentials the challenge ahead of jha and the rest of the company is daunting since motorola first disclosed problems in its handset business last year the landscape of the cell phone industry has changed significantly thanks in large part to the debut of the game changing iphone from apple inc
1117072 jha will have to grapple with the fact that the battle for the hearts and minds of cell phone users has shifted from ultra thin cell phones to the fast growing smart phone market where devices can make calls handle e mail juggle schedules and surf the web here the iphone is duking it out primarily with research in motion ltd s blackberry

1117075 let us first go and tell our wives we will be late for dinner and perhaps be away for all of shabbat
1117076 woe to us had you all seized the opportunity and responded together let us proceed to jerusalem had you really believed had you really felt the joy and happiness of the moment the redemption would have come the entire world would have been redeemed the messiah would have arrived and the temple fully built in all its glory would have descended from the sky
1117077 its a deterent so people will think im a cop
1117078 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1117079 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower

1117090 it doesnt matter what side of the fence you were on i dont think you will find anyone in scottish football who had a bad word to say about him it was always a pleasure to be in his company and talk to him his crack was different class

1117094 david murray is on the back foot at rangers by general consent the sectarianism is worse than it is at celtic it was an experience that reminded me again of how widespread and malignant bigotry at ibrox is it is folly not to say a cultural disservice to scotland to denounce oneill for what he said this week rangers in particular have a major problem with bigots
1117095 compare and contrast their shameful behaviour with that of celtic who on the road to seville last season represented scottish football immaculately
1117096 like the rangers orange strip the song follow follow cannot be listed among the great criminal acts it merely offends
1117097 nor can i recall rangers being disparaged in 1972 when they won the cup winners cup a tournament which by definition was painfully inferior to the european cup indeed a prize which many placed third in the list of europes club baubles behind the uefa cup
1117098 please can i be spared any whining from rangers over this and other criticisms
1117099 i want a decent sock thats comfortable that will stay on my foot

1117115 bush has become something of an emperor he will give the command and cruise missiles will fly and aircraft will fly and people will die and yet few of us here are really able to cobble together a great explanation of why this is a good idea of course many of us can give you the 4h club lecture on democracy in the mid east but if you asked any of the flight officers whether they have a clear idea of what the goal of this strike is your answer would sound like something out of a think tank policy paper but its not like kosovo or when we relieved the tsunami victims there everyone could tell you in a sentence what we were here doing
1117116 whats missing is the answer to what the hell are we doing out here threatening this country with all this power last night in the galley an ensign asked what right do we have to tell a sovereign nation that they cant build a nuke i mean the table got ef hutton quiet not so much because the man was asking a question that was off culture but that he was asking a good question in fact the discussion actually followed afterwards topside where someone in our group had to smoke a cigarette the discussion was intelligent but also in lowered voices its like we arent allowed to ask the questions that we always ask before combat its almost as if the average seaman or soldier is doing all the policy work
1117117 yes were going to hit iran big time whatever political discussions that are going on is window dressing and perhaps even a red herring i see whats going on below deck here in the hangars and weapons bays and i have a sick feeling about how its all going to turn out

1117121 realvibez has been able to create a jamaican owned destination website for caribbean music related videos and a strategic partnership with a major content producer like retv is a natural fit with our goals and long term vision for the company and caribbean music as a whole
1117122 we are aggressively focusing on major expansion plans for our distribution network the latest additions to our live satellite feed include guyana and the pacific coast of costa rica but a satellite is not everything in a global marketplace so we are happy to join forces with realvibez tv because we cannot do everything by ourselves and realvibezs approach to the online video market has significant potential which fits right into our expansion strategy
1117123 we are always looking for opportunities to work with content producers who want to leverage the core competencies of our brands and properties we look forward to working closely with retv to execute a great channel and play our part in supporting the growth of caribbean music

1117144 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
1117145 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities the letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity paralyzing mans noblest impulses

1117149 esta es una de las leyes m s importantes que se han promulgado en el gobierno de la presidenta bachelet porque se hace cargo de aspectos centrales desde la dignidad de los trabajadores mejorar su empleabilidad y mejorar su productividad o sea es una ley que apunta al nervio de la productividad de cualquier empresa poniendo el acento en lo que para nosotros es el dato clave la capacidad de sus trabajadores as que creo que es estupendo
1117150 para un trabajador es muy muy importante y pongo el acento en la dignidad porque es la certificaci n del aprendizaje en la vida que es una de las caracter sticas centrales de muchos trabajadores este trabajador que se ha certificado ahora es un sujeto m s atractivo tambi n en otra empresa porque tiene c mo acreditar su conocimiento algo que antes no ten a
1117151 alrededor del 95 de las empresas en el mundo desarrollado y subdesarrollado es pyme y su aporte al empleo alcanza el 60
1117152 la contribuci n de las pymes al producto nacional en chile es la mitad de lo que deber a ser s lo 24 comparado con m s del 50 en un pa s desarrollado no estamos produciendo como debi ramos es necesario capacitar y est n los medios para hacerlo
1117153 no hay que vivir centrado en el producto ni en las ventajas competitivas porque se transforma en una obsesi n por competir por imitar y habr una oferta no diversificada lo nico que los diferenciar ser el precio y los clientes elegir n al que cobre m s barato esa f rmula es un desastre para las pymes as no pueden competir ni ser competitivas
1117154 no confrontar al competidor importante sino establecer una opci n distinta buscar nichos y originalidad en un espacio que no sea central para ste por ejemplo ir a reas rurales en las que no est n otras empresas y tener una posici n dominante nunca perder de vista que hay que centrarse en el cliente y lograr diferenciarse entregando una propuesta de valor nica
1117155 la infraestructura de costos de las pymes debe asegurar modularidad y escalabilidad
1117156 tenemos un sesgado sistema educacional recursos para la educaci n hay pero tambi n hay falencias en el sistema de ense anza
1117157 con 200 d lares en 3 minutos una persona abre una empresa
1117158 hoy no hay grandes barreras los costos de incorporaci n son m s alcanzables que antes la corfo tiene un papel relevante pues est haciendo cosas significativas y ha disminuido las barreras para no dificultar los tr mites pero a pesar de eso siguen existiendo trabas
1117159 si no funciona bien una empresa d jela que muera
1117160 hay ocasiones en que a la tercera o cuarta vez le empieza a ir bien el fracaso es un gran aprendiz no hay que tenerle tanto miedo
1117161 hay estad sticas p simas de las pymes en el uso de la inform tica sin embargo es la herramienta m s poderosa para el acercamiento con el cliente y dentro del sistema con otras empresas proveedoras
1117162 al ser chicas son m s flexibles generan respuestas r pidas est n libres de la burocracia de las f bricas m s grandes y es m s estimulante y motivador trabajar en ellas as atrae m s f cilmente a los talentos que consideran un gran desaf o trabajar en ellas de esta forma el tama o se puede transformar en una ganancia
1117163 en el mundo desarrollado una idea no muere nunca por falta de plata la plata existe en todos lados otra cosa es que no la sepan invertir
1117164 pero los problemas no se solucionan con dinero chile tiene una estupenda infraestructura pero necesita cambiar los estatutos que regulan a las pymes
1117165 hoy los problemas se concentran m s en el manejo y la gesti n empresarial y en la falta de capacidad negociadora que no se resuelven con recursos financieros hay que mejorar las condiciones de capacitaci n de la gente y el equipamiento en las empresas falta capacidad de transferencia tecnol gica y educaci n en gesti n y que las personas se involucren en esos procesos
1117166 mi intenci n es reflexionar sobre c mo hacer una estrategia ganadora con resultados significativos c mo establecer la categor a adecuada entorno eficiente estructura y costo cu les son los elementos de una buena gesti n en las pymes c mo se maneja una gesti n exitosa el desarrollo de una estrategia ganadora c mo resolver dilemas aprender a que aparentes debilidades se transformen en una ventaja como por ejemplo el tama o de una empresa
1117167 lo importante es guiar al empresario sobre c mo debe manejar su empresa no decirle c mo mejorar el producto qu debe hacer una pyme en cuanto a su capacidad de gesti n c mo segmentar al mercado y c mo situarse en el sistema
1117168 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1117169 they said i need to come to a place on sunday morning where i dont experience racism
1117170 we are the church together another book that looks at interracial churches says whites often say that church should transcend race
1117171 theyd say cant we just get along without talking about race all the time
1117172 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this religion
1117173 everyone understands the rules the lingo the mind set except you
1117174 it was invaluable but i didnt know it at the time
1117175 the fear there was people would think i was chinese
1117176 there would be a flood of all these asians coming in and what would we do then
1117177 if theres not any tension we probably havent done too well
1117178 if one group feels too comfortable weve probably neglected another group
1117179 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1117180 as long as the top person the senior pastor is white power sort of resides with whites
1117181 but when that shifts it does something psychologically to people people usually leave
1117182 a black church sermon that could be understood as impassioned might be interpreted as angry and defensive by a white congregation
1117183 taking one dominant identity and forcing everyone to fit into it
1117184 if it can be written or thought it can be filmed
1117185 i write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourselves in the house of god which is the church of god the pillar stylos and ground of the truth

1117220 one morning in june rio de janeiro residents awoke to a beeping text message on their cell phones
1117221 obviously i wouldnt have run a cover just to get attention i ran the cover because i thought it had something to say
1117222 the idea that we would publish a cover saying these things literally i think is just not in the vocabulary of what we do and who we are weve run many many satirical political covers ask the bush administration how many
1117223 it seemed to me that depicting the concept would show it as the fear mongering ridiculousness that it is

1117340 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1117341 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1117342 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects

1117361 there were not formal rules in this area so the basis for action they are taking may be questionable
1117362 there will be a lot of detail in the orders that well need to examine before we know which legal avenues are available to us
1117363 in our view and our ideal world it would be nice to see some congressional legislation that spells out clearly what the authority is
1117364 we are concerned that a broad assertion of fcc jurisdiction could essentially suggest that the agency has authority without any clear guidance and limits to regulation of broadband and internet matters
1117365 the great brilliant moment when prisoners in the gulag learned that ronald reagan had proclaimed the soviet union an evil empire before the entire world

1117392 as theyre seeing their profits squeezed and their sales move downwards theyre looking to recover that margin from somewhere and the way theyre going to do that is by cutting back on any plans they had to employ new staff
1117393 so importantly at the moment its not about laying staff off but it is saying very clearly that theyre not looking to create any new jobs in the december quarter
1117394 if the economy continues to experience some bumpiness what they may find is that increased competition for the retail dollar will force them to have to alter their plans to raise those prices

1117444 we believe its important to expose our residents to life after the grove living here is pretty sweet with no worries about roommates not paying rent or bills and the luxury of having a full amenity package at their fingertips we dont want them having total culture shock when its time to enter the real world
1117445 we know college is stressful so we help balance that stress with a lot of fun we put together themed parties like peace love grove event where students wear tie dyed grove shirts love beads and participate in green days
1117446 other ways we help residents relax are through fitness classes pool parties monday night football parties and movie nights
1117447 our events are successful because they are led and organized by our community assistants peers attending the same university when residents feel a part of something they are more likely to stay where they are making our residents better makes the grove a better place
1117448 one way we help residents is through designing programs to help them look at things from a different vantage point for example in one of our past events residents helped blow up hot air balloons and took tethered balloon rides illustrating how different things look when you see them from a new perspective

1117512 the online home for a 17th century british particular baptist pastor
1117513 hercules collins is one of the great figures from our baptist heritage a pastor who suffered much for the cause of christ and left a great legacy for generations that followed there is something especially compelling about the witness of a man who was oppressed and imprisoned for his faith in our lord jesus christ the witness of hercules collins as pastor prisoner and preacher is worthy of the closest attention in our own times we are indebted to michael haykin and steve weaver for bringing hercules collins to life for a new generation
1117514 the secret of collinss courage and strength lay in his relationship with the lord christ the enormous contemporary value of reading his life and writings is not just in its exposition of his evangelistic methodology and its indirect comments on todays broader theological scene but in the inspiration it gives to the heart of each christian for growth in grace and deeper spirituality
1117515 we are indebted to michael haykin and steve weaver for these carefully chosen selections for too long baptists have had little access to the richness of their theological tradition we have a great past and many able servants have given their lives to the cause of our churches and yet so few of their works have been reprinted this book continues a very encouraging recent trend in which the best works are being restored to print may the lord bless this book and the efforts of its editors

1117575 figures such as these indicate the extent to which consumers are prepared to alter their behaviour in one way this can be seen as proof of consumer resilience in times of economic hardship it seems britons are making necessary changes to their lifestyles rather than sliding further into debt for example its encouraging to note that the total number of insolvencies in england and wales in the first quarter of 2008 was actually down more than 13 per cent on the same period a year before

1117588 to start with the u s government should lead the way by requiring that a growing percentage of new cars be built with dual fuel capability these dual fuel cars would have both an electric engine and an auxiliary gasoline engine to augment it
1117589 a dryer outlet will give most of a charge in an hour or a full charge in less than 3 hours with a 110 volt outlet its still easily charged overnight with a 200 amp off board charger the tango can be charged to 80 in about 10 minutes

1117591 and god said let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so

1117593 perhaps the most famous use of the hasselblad camera was during the landed on the moon almost all of the still photographs taken during these missions used specially modified hasselblad cameras hasselblads traditional v system cameras are still widely used by professional and serious amateur photographers
1117594 will become so rare and so expensive that the average joe wont be able to afford it
1117595 as spouses and parents jeanne and joy deserve the same protections that every other family in new york state enjoys
1117596 blue cross amp blue shield of western new york must follow the laws of new york state and treat them as they do every other married couple
1117597 all we want is for our family to be treated fairly
1117598 its heartbreaking that we need to go to court so our family can find some security
1117599 the martinez decision was an important step toward the day when all of new yorks families can live with respect and dignity
1117600 we must now ensure the law is enforced so that all of new yorks married couples are treated fairly and lobby our legislators to pass the marriage bill so that no new yorkers have to leave the state to protect their families
1117601 we applaud blue cross amp blue shield of western new york for following the law and treating all married couples the same
1117602 families who were denied coverage up until this point will now be able to protect themselves with health care coverage

1117606 a 25 percent drop in fertility is the equivalent of a 25 percent drop in the reproductive population it remains to be seen whether other species exhibit the same effect but translated to commercially and ecologically important species such as lobsters crabs mussels and fish acidification would have far reaching consequences

1117611 many people feel that the only measure is the bottom line however a survey of 3 000 businesses showed the benefits of customer service this found that where there was high customer satisfaction then on average bills were paid at least 14 days earlier than where there was poor customer satisfaction so customer service creates money
1117612 reducing customer defections can boost profits by 25 85 in 73 of cases the organisation made no attempt to persuade dissatisfied customers to stay even though 35 said that a simple apology would have prevented them moving to the competition

1117614 new yorkers do not need the state judging which video games are appropriate and which arent
1117615 parents not government committees should be responsible for making those judgments if the legislature wants to reduce youth violence it should fund educational programs to teach students conflict resolution skills
1117616 state appointed officials would review the standards by which the industry establishes video game ratings and the state would then require these ratings to be placed on packaging as a condition of sale the bill clearly creates a regulatory scheme that would infringe on the free speech rights of video game creators retailers and their customers
1117617 it is our hope that the governor will stand up for the first amendment and reject this bill
1117618 the nypd is acting like an ornery child plugging its fingers in its ears and refusing to listen to the fair and impartial ruling of the judiciary
1117619 our justice system has already rejected this pattern of withholding information from the public and i have full confidence it will do so again new yorkers have a right to know if the nypd is engaging in racial profiling
1117620 every year hundreds of thousands of innocent new yorkers are stopped searched and interrogated by the police for doing nothing more than walking down the street
1117621 the nypd has given information about these stops to organizations in michigan now it is time for the department to be held accountable to new yorkers

1117644 team sununu will be donating to charity the 10 000 received during this 2008 campaign cycle from northern lights pac the campaign had previously donated to charity contributions received from veco employees who pled guilty to wrongdoing
1117645 when it comes to ethics and showing that you have a real concern for ethical issues then what you do is make a check from your campaign organization that is sitting on as we all know that is sitting on a lot of money which came from these sources and give it away give it to charity
1117646 his failure to do so i think shows that he just doesnt get it when it comes to some of these ethical issues
1117647 john sununu puts the oil industry ahead of middle class new hampshire families and in return he gets dirty money from ted stevens and his friends in big oil by keeping 39 000 in campaign contributions linked to an alleged felon and the oil industry sununu is showing his vote has been bought

1117672 i thought the light was yellow when i started to the u turn but the officer didnt see it that way
1117673 i think there needs to be a grown up or patrolman school patrolman at all these corners
1117674 if it becomes too large with kids well break it down and move them maybe a half a block a block or two away on either side of that
1117675 thats one of our biggest concerns is that youre going to have a child standing there and there wont be a bus to pick the child up

1117678 you get to the top and it kind of takes your breath away because its so hot up here
1117679 i thought that the a c was just not keeping up and i put my son to bed and realized that he slept with no air and he woke up really really hot
1117680 when we go into a house that hasnt been running its just like it is outside
1117681 sometimes its hotter than outside because you can actually go outside with a little bit of wind and its actually better than your house
1117682 the higher the temperature the more apt it is to break down because its running all the time
1117683 running and starting is going to cost you a lot more money than just running all the time
1117684 if youre wanting to do 72 on a 105 degree day its probably not going to do it
1117685 i dont know if weve ever had a day thats been that hot just trying to get the job done
1117686 school starts in a couple of weeks so weve got to get it done
1117687 granted thats the norm but the norm is killing people

1117692 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1117693 i felt that since we represented defense with our gloves we should do something to honor the best in that area
1117694 and what better way than with a glove a golden glove at that
1117695 at the time it was very common for pitchers to throw out to the umpire baseballs that would be doctored in some way to affect the pitching
1117696 when you look around mount prospect you see my dad
1117697 he really had a youthful spirit about him he was very proud of that gold glove
1117698 we wanted something that would both capture a sense of the history of our congregation its priorities and values over the years and something that would convey the spirit were being led to in the future

1117706 we have gay marriage in massachusetts and california and the sky hasnt fallen
1117707 which is lost to many i must add but not to the 70 year old man in the
1117708 yes i do and all they keep writing about is that we will get to vote on it
1117709 well i think i need to inform you that we have had equal marriage in massachusetts for over 4 years now and recently too in california
1117710 remember the petition you signed to stop gay marriage well we want you to remember to get out and vote for the actual legislation
1117711 that you have signed this petition we would like to explain to you what this legislation would do to the state constitution and to families and to lgbt people
1117712 were disappointed but this ruling does not affect the campaign against prop 8 in any way
1117713 teacher this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery 5now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women to death what do you say
1117714 let the person among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her
1117715 dear lady g where are your accusers h hasnt anyone condemned you
1117716 i dont condemn you either go home and from now on do not sin any more
1117717 you do realize that that line was added to a very late version of that gospel
1117718 do you really believe that jesus was saying that adultery was ok
1117719 obama does not believe that faith based groups are an alternative to government or secular nonprofits or that theyre better at lifting people but what he does believe is that we all have to work together to meet the challenges of the 21st century
1117720 same sex couples could provide the loving homes that these children needed
1117721 both which is needed in order for a child to be an emotionally intellectually physically and cognitively healthy member of society
1117722 made massachusetts better because now couples at least on the state level are able to protect themselves their assets and most importantly their families so massachusetts is much better now that we have marriage equality
1117723 senator kerry will not take your marriages away from you
1117724 in massachusetts gay marriage is a matter of settled law and there is no reason to change the law
1117725 this is a good day for the people of arizona
1117726 the people of arizona will be able to decide the definition of marriage rather than the courts or the politicians
1117727 to end this session today means we all walk out of here tainted besmirched
1117728 i am extremely disappointed this has melted down to this level
1117729 homosexual orgies on public beaches and other places in massachusetts have increased since gay marriage was forced on the people this activity has been advertised and spread across the country with results like we have seen in provincetown
1117730 well it helps the others to learn about respect modesty morality selflessness and myriad of other family values and issues that are raised by the homosexual lifestyle
1117731 and remember the experience of having both a mother and a father has been proven throughout time to have lasting benefits and is the accepted standard around the world
1117732 for young children to be exposed to anything else puts them at a disadvantage immediately because they are not normal normal in this case being the true meaning of the word
1117733 emotions are then skewed in these situations that make the child more susceptible to having behavioral social and psychological problems
1117734 well it helps the others to learn about respect modesty morality selflessness and myriad of other family values and issues that are raised by the homosexual lifestyle
1117735 respect modesty morality selflessness and myriad of other family values
1117736 respect modesty morality selflessness aretimeless virtues that the overwhelming majority of gay parents practice and teach daily
1117737 children see selfish disrespectful and heathen homosexuals all the time
1117738 sorry tom but its you who have it all wrong
1117739 i never said eliminate the gays that is just your battle cry for anything that challenges you you cannot believe it when someone stands up to your face and tells you like it is all i am saying is have a civil union and shut up
1117740 and a child is far better off with a mother and a father
1117741 disrespectful slurring and intimidating people ktn is the perfect example anti neighbor and anti american and lastly
1117742 heathen its always about sex transgendered people folsom street fair pride marches bathroom stall predators cape cod orgies etc etc

1117748 our state now recognizes that an individuals capacity to establish a loving and long term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individuals sexual orientation
1117749 today the california supreme court took a giant leap to ensure that everybody not just in the state of california but throughout the country will have equal treatment under the law
1117750 and watch your mouth with your slurs or you will be slurred as well you faggot
1117751 the very purpose of a bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts

1117754 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1117755 the area that is causing some concern is that although its asian growth is good it is slower than it was and if you extrapolate from that then growth is going to be really slow
1117756 this ruling means that its now harder for film companies to prevent their prop designers from making money out of their own products it makes it harder for the film companies to tie up the ip so loosens up the industry

1117761 uneasy about the law which was put in place for discrimination purposes
1117762 rep hill you clenched your teeth and took deep breaths during the fight for equal marriage here in massachusetts possibly expecting it to hurt alot but it didnt
1117763 there are very few laws on the books that i can say that im ashamed that theyre on the books this is a very simple law contrived in shame and it exists in shame and we ought to wipe it off the books
1117764 this 1913 law was and is a racist law but i want to keep this racist law on the books in the commonwealth of massachusetts in order to stop out of state gays from marrying here
1117765 my understanding is that the 1913 law was an attempt to standardize interstate transactions and yes some acts of discrimination did indeed take place but the law in massachusetts was not crafted by individuals intent upon discrimination contrary to diane wilkersons and your charges
1117766 hold in roth the higher expected return relative to the traditional or 401k

1117769 i think journeys got it figured out these rockers that have great songs but have to be sung in the stratosphere just need to find a new youngblood to sing their hits and then take it on the road foreigner should totally do that
1117770 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1117771 as a result of today the bush administration has failed to achieve a single ounce in reductions of smog soot mercury or global warming pollution from power plants
1117772 the power generating industry had already invested billions and billions of dollars in anticipation of the trading market theyre not happy with this development
1117773 if elected obama wont let himself be branded as the man who lost iraq after it had been won hed give a speech in february or march to the effect that the reality we face has changed and we must change with reality
1117774 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1117775 friends who get together once every few years but still enjoy those get togethers
1117776 youd rather see that stupid piece of garbage titanic continue its reign of terror as the highest grossing film of all time you clearly hated heath ledger then because any criticism against the dark knight is equivalent to pissing on ledgers grave
1117777 as i said in my original comment these studies arent conclusive they need to be duplicated
1117778 yet i think they are enough to indicate that you shouldnt assume all liberals are stupid
1117779 it is at least likely that they were conducted under proper scientific conditions to remove the affect of researcher bias
1117780 since they seem quite intelligent they are probably liberals based on the results of their own studies
1117781 the president does anyone who still doesnt believe in global warming just has their head in the sand but thats a different topic
1117782 catholic schools do tend to perform better than public schools which is not surprising since they also tend to have lower student to teacher ratios
1117783 however it does not necessarily follow that your catholic high school was one of the ones that performed higher than the average public school
1117784 therefore it also doesnt necessarily follow that being an honors student at your particular high school means that you are exceptionally smart
1117785 it also doesnt necessarily follow that being an honors student at your particular high school means that you are exceptionally smart im willing to give you the benefit of the doubt i believe youre intelligent
1117786 i simply dont believe that you have much in the way of critical thinking skills
1117787 i didnt presume anything the phrase to which your responding is a quote from the article to which i linked thats why there are quotation marks around it
1117788 stds are a huge problem in society but their spread is not caused by liberal thinking
1117789 its caused by promiscuity and a lack of prophylactic precaution
1117790 as it happens i have been married and monogamous for fifteen years
1117791 and yet the some of the most conservative people i know are also the most promiscuous
1117792 by linking liberal thinking with stds which only adds credance to my original comment
1117793 mensa there are a lot of strange people in it
1117794 but they dont all know how to use their intelligence
1117795 there is not a one to one correlation between iq and political orientation which is what your post implies
1117796 i dont know if you have friends but if you do youll understand
1117797 they stand for nothing other than getting people of like intelligence together on the other hand ive had rather amazing discussions with my fellow mensans
1117798 i mentioned my affiliation with mensa only to disprove your implication that all liberals were stupid
1117799 you have turned that around to mean that since mensans are stupid i am in fact stupid
1117800 if you believe that high iq academic and professional success financial security and a stable happy life are signs of low intelligence i have all of these things i am not bragging
1117801 im simply telling you that being a liberal doesnt preclude you from these things
1117802 youre proud that you spend your time baiting people into arguments
1117803 it seems a pretty sad way to spend your time actually
1117804 i dont really know why i felt like doing it today
1117805 people like you are too full of hate to think rationally
1117806 hey i got a uncle i hate he always wants to wrassle with the mule and he gets all wore out and the mule gets all wore out no come to think of it i dont hate him either
1117807 i guess i felt i needed to vent for which you have been very helpful
1117808 go on baiting people into one sided arguments based on fallacious premises
1117809 if it allows you to believe youve done something useful during the day so that you can sleep at night so be it
1117810 people who do things badly dunning has found in studies conducted with a graduate student justin kruger are usually supremely confident of their abilities more confident in fact than people who do things well
1117811 the smartest kids turned into the most broad minded and progressive adults for example the most intelligent kids turned out 20 years later to be much more tolerant of other races they were also much more supportive of working mothers rejecting the notion that pre school children will suffer without a stay at home mother in general the sharpest kids came to embrace much less traditional moral values and were much more apt to challenge authority they were also much less cynical as adults more trusting that the political system can do good
1117812 the brain neurons of liberals and conservatives fire differently when confronted with tough choices suggesting that some political divides may be hard wired
1117813 not every liberal is smarter than every conservative but the current data shows that on the average we are
1117814 not every liberal is smarter than every conservative but the current data shows that on the average we are
1117815 its like looking a moebius strip trying to figure out where the starting point is
1117816 for example the most intelligent kids turned out 20 years later to be much more tolerant of other races
1117817 they were also much more supportive of working mothers rejecting the notion that pre school children will suffer without a stay at home mother
1117818 in general the sharpest kids came to embrace much less traditional moral values and were much more apt to challenge authority
1117819 they were also much less cynical as adults more trusting that the political system can do good
1117820 of course these studies arent conclusive and they also only show trends not absolutes
1117821 to say that liberals are stupid is not only untrue in the specific im a liberal who is also a member of mensa
1117822 this study that stupid people think theyre smarter than they are however does explain to some degree why the current administration has failed on multiple levels and still thinks they are doing a terrific job
1117823 thats a long response to my comment you really have a lot of time on your hands dont you
1117824 i myself work full time and am working on my phd at night so im not as free to write such long comments
1117825 the first article i linked to was about a study
1117826 the so called rental income paid to dogwood inn leaseholders actually came from money paid by other investors who purchased leases not from any vacationers renting the rooms

1117841 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1117842 he looked at me and i swear he knew who i was
1117843 it appears that the democrats are so beholding to the wacko leftist groups that they have decided that they are more important than the lowly working class that put them in office
1117844 the debt is growing more and more out of control energy is at a crisis the economy is wobbling around so many important issues having major problems so what do they do go on vacation no need to say more
1117845 i am sorely disappointed in the way the news is portraying this
1117846 i see this as being sensationalized for the sake of a story
1117847 is it not always better safe than sorry when it comes to your child
1117848 i wonder how you would feel if it were indeed your own child
1117849 umfassenden bem hungen um eine verbesserung des schutzes von kindern vor gewalt und insbesondere vor sexualstraftaten

1117856 all public records concerning or relating to any arrest and or booking of edwin ramos
1117857 largely as a result of san franciscos self imposed sanctuary status
1117858 the murder of these three innocents is a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of illegal alien sanctuary policies
1117859 edwin ramos should have been deported long ago instead san francisco authorities put him back on the streets and now three people are dead
1117860 rumors have been circulating around capitol hill that a few activist groups have renewed their surge and have begun lobbying full force for a bill introduced by presidential candidate sen barack obama d il the bill has already passed out of the senate foreign relations committee without any public hearings and it also passed the house earlier this year it is important to note that both of these votes were voice votes which was a deliberate strategy of the congressional majority so that no record would be kept of those who voted in favor of this problematic bill
1117861 while senator barack obama struggles to keep the public in the dark about the nature of his pro u n global poverty act a recent bay area interfaith leaders luncheon was held to lobby for senate passage of the bill whose cost has been estimated at 845 billion
1117862 meanwhile a concerned parent alerted us to the fact that a christian preschool in long island new york was handing out a coloring page for children which included a plea for congress to pass obamas global poverty act
1117863 the enclosed sheet said dear senator at preschool i learned to thank god for the food i eat
1117864 the pictures to be colored included what appeared to be an angel holding a bowl of food with a valentine heart on the robe and the bowl and a basket with apples
1117865 this amounts to a tax of over 2 000 on each man woman and child in the united states the foreign aid budget now stands at 300 billion the act would add the additional expenditure to the already huge amount allocated to assist the world
1117866 through a global tax preferably on carbon emitting fossil fuels
1117867 we will need in the end to put real resources in support of our hopes a global tax on carbon emitting fossil fuels might be the way to begin
1117868 it began as a united nations humanitarian aid program called oil for food but it ended up with saddam hussein pocketing billions to become the biggest graft generating machine ever and enriching some of americas most forceful opponents at the united nations
1117869 i believe the u n parts of it have been corrupt for years but this went to a whole new level
1117870 tax on the rental value of land and natural resources
1117871 it would be terrific to have an article from what new york times editors dont seem to understand is that john mccain doesnt base his positions on what the liberal media wants but what he knows to be right for america
1117872 we havent even really had a conversation in over five years let it go
1117873 we could care less what your are paying and what will happen to national security we are going on vacation
1117874 its a representative government our constituents are outraged at the way the democrats have run this congress into the ground and done nothing on their behalf and we were not going to have our peoples voices silenced and were not going to let this issue go because its not about republican or democrat its about american s
1117875 working americans cannot afford to wait for gas price relief just because the speaker wants them to
1117876 that is why they went on a five week paid vacation without doing their job
1117877 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the hand maidens of the oil companies
1117878 thats what you saw on the republican side of the aisle
1117879 where im from its considered rude to ask someone who they are voting for
1117880 what if there still was polygamy outside of colorado sects what if it was legal and it didnt involve abusing children and child brides

1117895 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1117896 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the olympics greatly
1117897 the threat from east turkestan forces exist but their capabilities are limited
1117898 this is focused on supporting the host city it was to support denver and our home community
1117899 the reason this loophole was not closed when the federal election commission considered it in 2003 was that the political parties that dominated the commission wanted the loophole to continue to support what is the biggest campaign ad of the election
1117900 it was even expanded to include businesses that had no local connection whatsoever to the host city
1117901 its just the level we thought would be appropriate to be a good corporate citizen in our hometown
1117902 the donation was not because it was the democrats it was because it was in denver
1117903 sponsoring the denver host committee gives us a great platform to demonstrate our commitment to the city and its small business community as well as to showcase our environmental initiatives

1117917 they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1117918 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain
1117919 i told them i needed my medicine but they didnt give me anything
1117920 she told me after a month in detention that she still hadnt seen a doctor

1117972 lunsford as browns chief legislative liaison did push for a change in the gas tax formula at the time the tax was 9 cents a gallon since then the price of gas has more than tripled with the tax rising to 21 1 cents per gallon
1117973 if six cents makes a huge difference then lunsford is finally admitting his automatic gas tax increases are hurting kentucky families
1117974 i was surprised when he bragged about raising taxes in the first place this is not someone kentuckians want representing them in the u s senate
1117975 lunsfords record on gas taxes is clear and consistent he still supports higher gas taxes he admits that when they go up families feel the pain and he does not care what these taxes do to the cost of gas at the pump

1117993 dont eat the marshmallow yet the secret to sweet success in work and life
1117994 joachim de posada a world renowned motivational speaker found the answer in a landmark stanford university study of children who were able to delay gratification in the form of a marshmallow theyd been given to eat with the promise that theyd be rewarded with an additional marshmallow if they resisted eating the first for fifteen minutes
1117995 posada saw that the key difference between success and failure is not merely hard work or superior intelligence but the ability to delay gratification

1118006 we have one game plan but there are pattern variations with which we can play around
1118007 if i want to change my game plan i will have to change the players
1118008 when you look at the skills of the players in the extended squad one comes to the conclusion that those who are on the field and those who are not are more or less the same
1118009 therefore the game plan wont change when someone is injured there may be a difference in physical attributes and speed but our style will remain more or less the same
1118010 that is where we will be working towards for the next four years

1118012 i learnt of my removal when a journalist phoned the night before i left for an official visit in china three weeks ago i thought it was just media speculation and brushed it off
1118013 i was shocked to read in south african newspapers quoting anonymous sources saying i was fired as premier and people in china started asking questions it was humiliating
1118014 information was leaked to the press with no attempt to actually call and inform me i was not given any opportunity to state my case as the law permits
1118015 i expected them to give me a service delivery audit report and show me where i have failed but they said abantu bathi people say you have failed

1118302 i dont know if you have already seen this but i thought you would share in my horror amusement what to expect if lolita transitions to highstreet fashion
1118303 the world of fashion which for being about people who likes showing off their superficiality and hedonism via clothes always serves as a calculator of liberty in any city is lamentably the fucking community of passive consumers par excellence from tokyo the distinct groups like gothic lolitas ganguro gyaru kawaii and other homogeneous the only thing they do is repeating theirselves and perhaps they dont even need to buy more clothes already the properly called fashionistas are just the same bullshit or they are mere copy of the magazines or they are fucking layers and layers of expensive clothes

1118311 what does lefthand sell after reading your website it appears that youre a storage software company
1118312 so at the day job were looking at implementing a san along with moving server to something virtual vmware virtual iron or xensource we like the offerings from lefthand networks for the san its a software based san approach will allow us to grow as we need weve got the quotes from them but the execs are still leary about spending that much money its a typical battle that everyone in it fights but were finally making progress last weekend lefthand released their san iq as a vmware appliance this is very very awesome this allows us to test the functionality of it on our network without getting the vendor in here with a san on loan that we end up buying because weve already started using it on our production network weve got an aix server setup with our production data and have it connected via iscsi to the appliances setup in a two node cluster testing so far has been really good over a 100mbit network speeds are similar to the ssa drives our production aix server has will definitely update when we have tested it more

1118320 i try to think about a total look that is clothes accessories make up and the hairdo every single aspect of the catwalk i see the outfits and accessories as parts of an entire universe of fashion
1118321 sometimes people ask me to do a styling job for a magazine or for advertising and they give me a general theme and im free to do anything i want with it so my decision has an impact on what a model gets to wear on the sets and all the rest but there are also times when i happen to be working with people who are very specific about what they want and my job then is just to go out and find the clothes

1118499 ive always wanted to be a writer but i never had any ideas that i liked in those rare times i actually had an idea i immediately dismissed it as derivative or puerile in short i really didnt believe in myself nor did i give myself a chance to try to rise above my inhibitions and self doubts i had my work my family my responsibilities there would be time for such folly later ah yes later that lie we tell ourselves about our passions im busy now ill get to it later but we dont do we its a convenient bucket into which we can throw the things we secretly truly want the most but are too afraid to pursue we throw them in believing that we arent stifling ourselves we believe our own lie and go on with our boring lives not realizing the violence wed just committed to our own souls 2007 was a life changing year for me amid all of the turmoil and there was a lot of turmoil two things allowed for a third to happen which in turn changed everything first my father in law died and with him many untold stories shortly afterwards i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes which while not life threatening not if i control it which i do certainly does make one well aware of ones own mortality and the need to take control of ones life rather than sitting passively and moving from day to day along some kind of conveyor belt moving ever forwards with your later bucket sitting in front of you always ahead of you my friend carla was carrying around no plot no problem by chris baty and told me what it was all about i had tried to join nanowrimo some years back and never wrote a single word it too went into the later bucket and sat there staring at me with those big round guilt inducing eyes but something in me had woken up and i went out and bought a copy of the book and read most of it in a single evening within a day i had an idea and a rough plot outline and then it was november 1st and i was off and running i finished my 50 002nd word on november 30th at 9 30pm and raced home from the write in i was attending in providence to upload my finished novel everyone had gone to bed early so i was alone in my little celebration but in that moment i felt more alive than i had felt in ages and thats when i noticed it my later bucket had been knocked over and there sitting right in front of me were all of those things i said i would get to all of those secret desires i had been hiding ignoring or pretending werent there i scooped them all up dusted them off and threw out the ones that no longer applied or interested me here i am seven months later i bought and have been teaching myself to play the guitar i am starting a new podcast which will collect recordings of stories from anyone who is willing to let me record them because everyone has a great story to tell i have a new copy of drawing on the right side of the brain and much more i have been creative and alive this year and i already have a lot of story ideas running around my head i cant wait for november 1st

1118657 glad youre able to relax with a ton of that reeking stuff parked in the front yard
1118658 no doll theres literally a ton of cow dung right out there on the circular drive
1118659 i dont know what the hell you ordered but thats what you got so whats your plan baby i happen to have a shovel in your size
1118660 one youre not stupid you only like to pretend you are
1118661 two thank god i dont have a wife with my bad luck she might have been just like you
1118662 este puerto falla al instalar windows xp asi que solo trabaja con unidades opticas cd dvd
1118663 do more than belong participate do more than care help do more than believe practice do more than be fair be kind do more than forgive forget do more than dream work
1118664 when you see a new trail or footprint you do not know follow it to the point of knowing
1118665 the first and simplest emotion which we discover in the human mind is curiosity
1118666 it is a shameful thing to be weary of inquiry when what we search for is excellent
1118667 curiosity is in great and generous minds the first passion and the last
1118668 i think at a childs birth if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift that gift would be curiosity
1118669 be curious always for knowledge will not acquire you you must acquire it
1118670 i think knowing what you cannot do is more important than knowing what you can
1118671 it is not good to know more unless we do more with what we already know
1118672 the essence of knowledge is having it to apply it not having it to confess your ignorance
1118673 i would have the studies elective scholarship is to be created not by compulsion but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge the wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself the marking is a system for schools not for the college for boys not for men and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor
1118674 the trouble with the world is not that people know too little but that they know so many things that aint so
1118675 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1118676 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1118677 why do you keep calling your brother when you have a computer problem why cant you let me try to figure it out
1118678 better to live on a corner of the roof than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife
1118679 prohibits teaching public school students in language other than english for more than two years

1118684 my motivation stems from the fact that i love this game and i never stopped playing it whether its a pickup game with deion sanders
1118685 published in one of the gulf states carried a serious analytical piece critical of al jazeera
1118686 what is frightening about that number isnt that 98 percent of arab
1118687 the station not only repeatedly interviewed the hero but brazenly threw
1118688 all arabs should re examine their understanding of what characterizes a hero
1118689 it certainly works for al jazeera just ask 98 percent of arab political science professors
1118690 will comprehend the following as they have done each year for the past seven years the teen leadership of the ezra youth organization here in jerusalems northern suburbs will hold a public
1118691 bon cest un casque de chantier que tu veux quoi
1118692 jack san you want yojis advice about the babes you come to yoji with respect
1118693 keep up the great work i check your site very frequently
1118694 many studies show that a sense of humour is sexually attractive to women but weve found that self deprecating humour is the most attractive of all
1118695 people who used this humour were considered to be far more desirable as mates
1118696 it is a risky form of humour because it can draw attention to ones real faults thereby diminishing the status in the eyes of others
1118697 think about the secondary school child whom nobody liked who makes fun of his shortcomings
1118698 his peers mocked him and he was considered more pathetic than he was previously
1118699 this is high risk seduction it is not for everyone
1118700 this is only the second time ive been a best man i hope i did ok that time
1118701 the couple in question are at least still talking to me unfortunately theyre not actually talking to each other
1118702 the divorce came through a couple of months ago but im assured it had absolutely nothing to do with me paula knew piers had slept with her sister before i mentioned it in the speech
1118703 since sex is our full time job were on top of all the latest trends and techniques
1118704 is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just glad to see me
1118705 im the mother of a recovering alcoholic who sought help years ago from members of the rabbinate who vehemently denied that there were jewish alcoholics she was fortunate that she found alcoholics anonymous and the help she needed however im saddened that she has turned from judaism and found solace in another faith perhaps there is something more to do
1118706 cut down on the work that has to be done when its all over
1118707 i think that dude in the corner is planning on raping you
1118708 seemed like things were fine and then all of a sudden she just said that she thought that we were different people now what does that even mean do you know because i sure as fuck dont i just miss her so much my names brian by the way
1118709 no worries ill just wait for you until your done unlike my ex girlfriend who wouldnt wait no matter how important it was to go to the bathroom and would just leave you with nothing while you were in there
1118710 i cant believe my friends left without me they were my ride
1118711 im so hiccup fucked up hiccup i gotta lay down or something
1118712 that party at bills house where that creepy guy tried to fingerbang michele while she was puking
1118713 my wildcatters have been drilling lately in the detroit formation making efficient cars is equivalent to finding an all american saudi arabia under detroit
1118714 well secondary co2 recovery makes no sense for us because oil will come in at 80 barrel
1118715 very little of the alleged underlying conduct charged in the indictment took place in the district of columbia
1118716 senator stevens is in the middle of a reelection campaign and he is required to spend much of his time in his home state of alaska
1118717 the senate is currently in recess until september and intends to adjourn again in late september for the general election senator stevens must be able to campaign albeit limitedly during the trial were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
1118718 an option that obviously would not be convenient for a washington d c jury
1118719 it makes little sense to hold this trial over 3 000 miles from the renovations the value of which is clearly in dispute that lie at the heart of this case
1118720 the obama web savviness is pretty much a bigger part of them doing everything really well
1118721 it invited people to hang their own shingle on the campaign to set up their groups set up their list serves set up their own blogs set up their own organization challenges within the overall universe of the site
1118722 you can talk all day about functionality and the background colors but to me its just some common messaging mistakes that theyre making
1118723 you go to his web site and its one big bio and thats not what people want
1118724 we think its not a coincidence that the two savviest primary campaigns with google are the winning ones
1118725 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
1118726 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1118727 we experienced a significant improvement in our credit portfolio during the quarter with net unrealized losses related to credit spreads improving by approximately 1 billion
1118728 he wanted to put it all in a building where everybody could see
1118729 frank had said a couple of times to me i really think dougs trying to kill me
1118730 that my actions contributed to his death but i loved frank craig very much
1118731 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1118732 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them
1118733 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1118734 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1118735 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1118736 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1118737 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1118738 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1118739 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1118740 it wasnt like i was looking for a day off im just doing what the coaches are telling me to do
1118741 if i was hurt id be in the training room somewhere or be out working with the trainers but i feel fine i feel good
1118742 i could have gone these days had they not given me a day off i would have been out had there like everybody else
1118743 wade has done this over the years i think it really has shown not just on the practice field but even on game day that everybodys a little bit livelier
1118744 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1118745 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1118746 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1118747 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1118748 from the tooth size and structure we can say something about the animals body weight and diet because teeth have crests that are differentially developed depending on whether they ate primarily insects leaves or fruit
1118749 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1118750 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1118751 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1118752 we are delighted to contribute to the important work that professor desimone and his students are undertaking in the field of nanomedicine this work answers key questions about the role of particle shape and size that industry leaders have been asking for some time
1118753 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1118754 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1118755 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1118756 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1118757 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1118758 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1118759 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1118760 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1118761 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology
1118762 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1118763 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1118764 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
1118765 the research also has important long term application to robotics and assistive technologies capitalising on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences
1118766 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1118767 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1118768 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1118769 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1118770 nihs unique translational environment where researchers can pursue intellectual high risk out of the box thinking with high potential payoff enabled us to pursue this work
1118771 i cant really remember my oldest brother is a drummer and he used to let me play on his kit trying to play along to my favourite bands at the time like ac dc kiss van halen etc
1118772 phil rudd from ac dc eric carr and peter criss from kiss i really only started taking it serious and putting more effort in to it when i heard pantera vinnie paul is definitely one of my biggest influences and scott travis from judas priest i guess i could go on all day with this one
1118773 primary school teachers are finding themselves compelled to teach to the test both through official guidance and through pressure to do what they can in the short term to gain higher sats scores
1118774 pupils who have taken their sats tests this year were born in the year that labour came to power yet hundreds of thousands will not have reached the basic level of literacy and numeracy and the gap between the most disadvantaged pupils and the rest continues to grow
1118775 we have received 400 e mails from heads highlighting their concerns about the results
1118776 why did you put things you already eat into the water
1118777 its not fair i have to sort it out its hard enough
1118778 the last thing i want to do is upset you mikey i just dont think its very fair
1118779 and when you win the election you win the majority and what is the power of the speaker to set the agenda the power of recognition and i am not giving the gavel away to anyone
1118780 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet i will not have this debate trivialized by their excuse for their failed policy
1118781 i love latitude its in the stars but longitude its about time time and clocks and all the rest of that have always been a fascination for me whoever makes that discovery rules
1118782 just as some democrats in both the house and the senate are beginning to heed the american peoples calls for more american energy production house speaker nancy pelosi d ca has threatened to do something quite different
1118783 this stunning admission is more than a little ironic since the speaker made repeated and empty declarations of energy independence throughout 2007 declarations like these
1118784 we hope to have legislation on global warming and energy independence through the committees by july 4th so that this year independence day is also energy independence day
1118785 we hope to have legislation that will be a starting point on global warming and energy independence through the committees by july 4th so that this year independence day is also energy independence day
1118786 house democratic leadership will be working hand in glove with the committees to unveil a package for july 4th energy independence day
1118787 we have elevated this issue by creating the select committee and we will make this july 4th energy independence day
1118788 with confidence in american ingenuity and high faith in our future we democrats declare americas independence from foreign oil
1118789 we had the results of a tasking that the leadership gave to the 11 committees of jurisdiction to the chairman to say by june so that we can announce our package for the fourth of july energy independence day for us
1118790 key positions you have embraced that we believe are essential to sustaining this movement
1118791 arroyo is a player of the highest standard and has been our top priority for a while
1118792 the one thing i love about jay after being around quarterbacks during my career he has a quiet confidence and i love that about him hes not going to do a bunch of talking about it he is not going to be jabbering to a lot of people he does his talking with his play
1118793 there is nothing promised to you so im out there just trying to get my assignments right and show the coaches i can play
1118794 you learn the speed of the game youve been around for a while so you watch the guys ahead of you and you try to mimic things that they do
1118795 this year after having a chance to watch those other guys i know whats expected of the players how youre supposed to perform here as an athlete
1118796 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1118797 were on the water right now just putting on extra lines in case it comes up
1118798 its not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area
1118799 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1118800 the bulk of them are designed to be at lunchtime so that people who work at these dmv locations can come out and join
1118801 in sum because we find on undisputed facts that cablevisions proposed rs dvr system would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works we grant summary judgment in favor of cablevision
1118802 john once again a fantastic post the contrast is evident though its too bad that not all
1118803 this is a clear violation of the 4th amendment of the u s constitution if the aclu is not already all
1118804 if anything smacks of nazi germany it is certainly this its not only appalling but
1118805 lindsay toler is the first journalist affiliated with a major news organization to blog
1118806 there is a lot of pressure on this age group from media and peers to look older act older dress older
1118807 but mentally and psychologically they are still immature compared to a 15 year old
1118808 we have kind of a vision weve talked about this of for example a child who is a student at the school for creative and performing arts living here walking through the park on their way to school we see families we see old people young people a mixed group of people
1118809 actually it is a good deal for some but most its not cause who can afford it i work at music hall i use that corner store basically every day where the people that lives down here going to go
1118810 does it work for you it could if they would include everyone in it its like theyre pushing out and pulling in and its totally unfair
1118811 i live here 24 hours a day 99 9 percent of the time this is a great neighborhood to live in
1118812 and some love it and some dont its not for everyone
1118813 oh well how much damage can this idiot do in four years
1118814 to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states
1118815 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1118816 sleep disordered breathing and mortality eighteen year follow up of the wisconsin sleep cohort
1118817 show me the top hosts using icmp at 5am this morning
1118818 i wish everybody would be treated like we treat people
1118819 and who knew her ghetto combo would almost make it to the top
1118820 vague overbroad and suppresse d the discussion of controversial viewpoints
1118821 gender motivated is on its face sufficiently broad and subjective that they
1118822 lets take the things weve learned the knowledge in creating all those great games and make our own fantasy world with some twists
1118823 days when you pull it back to what we have now with all the technology animations and mo cap it just looks that way thats the surprising outcome of just creating a game based on its principles
1118824 things those huge guides to worlds so these things are often created to fit the world together and the team builds off them how they end up in the game really varies
1118825 why dont you go make another baldurs gate game again
1118826 oh the grass is brown there must be no rain
1118827 why dont you go make another baldurs gate game again
1118828 the milwaukee public school motto is high expectations start here
1118829 i must begin with my initial positive experience with the district
1118830 over the years ive noticed a marked difference in the enthusiasm for existing in a cooperative world and the desire to demonstrate positive personal responsibility
1118831 over the years our sixth grade team suggested community mentors in school suspensions and monthly parent meetings
1118832 we all know the stories and we all have stories
1118833 i realized long ago that schools and classrooms must be conducive to learning
1118834 herein lie some questions for the council on good schools and for mps what type of behavior s should be punishable by suspension in school or otherwise
1118835 uniformity in discipline procedures and training for faculty and staff to deal with behavior issues
1118836 i think everyone is forgetting about the 73 6 per cent of kids who come to school to learn it would be nice to individualize punishment but what are these other kids supposed to be doing while the troublesome kids are getting all this attention
1118837 i think we forget about the kids who are on task and what it is we owe to them the teacher has just so much time and energy the kids who are causing problems have no right to take an education away from serious focused mps kids
1118838 if a kid doent want to be at school and follow the rules you cant teach him there needs to be an alternative place for them to go so that the teacher can teach and motivated students can learn
1118839 jds get your foot off my neck pickled green beans
1118840 cuisines of the southwest an illustrated food history with more than 160 regional recipes
1118841 two went in saturday and so there was no more rehearsals and today sunday all the rehearsals were called off
1118842 the kids are completely dehydrated two of them im sure theyre doing a lot of blood work to see if theres anything else
1118843 some of them can barely walk but theyre already television celebrities
1118844 you know you try to do every little possible thing you can but at the end of the day when you go on court and youre thinking about aggravating things youre thinking about an injury its not really the way to play
1118845 at the end of the day its tough to go on court and not be close to even 50 per cent
1118846 im too good of a player to go out there and try to fight through something that i think can eventually become something serious
1118847 het doet me pijn dat ik de spelen en de us open moet missen dit zal het eerste grandslamtoernooi zijn waarop ik niet in actie kan komen
1118848 het was niet fijn om te horen dat mijn medische team dit al die tijd niet opgemerkt heeft
1118849 we are obviously disappointed that maria will not be playing in dubai as we know that she enjoys playing here and is extremely popular with the crowds however we understand her need to rest as a result of this illness and wish her a speedy recovery
1118850 maria im so excited about this trip its one of my priorities for this year along with competing in the olympics ever since ive been watching the olympics on tv and ever since i went to moscow to watch the girls play in the final watch them win hear the anthem it was really amazing i mean in todays match we had a group of about 20 russian fans you know yelling my name and elenas name and saying no matter what happens russia is still the champions im looking forward to it even though were playing in israel im looking forward to the team experience and also visiting israel for the first time
1118851 voc tem que me obedecer porque eu sou sua m e
1118852 the goal was to prevent them from being asked any questions that could reveal information before nasa is ready to make an announcement
1118853 determine the ph the abundance of minerals such as magnesium and sodium cations or chloride bromide and sulfate anions as well as the conductivity and redox potential
1118854 the first contains an acid to tease out carbonates and other constituents that are better dissolved in an acidic solution the other three crucibles contain a reagent to test for sulfate
1118855 if there are water born chemicals like carbonates or sulfates they may have been created by the very ice that phoenix is sitting on when that ice melted at some point in the last few hundred thousand years
1118856 if there are grains of these salts and theyre very sharp edged that means they would be young
1118857 if they were blown around for millions of years they would be rounded just like river rocks are rounded over time
1118858 if theres a lot of water involved water that liquefies once in a while that may be enough to destroy any oxidants
1118859 it might be the chemical environment of the high latitudes that may preserve the fossil signatures of life better than the equator
1118860 if you can be the first to do it youre going to own it
1118861 you have to decide to stay on it or you can get behind
1118862 greg lippert sees a perfect storm brewing around the nations dining sector a confluence of uncontrollable factors starting with high energy prices and extending from surging cheese and flour costs to rising labor costs
1118863 we are now competing with international prices this is a challenge facing the whole restaurant industry typically restaurant sales have a direct relationship to consumer confidence discretionary income whole segments of our population are struggling with price driven needs
1118864 now generate average sales of 1 25 million per eatery more than double wher e unit sales stood when lippert joined the firm in 1984
1118865 greg developed a love of soccer as well as golf which led him to depauw university a small liberal arts school in greencastle ind while playing on the universitys ncaa varsity soccer team he targeted a career in advertising working at restaurants and other places to pay his way through school he also fell in love with speech pathology major elizabeth loupee
1118866 one of the largest home builders in the u s kb home has announced that from 2009 all its new homes will meet energy star certification criteria
1118867 we are committed to making sustainability an integral part of how we do business
1118868 the company already offers buyers some energy efficiency technologies such as tankless water heaters but cost remains an issue with solar panels too expensive to make it onto the list of options
1118869 our business requires a delicate balance between the societal need for affordably priced new homes and the environmental need to use our limited natural resources wisely
1118870 in the last three years 330 000 homes have been built in the us that include some kind of green technology this figure represents 6 2 of the total which while still small is a big increase on the 1 8 in 2005
1118871 to each and every one of you my best wishes

1118875 depauw will rise and fall on the strength of its intellectual life period
1118876 the stronger the education is for the students the stronger the school is
1118877 the plan is for me to listen and hear what is going on and then working with them to develop a plan where depauw is going in the future
1118878 not that im without ideas but its very important to me to have contact with everyone here if they want
1118879 its amazing its our job to teach them how to think and to write because i cant predict no one can predict the world they will be living in 35 years from now we want to produce ethical conscious engaged lively civic people
1118880 the town and the university have been intermeshed with each other since 1830 they have been connected very deeply for a very long time there have been some periods where there wasnt a very productive relationship i need greencastle to be vibrant and alive and interesting and i think we can realize it all together
1118881 start a conversation among concerned christians about this vital issue
1118882 ive always quoted let us not love with word or with tongue but in deed and truth
1118883 their love for each other has deeply moved everyone at the lakehoma church
1118884 it has raised the bar on how to obey the command to serve one another in love
1118885 i mean im from massachusetts this is about as far as you can get me out of my comfort zone
1118886 just the fact that we moved here when we did and everything just happened with rachel and i just happened to be the same blood type
1118887 theres no way that you cant see gods hand in it
1118888 i was ready to help with the kids so that they could get the transplant done
1118889 every time i heard theyre not a match it was like ok but thats one step closer that im not going to get that chance to live and watch my girls grow up
1118890 nobody will think less of you if you dont do this
1118891 and that is the only way to look at it
1118892 i was like yes im just so happy this is working out like it was supposed to
1118893 in cablevisions view a network dvr is in essence simply a dvr with a very long cord
1118894 cable operators would no longer need to provide a unique piece of hardware for each individual subscriber in order to offer dvr functionality
1118895 dvrs have been one of the largest single drivers of capital spending in recent years accounting for as much as 10 of capital spending for the major cable companies further cable gains a huge differentiator versus their satellite competitors under the ruling cable operators will not only be able to offer dvr functionality to all digital subscribers whether they have a dvr or not but also to every tv outlet in the house that has a digital set top box
1118896 with a stroke of a pen the appeals court has opened the door to a massive increase in the penetration of dvr capabilities core among these is ad skipping
1118897 the satellite operators will be forced to operate at a significant technological and economic disadvantage
1118898 time after time when confronted with conflicts of interest merrill lynch was consistent in that it placed its own interests ahead of its investor clients
1118899 the gloves are off and we are not concerned about issuer perception of merrill lynchs abilities and the competition gotta move these microwave ovens
1118900 the fact that were lower seems to speak volumes about how falling demand has moved into the top place in this market
1118901 the market remains bearish both fundamentally and from speculative traders exiting positions
1118902 support is at about every 20 with initial support at last weeks low of 120 40 roughly and then between 102 and 98

1118905 the aim of creating the company is quite clear as grain trade becomes attractive bureaucrats are looking for ways of making some extra money using government resources
1118906 the idea is to manage the assets more efficiently and to generate profit
1118907 russia has this black soil its another resource just like oil and gas
1118908 the land plus new technologies should make russia a world leader again in grain production and exports just like it was at the beginning of last century

1118915 one thing they can bring is a little more passion if they can be flying around with their hair on fire then well really have something
1118916 if they see her genuinely fighting for senator obama out there campaigning and asking her supporters to come on board saying its imperative we elect him i think that will go a long long way
1118917 i feel a lot of democratic women feel this election was stolen
1118918 our perception is that there is some resentment by women against the democratic party and maybe along with resentment comes the realization that the politics of the democrats arent good enough for women
1118919 as republicans i think we have a tremendous opportunity to reach across the aisle
1118920 three quarters of the country at this point does not know that john mccain is pro life
1118921 and i think once the democrats make that known as surely they will these people will come scampering back to the democratic party in droves
1118922 too much is at stake for me to say he really wasnt my candidate
1118923 the womens vote is an absolute must for the democrats to win senator mccain is going to have to cut into that
1118924 its a business phone and you should be happy theres even a camera on there
1118925 this is the story of our grandmothers and great grandmothers as they lived only 90 years ago it was not until 1920 that women were granted the right to go to the polls and vote in presidential elections
1118926 hey on a percentage basis or on a relative basis were seeing improvement of x
1118927 we are definitely going to try to address that problem and close that loophole
1118928 i thought that was a good article in sundays paper
1118929 it was not one that i enjoyed reading because we need to do everything we can to keep this from happening but it was a useful article in the sense that if its going down we definitely need to close that loophole thats allowed that to happen
1118930 ive already contacted several individuals today about the language to move forward to close this loophole
1118931 my suggestion of what well do and i intend to talk to our city council about it is that we create by ordinance a provision that when an agricultural property is cleared of trees and then sold to a developer then that becomes a taxable event so that you have to pay the mitigation damages because its no longer being used for agricultural land
1118932 i would anticipate it would be challenged because its a pretty sweet deal now
1118933 i doubt when the legislature was trying to protect agricultural land i doubt if they envisioned that ranchers will clear all the trees and sell it to a developer that probably was not envisioned i think there will be legislators who will be willing to close that loophole
1118934 e71s keypad is one of the best qwerty keypads weve ever laid fingers on
1118935 with the nokia n95 8gb you have tilt to the side or open the slider and then have to put it back to portrait mode to login or search websites

1118948 the failure of the plutonium fuel experiment is another major setback for the mox program and will further increase the already considerable cost overruns delays and risks
1118949 congress needs to pull the plug before even more taxpayer money is wasted
1118950 to go forward with mox now areva would have to redesign the mox fuel and duke would have to repeat the entire experiment delaying the testing program by at least eight years doe should instead dispose of the plutonium directly by mixing it with radioactive waste and encasing it in glass which would be safer and cheaper than continuing the mox program
1118951 its probably the quietest one ive seen in 20 years
1118952 to come from having worked a block one fiesta where i had seven stabbings in half an hour to this is pretty great
1118953 there was a good family feeling downtown which we dont always get with fiesta
1118954 there were little groups that showed up but once they showed up we were on them
1118955 its a completely different scene than a few years ago
1118956 we didnt have a lot of out of town gang members either which used to be the trend
1118957 it was viva la communidad this year and we had a great community atmosphere
1118958 we dont want the government shutdown to be an issue but the fact is the democrats are so overconfident that theyre willing to talk about a ban and theyre willing to talk about raising taxes on gasoline so this is just pretty incredible

1118981 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1118982 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1118983 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1118984 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1118994 we do have some troops probably in anbar province and maybe some places in baghdad who could be redeployed

1119006 g lens financial resources were detailed in the public prosecutors arguments which claimed that saudi arabia iran the turkish government and the central intelligence agency or cia were behind the g len movement it stated that some businessmen in ankara donated 10 to 70 percent of their annual income to the movement and that it corresponded to 20 000 to 300 000 per year per person it added that one businessman in istanbul donated 4 5 million each year and that young people graduating from g lens schools donated between 2 000 and 5 000 each year

1119140 do not let the book of the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful
1119141 if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for it is with your heart you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved
1119142 the god whom you have mocked will deliver you into my hands
1119143 fear you no longer will be my master i have a new lord in my life and he has not given me a spirit of fear but of power love and self control
1119144 if you just have a tiny bit of faith god can use your little faith to accomplish significant things

1119147 i prayed for a miracle i asked in jesus name i spoke to the mountains god did not answer prayer in 24 hours so i decided those promises are bogus
1119148 god if it is your will please remove this mountain
1119149 the church is looking for better methods god is looking for better men this vital urgent truth is one that this age of machinery is apt to forget the forgetting of it is as detrimental to the word of god as removing the sun from its sphere darkness confusion and death would ensue what the church needs is not better machinery not new organizations or more novel methods she needs men whom the holy spirit can use men of prayer men mighty in prayer the holy spirit does not come on machinery but on men he does not anoint plans but men men of prayer
1119150 lets be realistic the middle east has been a place or turmoil for thousands of years do you really think a genie covered in seaweed on the coast of scotland can grant that wish make another wish

1119152 he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things
1119153 well see what happens but to remain is his first choice there are other possibilities to analyse but hes very happy here
1119154 in the coming days if something comes in well need to evaluate it and come to a decision but david wants to stay and he has a contract
1119155 there were many clubs interested in him so he wants to feel valued at valencia as is normal but he wants to stay
1119156 daniel is a special talent and i am delighted that we have been able to add him to our ever improving squad its an incredibly exciting signing for the club and a real coup
1119157 hes one of the stars of madrids academy and he is the link man weve been looking for hes comfortable on the ball has great technique and is deadly from set pieces
1119158 the season is only just beginning and i have proposals from other clubs such as chelsea

1119163 ive been impressed with him i like him very much and im pleased weve got him here
1119164 hes a good kid and has the potential to become a very good player
1119165 he was recommended to me and we got him here straight away because there is a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids
1119166 arsenal are unique their coach hasnt won anything for years but hes an idol
1119167 when we faced the preliminary round with chievo we were penalised by the fact it was the first big european match for us and we threw away a great chance
1119168 for that reason this time we cant underestimate neither our opponent nor the importance of the match and we have to go on the pitch aware that we cant make mistakes in any case i think they will be two very difficult matches even though we could have had a tougher opponent
1119169 we are not yet at our best but we are growing
1119170 the first match in a competition like this is always very important and considering that we are in a tough group its important to start well
1119171 being able to breathe this magical atmosphere and experience the feelings only the olympics can give you our national team is full of talents a team which can do very well if everyone plays to their potential we have a lot of enthusiasm which is important to face this challenge
1119172 i want to stay and prove i can cut it in the premier league

1119217 unmarried women are the largest bloc of non voters in the country yet last night they made up a greater share of the electorate than their overall measure of the entire state population
1119218 the high turnout of unmarried women making their voices heard in iowa suggests that unmarried women across the country will make their presence felt at the polls to vote demanding attention of the candidates
1119219 90 of unmarried women agreed they must speak up and make their presence felt in the national conversation if they are not satisfied with the direction our country is headed in
1119220 our most recent research tells us that unmarried women are proud that theyre making it on their own and feel its time for the decision makers in washington to acknowledge their societal contributions and respect their realities of every day life
1119221 in the last presidential election over 150 000 unmarried women in iowa were absent from the voting booth on election day those women were part of the 20 million unmarried women in the country whose voices were silent in 2004
1119222 the 28 of iowan women on their own who caucused is the first example of the critical role unmarried women will play in the national discussion and demanding the attention of the presidential candidates

1119228 this is the time first that a lessee has contractually undertaken to pursue environmental enhancements that it may implement on its own initiative or that may be required by the corporation
1119229 with the recent completion of berth 10 the ports seventh dedicated container terminal the ports other terminal operator patrick will vacate terminal 7 enabling dp world to take it over
1119230 this will give dp world a total lease area of 35 8ha to be operated as a container only terminal for an initial term of 20 years with a 20 year option
1119231 this will expand both port operators leased area providing them with 900 metres of quayline each to enable them to continue to maintain a three berth operation in the face of ever increasing ship size
1119232 under the existing leases the corporation owns the improvements in the form of pavements lighting buildings etc dp world has expressed a strong desire to own its improvements under the new lease as significant additional development is required by dp world to refurbish and re engineer the terminal
1119233 dp world brisbane has experienced sustained growth and were delighted to have secured a 40 year lease well ahead of the expiry of the current lease in 2012 to facilitate our further growth into the future
1119234 dp world is looking at investing around a 250 million at fisherman islands over time to expand and to re engineer the terminal in response to market demand
1119235 we are pleased the new lease specifically recognises the importance of environmental and sustainability enhancements in terminal operations and we congratulate the port of brisbane corporation on this initiative
1119236 dp world takes its responsibility to the environment very seriously and we are working hard as an organisation to minimise our impact on the environment globally
1119237 the port of brisbane has experienced significant growth in recent years reflecting its role as a trade gateway between australia and key asian markets including china and india
1119238 dp worlds investment and long term commitment to the port of brisbane will give our customers access to a truly world class facility in queensland

1119397 my mother and lolo would remain cordial through the birth of my sister maya
1119398 the newspaper quoted zulfan adi who described himself as one of obamas closest childhood friends

1119409 in his prepared statement obama told the sun times that michelle fell in love with the house
1119410 the boston globe also reported real estate agent schwans recollection that the obamas may not have made the highest bid but that the willingness of the obamas and rita rezko to close in june was decisive
1119411 the couple who sold barack obama his chicago home said the illinois senators 1 65 million bid was the best offer and they didnt cut their asking price because a campaign donor bought their adjacent land according to e mails between obamas presidential campaign and the seller

1119425 obama will undoubtedly campaign in the general election saying he wants to maintain a strong military just as he will say he is fully committed to the survival of israel obamas problem is that neither position may be credible in the face of video clips that show him saying he wants to reduce the military cut nuclear weapons and pull out of iraq

1119428 contract that creates an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
1119429 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
1119430 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
1119431 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
1119432 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
1119433 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests

1119499 with the us economy in a downward spiral and many states facing huge budget deficits mercks action last week will help many state adaps be able to continue to provide lifesaving aids drugs particularly more expensive second line treatments to poorer people in need through the us while we laud merk for this action we will continue to press both government agencies and private industry for lower drug pricing to increase access to antiretroviral treatment both in the us and globally

1119504 no es muy inteligente pero tiene una maravillosa aptitud para la m sica
1119505 estoy siendo un tanto provocativo intencionalmente si hubiera dicho que hab an siete clases de competencia la gente hubiera bostezado y dicho si si pero llam ndolas inteligencias estoy diciendo que nos hemos inclinado a colocar un pedestal una variedad llamada inteligencia y que en realidad hay una pluralidad de stas y algunas cosas en las que nunca hemos pensado como inteligencia de manera alguna

1119516 sammy was an exciting player to watch from our side he came up as a 5 tool player and there wasnt anything he couldnt do he played extremely hard all the time much like utley plays now and was fun to watch sammy always gave it everything he had and from that standpoint it made him an excellent teammate in fact he was my sons favorite player when i was there
1119517 everyone in the town dies and there is no hope for anyone

1119523 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1119524 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1119525 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1119526 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
1119527 however we see a lot of association between asthma and acid reflux in the 15 million americans who have asthma as many as 50 to 80 percent also have acid reflux
1119528 we do know that reflux can cause asthma if the reflux is aspirated into the lungs or the acid in the esophagus can cause chest tightness also if acid gets into the bottom of the esophagus it can reflux up against the bronchial nerve which causes the airways to narrow and a shortness of breath
1119529 my patients will say oh that tightness in the middle of my chest isnt there anymore
1119530 when a patient thinks of reflux they think of heartburn or regurgitation and they arent aware of the other atypical signs
1119531 its not uncommon anymore to get referrals from allergists and pulmonologists
1119532 sometimes surgery is needed to tighten up the esophageal sphincter which prevents the reflux of acid
1119533 this is the first experimental evidence in a controlled laboratory setting linking these two very common conditions in humans
1119534 these data suggest that chronic micro aspiration of gastric fluid can drive the immune system toward an asthmatic response
1119535 this does not mean that everyone with gerd is going to develop asthma by any means
1119536 but it may mean that people with gerd may be more likely to develop asthma if there is an upside to this it is that developing gerd is something we can pretty much treat and control
1119537 although it may be possible for a new u s administration to repudiate the disastrous bush policy
1119538 a tremendous amount of damage will already have been done
1119539 a lot of people are into this john mayer but im not sure i get it
1119540 one of the burglars came into the room i was in
1119541 nothing was going through my mind except please dont look and find me
1119542 he didnt even realize i was standing there he was smashing me up against the wall
1119543 he had been trying to climb over the fence and both his feet had been impaled
1119544 during the course of the evening he had managed to free one foot
1119545 he had been hanging on the fence for nearly 12 hours
1119546 no one was kind enough to offer him a light
1119547 he is beating him with the butt of a sawed off shotgun
1119548 you have something on your mind and nothing is going to stop you from attempting to get what you want
1119549 delinquencies among prime loans which account for most of the 12 trillion market doubled to 2 7 percent
1119550 by and large we have the ability to judge the feds the ecbs and the bank of englands intervention as a success from a liquidity standpoint and bnp paribas continued function is proof of that
1119551 the fed and the ecb used existing tools and when needed devised new tools such as the term auction facility to keep markets functioning the pervasive fear that gripped the markets last year is gone still theres no denying the economic impact of the housing recession it will take about 0 5 0 7 off the eus gdp and about 1 0 1 2 off the u k s gdp in 2008
1119552 you may find a 300 000 or 350 000 bargain in california or florida but comprehend that five years down the road that home might be roughly the same price in real terms after inflation
1119553 job creation in an area will determine which way home prices are going in a region in the years ahead much more than how bad the local housing market is now
1119554 in general lower home prices and the big inventory of homes give the advantage to the buyer but they also increase the buyers equity risk and thats something you dont hear realtors speak too much about
1119555 prices are lower now but keep in mind prices are likely to fall even more in most regions of the country so if you buy now but have to sell in two or three years due to a relocation you might end up losing a great deal of money i would not purchase a home now unless i completely needed the space for example for a growing family
1119556 while its true the best home on the block generally starts with the highest value it isnt true that the ideal home is more protected against price declines
1119557 the ideal house could end up losing more value in percentage and absolute terms than the median home on the block because its price contained a larger bubble a bigger artificially high price due to the wealth effect of the recent housing boom
1119558 a big question for whole foods is whether even its core customers will continue to pay prices like 6 99 a pound for all natural air chilled chicken breast or 12 for a bag of cherries
1119559 i know some of the events of the weekend have been a big buzz for good reason
1119560 jeffrey henson was also suspended indefinitely for his actions im going to let the dust settle just a little bit to make sure i know just exactly what the truth is before i make a final judgment on him
1119561 as far as the situation with the hospital we know former player michael lemon was arrested for underage possession and we also know there was some damage done to the hospital
1119562 the other thing he has to do is once the damage is totally assessed and there is a price tag on it he will have to repay that
1119563 the first two saturdays that we are playing football he will be working a job those days too to help earn money to pay for the damage
1119564 we also know that it doesnt matter where you start as much as where you finish but the coaches poll is a poll that is part of the decision making process to see who plays in the big game down the road and there is a long road before we get to that point
1119565 its nice to have a third of that group think highly of your program as you begin because as we all know people usually get knocked around throughout the season and a lot of times where you start helps you finish a little bit closer to the top if in fact we do fall somewhere along the way
1119566 im looking forward to getting out there this afternoon and watching these young freshmen were looking forward to seeing what they can do the overall chemistry is being built right now
1119567 its embarrassing i actually could have started practice a couple of days earlier than i did we would have had to practice and take sunday off then start again with the second day of acclimation on monday i said we can have one less practice opportunity and that would be fine it would give our coaches another day or another weekend with their families it was a little bit more of a break and it turned out to be a bad situation as far as giving them another weekend of freedom its embarrassing its said im going to get over it pretty quick because i have to i told the assistants this morning i am counting on them to coach and teach football because that is the phase we are in now and that is what we have to concentrate on ill continue to sort out all these other things as we need to but i think we are just about finished dealing with that kind of thing right now
1119568 we are going to bring in another longsnapper ty frix bo fowler is our longsnapper right now he actually snapped in the bowl game because jeff henson was not able to participate in the bowl game because of his first incident bo did a very nice job he has worked hard and we have a lot of confidence in bo before jeffrey got into his issues bo was beginning to snap our extra points and field goals and jeff was doing just the punting in the spring we didnt name a starter as snapper we were competing between those two guys it wasnt like jeff was guaranteed to be the snapper anyway although he was certainly in the running
1119569 say what you want but we are still in the business of educating young people to learn how to live life and get their degree and move forward that is my focus and that is my job thats what im doing in a very organized and meticulous way weve had more issues that what i would like to deal with in any give off season im not so stubborn that im not going to be open to other ideas we will be open to ways of making sure we do a better job we have multiple sessions on the things that need to be done and the things that dont need to be done we bring in all kind of folks to talk about the things that we need to do when a guy steps out of line he does get disciplined if a guy gets where he will not comply then he goes because its not a right its a privilege to be at georgia
1119570 usually we wait until after the first scrimmage to start moving the depth chart there are times you can move it and i allow each coach to have his own style of how he wants to handle it some coaches right after the first practice might say im moving him ahead of you some coaches wait until the first scrimmage grade it then reset the depth chart at that point every once in a while a guy deserves to be promoted before a scrimmage and sometimes a guy deserves to be demoted before a scrimmage
1119571 since ive been here at georgia this is probably the most amount of guys who are game ready hopefully a couple of more guys will add to that a couple of young guys
1119572 im very interested to see our kickers kick and to watch blair walsh andrew jensen and everyone who is going to be taking a swing at it im very interested to see our young players i think every coach loves that first day of practice when the freshmen come in who you worked so hard to recruit and convince to come to your school they have these high hopes and dreams and we have the same thing for them its one thing to see them move around in shorts and helmets but it will be interesting to see how they handle the contact and the grind of camp
1119573 i thought the defense played well last year i cant say every single game they played great i dont know if anyones defense every plays their a game every single game but for the most part they played outstanding we know in the tennessee game we didnt play that great defensively or offensively for that matter even in our loss to south carolina the defense played well that day we played oklahoma state who is a very talented team with an explosive offense the same as hawaii and some other teams and weve done a pretty good job of containing those people coach martinez has them playing hard and smart and getting after it i thought the biggest key to our team last year was playing a lot of guys we have a lot of guys coming back who have played a good bit and hopefully we can continue that trend
1119574 he has a ton of potential and a ton of talent if he learns this offense i think he maybe could be a part of our offense this season with his ability to jump and run routes and his quickness he just has a ton of talent ive been really impressed with him
1119575 weve been hearing about the possibility about being preseason no 1 throughout the entire off season it may have given some of the guys a little bit more of a drive but i think for the most part our team works as hard as they can each and every off season
1119576 every time you turn the t v on were somewhere out there we know we have high expectations for this year but at the same time we know we cant achieve any of our goals if we dont come out and start from day one and practice and work hard
1119577 youre going to see guys that are out there playing hard working hard and making plays weve worked as hard as we possibly could this off season just to make sure that whenever our number is called that we can help the team its a very competitive group but at the same time its a brotherhood the older guys are leading the younger guys the younger guys are brining the energy that the older guys are feeding off of and everyone is just getting better off of it
1119578 its huge for me to know massaquoi is going to be there its big for our other receivers they are getting to learn from him kenneth harris also in taking those guys under their wing and trying to get them ready to play as soon as possible
1119579 thats one of the many things we realize that preseason rankings really mean nothing we started last year like no 15 or 16 in some polls or whatever we were and we ended up no 2 so you never know where youre going to end up and we know that as crazy of a season as it was last year it could be just the same this year or it could be back to normal with an undefeated team you just dont know we realize its going to take a lot of hard work and preparation to get this thing going in the right direction
1119580 not as far as anything on the field with the stuff that we can take care of and worry about there isnt any advantage or disadvantage about any ranking as far as the bcs the polls how people vote or how far you fall thats stuff we cant control the stuff that we can control is on the field when you get out on the field there are no rankings its just team vs team
1119581 i think it will be tough each and every week will be down to the wire we definitely have to prepare for that and that is what we are doing right now camp just started so we are getting prepared for that first game were just going to focus on one game at a time
1119582 im not going to approach it any different im going to do the same things i did last year just try and get better each and every week and work on the small things to get us better as a team i think it will be fun but at the same time im working hard still
1119583 weve got a lot of guys back so we feel really good about our defense we have guys who understand this defense and guys who have gotten a lot of reps weve got guys who are very comfortable in our system
1119584 it is expected that we play we great defense our job is to hold teams to the lowest amount of points as possible coach willie martinez and the other coaches prepare us well
1119585 the offenses we play every week will present a challenge to our defense so we have to do a great job of preparing each week
1119586 all we can control is playing georgia football for us to be successful we have to do the things we need to do to win games
1119587 our defense has to be tough we have to be unified we have to play as one we need to go out there like a bunch of wild dogs and get after it this defense has a lot of talent and experience and that goes a long way
1119588 experience is big the more experience you have the better off youre going to be but with this team guys are going to competing every day young and old alike everybodys trying to win a starting job you cant take a day off you cant take off a play in practice you cant take off a rep in the weight room youve got to bring it every day
1119589 even though its hot its going to be exciting finally getting back into football i think we all are really looking forward to it we have worked hard in the offseason and now its time to play football
1119590 its exciting to look at the roster and the depth chart and see so many guys back on defense we have so many guys who have been through the storms and who know what to expect
1119591 youre on vacation now you can take care of him for a little while

1119625 that philosophy should not be living together with theology under the same roof if they mistress and maid inhabited the same house the maid might become ambitious desiring to be mistress herself
1119626 if in the interpretation of the bible one made use of philosophy scripture would be easily held in contempt
1119627 van tils notions on gods existence thus seem to have been inspired by descartes as for example the notion that the idea of a highest being necessarily implies its existence that the idea of god within man as an absolute and perfect being can only be derived from our creator that the idea of god is placed in man by god
1119628 doubt was not to be identified with regarding a thing as untrue but should be interpreted as suspension of judgement until we see reasons to embrace the truth indeed according to allinga and other cocceians there was no better means of destroying atheism than methodical doubt

1119719 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
1119720 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
1119721 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
1119722 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you

1119727 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year
1119728 but this workout is mandatory and all players must attend its coach rods call on that this is his first year at u m and hes doing everything he can to make sure his team is successful
1119729 i fully expect we will continue production beyond this season and i can stand by that
1119730 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
1119731 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
1119732 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
1119733 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
1119734 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
1119735 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
1119736 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
1119737 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
1119738 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
1119739 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
1119740 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
1119741 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract
1119742 we are now focused on doing well in the third test match
1119743 both murali and mendis are very good and accurate bowlers and there is no doubt we found it tough to handle them in the first test match in colombo
1119744 but after playing them in the second test we are much more confident we are now able to read mendis from his hand and off the pitch up as well so there is no problem and there is no worry
1119745 our process for the test series is in place and everyone in the team has been given a role to perform everyone knows what role he has to play in the team and how he is going to execute the strategy
1119746 we knew that our team was capable of doing it they are after all professional cricketers and they know how to make best use of their resources
1119747 the new date has been set after fresh hope appeared of reaching an agreement
1119748 a massive fireball from space hits new yorks central park and an ordinary man emerges unscathed the man turns out to be a spaceship operated by 100 human looking aliens who are one quarter inch tall and seeking a way to save their planet complications ensue when their captain falls in love with an earth woman elizabeth banks whos always picked losers for previous romances
1119749 im going to be effin forty this year how the fnck did this happen to me
1119750 gee what a gutless unimaginative doltish immature little boy of a 16 year old i was
1119751 having read the post at your second link gary i now know how utterly dull comparitively my life was at 16 to yours
1119752 the terroists have laptops in their hideouts can america afford to have a leader who is just learning to use one
1119753 posting rules prohibit correctly spelling out curse words so that people who have work filters for profanity can still read the site
1119754 me i pointed it out to people a whole lot of times
1119755 so that people who have work filters for profanity can still read the site
1119756 so a single instance of profanity in a comment wouldnt trigger a blacklisting but frequent usage might
1119757 ive always felt that it really helped to raise the level of discourse here and its yet another thing that sets obwi apart at any rate
1119758 i do have a cause though it is obscenity pause im for it
1119759 you dash dashed aig suckin sheep stealin one eyed son of a stuffed monkey
1119760 if twain could get around the comstockery of his day with a bit of creativity so can we
1119761 if a rule keeps getting broken it shouldnt be a rule
1119762 i think youd be particularly interested to know that in the us birth control pills are abortifacients
1119763 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions
1119764 freecreditreport com ceo announces he cant remember how company was supposed to make money
1119765 theres an undertone of something sadness resignation an understanding of the tragic in sinatra that none of peers really have
1119766 a quarter to three and its just me and you so set em up joe i got a little story
1119767 the clinton era economy and the esteemed position of america in the world seem almost fairy tale like in comparison to our present predicament making gore look even better for the nostalgic
1119768 i never watch tv news ever i see enough of it from clips on line and glimpses in airports to know theres nothing there
1119769 i know it is a philosophical difference but i tend to believe that competence and competition are closely related
1119770 given that 40 votes are all that you need to effectively block the senate im inclined to think that one party still controls both congress and the executive branch if obama wins you might just get your wish for divided government since i think it is unlikely that the democrats will get to 60 in the senate
1119771 ive taken to looking at this election as a referendum on the american people
1119772 im shocked shocked that john mccain lives up to his nasty nickname
1119773 hey when mccain talks trash about me hes really talkign trash about all of my supporters and voters
1119774 when i speak in front of 200 000 expatriate americans and foreigners abroad i dont see what mccain sees apparently he just sees me one lone black guy up there
1119775 keep obama front and center hone his message on the george bush economy on gas prices on the bush economy on the credit crunch on job losses on the wall street got drunk economy and name a vp candidate hello sen biden to handle all of the incoming fire and bullshit from mcshame and his band of bullies
1119776 youre not stupid enough to fall for that crap are you
1119777 obama should not have responded to mccains paris hilton reference it drew attention to himself and made him look petty
1119778 cleek keep me posted on the emails youre in for a finders fee
1119779 but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this elections about is that what is worthy of the american people
1119780 personally im just sitting here watching the world go round and round
1119781 catsy yep i mean he can appeal if he wants or i can be overruled by my co bloggers and so my personal judgment is not the final word but my personal judgment is that was final
1119782 one game some learn during these times is finding personality tweeks among others and if deemed appropriate to learn to pick at these tweeks
1119783 i cant believe im saying this to gary but click through and read the links
1119784 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula
1119785 you know the movie where batman finally grows up and finally stops being the teenager angry at the world and starts figuring out how to be an adult
1119786 one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention
1119787 i have a lot of complexes and paranoia issues when it comes to blogging primarily that netrootsy bloggers want me to go off in a corner and die
1119788 for some reason i could see charlize theron pulling it off
1119789 primarily that netrootsy bloggers want me to go off in a corner and die
1119790 but this is based on adom and in adom the puppy cave is one of the two safest starting targets
1119791 i could spend several paragraphs now justifying why i think its premature to pass any judgment on whether the surge will go down in history as even a partial success
1119792 knowing that and saying that didnt stop boot from telling the same radio audience that mccain has been vindicated in iraq yes we dont know what iraq will look like in six months but we do know that whatever lurks out there on the horizon will vindicate mccain well nonsense
1119793 the people of iraq the government of iraq and the people of the united states want us out so lets get out
1119794 where are these naderites what blogs are they posting on who are they supporting for president
1119795 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
1119796 caution ing against the assumption that people dont exist if theyre not posting on blogs
1119797 the ends justify the means the ends justify the means the ends justify the means
1119798 were going to vote for the guy so quit hectoring us for something we friends of ours did eight years ago
1119799 we pledge to work actively for the democratic candidate s without uttering a peep of protest about corporate and imperial policies
1119800 introducing a resolution recognizing the strategic success that the surge has achieved in a central front the central front of the war on terror against the enemies who attacked america on 9 11 01 and expressing our thanks to our troops whove made that success possible
1119801 this is one of those cases where i sincerely hope that i was right and that nader will either not run
1119802 not one single person was killed in ethno sectarian conflict in may or june of this year
1119803 president davis its february 1865 and combat deaths have gone down significantly since the battle of nashville the war is over
1119804 am i losing my mind or is totten can someone tell me how no one lost their life in the recent spate of suicide bombings
1119805 and i dont know that one can win an occupation
1119806 its up to the iraqis to decide if the war is won or lost and that includes the opinions of the millions of exiles and the opinions of the relatives of the hundreds of thousands of dead
1119807 and i dont know that one can win an occupation
1119808 man of the people the maverick life and career of john mccain
1119809 it is entirely likely that someone would have attacked us for having gone and it is entirely likely and it has come about that people have attacked us for not going
1119810 thats completely untrue and i think honestly they know its untrue
1119811 man of the people the maverick life and career of john mccain
1119812 claiming victimhood and blaming they is how obama has earned his living to date
1119813 my gut tells me that he is afraid to look soldiers in the eye
1119814 obama presents himself to photographers while wearing a united states marine corps tee shirt you are not supposed to do that
1119815 he was not a marine i dont think he understands that
1119816 if you do not understand this femdem i will not be able to explain it to you
1119817 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1119818 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1119819 to heck with the t why didnt he just go visit the troops
1119820 thats a bit of a nasty distortion of what obama actually said
1119821 to heck with the t why didnt he just go visit the troops
1119822 its those nasty people around him not straight talk john
1119823 ted stevens to be indicted on seven counts of making false statements to federal investigators
1119824 approximately 30 percent of teenage girls in the united states become pregnant and 20 percent give birth by age 20 increasingly policy makers and advocacy groups are recognizing that the high rate of unintended pregnancy among unmarried women in their twenties is also a major social issue half of all pregnancies in the united states are reported by the mother as being unintended more than one third of these 1 1 million pregnancies in 2001 are to unmarried women in their twenties the national campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy estimates that these pregnancies accounted for nearly half of the 1 3 million abortions in 2001
1119825 providing abortion through medicaid would also tend to reduce unplanned pregnancies and ensure that women who needed an abortion didnt end up having a late abortion because first of all she had to save the money to pay for it
1119826 so for example i can support contraception without supporting for government paid abortions
1119827 it always amazes me when you weigh in on this stuff sebastian shouldnt you as a gay man defer to the people who actually have to deal with the situation
1119828 either abortion is constitutional and legal medical procedure or it isnt if it is and it is what are the grounds for medicaid not paying for it
1119829 either abortion is constitutional and legal medical procedure or it isnt
1119830 providing abortion through medicaid would also tend to reduce unplanned pregnancies and ensure that women who needed an abortion didnt end up having a late abortion because first of all she had to save the money to pay for it
1119831 well if 100 hours is good then why not 1 000 or 10 000
1119832 who was that dude a few weeks ago who was complaining about obamas proposed college grants in exchange for national service who kept saying
1119833 if medicaid funded abortions are good why not forced tubal ligations or locking girls away in harems
1119834 im content to leave the decisions to be made by qualified doctors as to whether its medically advisable for the health and well being of the patient myself i dont care to get into attempting to delegate my personal preferences as to what other peoples medical treatment should be
1119835 its okay for me to abort if i need to
1119836 well why dont we just cut off peoples penises huh huh
1119837 why dont we just lock all girls away in harems
1119838 i actually found the book by reading about it in the penn gazette the title was so funny that i immediately bought a copy and read it the book was hysterical craig boreths writing has such a genuine and fresh voice even though the book was written from a guys perspective both men and women can appreciate the humor of finding yourself on the verge parenthood and then all of the comedy of being a parent i am in the early stages of development on it i am exploring both paths of setting it up in television and features working on a comedy will be a much different experience than my last project i produced which was a crime thriller called tortured starring laurence fishburne and cole hauser sony recently bought it and will be releasing it in september
1119839 how to iron your own damn shirt the perfect husband handbook featuring over 50 foolproof ways to win woo amp wow your wife
1119840 depende mucho del segmento del mercado que se mira en el segmento medio alto la gente quiere todo confort prestaciones seguridad y est dispuesta a pagar por eso pero cuando se baja en la oferta y se mira en el segmento de autos chicos las limitaciones presupuestarias obligan a optar y la gente termina eligiendo por el auto que se puede comprar y no por el que quisiera comprar en ese mecanismo de elecci n la gente todav a le da prioridad a los aspectos que tienen que ver con el confort porque los elementos de seguridad resultan muy onerosos para ese segmento
1119841 todays dowd op ed is a classic example of her worst impulse to think that shes speaking for the common man by assuming that the common man is 100 douchebag
1119842 guess what i just thought of hillary is so butch that she makes obama look even faggier than he already is
1119843 it contains no information no insight no humor and is to quote bull durham self indulgent overrated crap
1119844 typical tax cutting republican people die as bridges go down
1119845 typical tax cutting republican people die as bridges go down
1119846 but more importantly obama understands too well at a personal level how difficult empowered women are to manage
1119847 obama understands too well at a personal level how difficult empowered women are to manage
1119848 another good day of imitating a third world banana republic monica
1119849 co opted into a new paradigm you dont want to be part of
1119850 approach es gun violence as a public health issue advocating that firearms be subject to health and safety standards like those that apply to virtually all other consumer productst sic
1119851 to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
1119852 im all for people living their lives as they see fit if someone broke into my house and took money for an abortion it would be considered theft if the state does it it is
1119853 if you could please point out the specific amendment to the constitution grating this right i would be very appreciative
1119854 i want to do what i want and the hell with the consequences to you
1119855 beware that when fighting monsters you yourself do not become a monster
1119856 if walking outside to have a cigarette is just too much to bear you need to learn to deal
1119857 would you be okay with allowing bars to improve the atmospherics by using fog generators that emit low level toxins
1119858 you could sell me on an exemption for private clubs and for places like cigar bars where people go specifically to smoke
1119859 you cant smoke in your car because someday someone else might have to drive it
1119860 i have no problem with abortion being available i simply disagree that people have a
1119861 i think abortion is wrong i recognize that is based completely on a belief with no scientific basis and i dont believe that my beliefs should be foisted on anyone else however i do oppose having the state support this
1119862 there is nothing preventing womens groups from setting up abortion funds for poor women who cannot afford them
1119863 as for the conservative movement a guise to benefit a small subset of rich elite why do so many rural areas not known for their flagrant wealthiness vote republican
1119864 the insistance that health care in the us has got to be profitable to private business is the main reason why americans pay more than any other nation for their health care and have a worse health care system than any other country in the developed world and worse even than some third world countries
1119865 according to the gathering of eagles web site iran is at war with us i find that far from reasonable
1119866 the state also forbids you from shooting up heroin in bars and it greatly limits the availability of many prescription substances
1119867 so where in that exhaustive list of government powers is funding healthcare in any way shape or form
1119868 we the people of the united states in order to promote the general welfare do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america promote the general welfare
1119869 the congress shall have power to provide for the general welfare of the united states
1119870 how about if they posted a notice outside that said whites only
1119871 those people who want to suck down carcinogens can do so despite smoking bans all they have to do is get a patch
1119872 given that the addicts can get their fix at comparable or lower cost using a patch
1119873 im thrilled that smoking doesnt hurt you it hurts me it hurts my friends
1119874 smokers who are not addicted to nicotine should be able to survive for a few hours without smoking
1119875 but to the extent that people are addicted to nicotine their body needs nicotine itself nicotine addicts cant get by smoking nicotine free cigarettes so im skeptical that smoking rather than nicotine delivery is the key feature of their addiction
1119876 if i go to a bar my skin and clothes will smell funny
1119877 the bars were permitted exactly that before the passage of smoking bans and the market didnt provide those nonsmoking bars you cant give your business to bars that dont exist
1119878 in all the municipalities im familiar with no such consensus has arisen regarding the negative consequences of viewing naked people there are concerns about secondary effects of strip clubs and as such these organizations are regulated but there are a lot more bars than strip clubs if the moral majority can build a political consensus banning strip clubs or porn then they should go do that i dont think they can but please let them prove me wrong i would love to see politicians talking about eliminating porn that would be teh awsum also teh quixotic
1119879 that part of the conservative movement with no actual power to affect government or business policies
1119880 the idea is that those who dont want to be exposed to smoke should simply never go to a bar or a music show or whatever other sort of place the market decides shouldnt be smoke free
1119881 if smoking in and of itself were pleasurable even without the nicotine id expect that wed see lots of people smoking nicotine free cigarettes just to gain that pleasure
1119882 and the market had plenty of chance to solve the problem but it failed
1119883 so to my eye the principled conservative seems to remain a mythical beast
1119884 im thrilled that smoking doesnt hurt you it hurts me it hurts my friends
1119885 do you really think a fair reading of my comment rips my words completely out of the context of smoking in bars
1119886 i also think public sex acts should be restricted at most public establishments do you agree with me on the last one
1119887 im all about insisting that people not pee anywhere and everywhere
1119888 thats why i think that libertarians ought to support most smoking bans your right to smoke is outweighed by my right to breathe
1119889 is there a cottage industry of left leaning moles worming themselves into the nra or heritage or any other conservative outfit whether for hire or just for the hell of it
1119890 no ones talking about how to keep the other side home on election day
1119891 its a lot easier than you think and it doesnt cost that much this election can be won by 200 000 votes
1119892 for example you can go on all the pro life chat rooms and say youre an outraged right wing voter and that you know that george bush drove an ex girlfriend to an abortion clinic and paid for her to get an abortion
1119893 then you go to an anti immigration web site chat room and ask whats all this about george bush proposing amnesty for illegal aliens
1119894 im asking because i suspect that liberals and conservatives are different kind of people for whatever reason it seems like the dirty tricks types always seem to pop up under the conservative banner
1119895 to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
1119896 im thrilled that smoking doesnt hurt you it hurts me it hurts my friends
1119897 do you really think a fair reading of my comment rips my words completely out of the context of smoking in bars
1119898 im happy to stipulate that someone smoking very far away from me doesnt trouble me in the slightest
1119899 i wrote that sentence with no other text and no other context
1119900 greatly increases the odds of my getting sick and possibly dying
1119901 do you really think a fair reading of my comment rips my words completely out of the context of smoking in bars
1119902 im thrilled that smoking doesnt hurt you it hurts me it hurts my friends
1119903 i suspect that there is a bigger coorespondence between authoritarian personality types and self identified conservatives than there is between authoritiarian persnality types and liberals however it would be hard to proove in large part because it is impossible to define who the conservatives are
1119904 you see senator even kevin martin was concerned enough that he did x
1119905 actually the internet is successful because the government regulated the bejesus out of it
1119906 bell used metered pricing to cross subsidize various services and crowd out competition e g by pricing local service low and long distance high because no one else wanted to build a long distance network when bell already had one
1119907 who knew that this freak would be the one to let me down the most
1119908 one of the premier academic institutions for studying comics animation and other forms of visual rhetoric in north america
1119909 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate degrading images
1119910 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton
1119911 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1119912 tommy asks me to marry him every day its very confusing marriage is romantic and i get swept up easy
1119913 tommy is the love of my life its a very deep love that grows in all sorts of unexpected ways its been the one relationship thats challenged me to the core
1119914 between dealing with heath onscreen and with everyone around her she couldnt take it so she left
1119915 dear madam ive lost a small fortune to this contraption so im the wrong person to ask so i must now take my leave
1119916 get off your ass black people its time to get out and vote
1119917 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
1119918 they were together by the pool all day saturday they were very affectionate he made sure he was always touching her
1119919 pamela was somebody who was more familiar to them in terms of what was on tv at the time they were looking for someone bustier taller leggier than me they couldnt fathom how david and me could equal success
1119920 tim lent a lot to what i describe as sort of the psychedelic aspect of this album kind of a pink floyd or dark side of the moon or almost like a queen night at the opera type of a feel
1119921 thats something i never would have predicted you know i would have felt like i would be the one that would try to go into the album oriented rock world and really it was tims influence on this album that pushed it more in that direction
1119922 he is what he is and i have the right to say what i say about him
1119923 it is very hard for a man to defend anything of which he is entirely convinced it is comparatively easy when he is only partially convinced he is partially convinced because he has found this or that proof of the thing and he can expound it but a man is not really convinced of a philosophic theory when he finds that something proves it he is only really convinced when he finds that everything proves it
1119924 shall i tell you where the men are who believe most in themselves for i can tell you i know of men who believe in themselves more colossally than napoleon or caesar i know where flames the fixed star of certainty and success i can guide you to the thrones of the super men the men who really believe in themselves are all in lunatic asylums
1119925 no one who believes in him will be put to shame
1119926 everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved
1119927 how beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good news
1119928 their voice has gone forth to all the earth and their words to the ends of the world
1119929 i will make you jealous of those who are not a nation with a senseless nation i will make you angry
1119930 i was found by those who were not seeking me i revealed myself to those who were not asking for me
1119931 mans response to god by faith must be free and therefore nobody is to be forced to embrace the faith against his will the act of faith is of its very nature a free act
1119932 god calls men to serve him in spirit and in truth consequently they are bound to him in conscience but not coerced this fact received its fullest manifestation in christ jesus
1119933 for he bore witness to the truth but refused to use force to impose it on those who spoke against it his kingdom grows by the love with which christ lifted up on the cross draws men to himself
1119934 wage the good warfare holding faith and a good conscience by rejecting conscience certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith
1119935 love cannot triumph unless it becomes the one passion of our life without such a passion we may produce isolated acts of love but our life is not really won over or consecrated to an ideal until we have a passionate love for our lord in the most blessed sacrament we shall accomplish nothing
1119936 behold we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified and he will be raised on the third day
1119937 command that these two sons of mine sit one at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom
1119938 you do not know what you are asking can you drink the chalice that i am going to drink
1119939 my chalice you will indeed drink but to sit at my right and at my left this is not mine to give but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my father
1119940 you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and the great ones make their authority over them felt but it shall not be so among you rather whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave just so the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
1119941 they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified
1119942 have you no fear of god for you are subject to the same condemnation and indeed we have been condemned justly for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes but this man has done nothing criminal
1119943 amen i say to you today you will be with me in paradise
