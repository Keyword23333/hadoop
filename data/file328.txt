3280008 we honor the principle that a current spouse has no obligation to support someone elses child while accounting for the reality that the current spouse may provide economic resources to the household
3280009 new jersey does not give same sex couples like jim mcgreevey and mark odonnell the freedom to marry and to be legally equal spouses

3280018 i know heaven will not be the same with you there as you chase the angels and fly around the place or perhaps the angels will be chasing you instead
3280019 he loved to party this heaven is one endless party
3280020 as humans we have the gift of free will and to make choices both good and bad and in this case a bad choice was made by an individual with tragic consequences
3280021 his presence was unique he always managed to light up the room
3280022 its a good kind of stress its a great problem to have
3280023 its a responsibility to do the most and the best good we possibly can
3280024 its comforting to think we will have this endowment to support us as we look to the future
3280025 its totally up to them what they want to do
3280026 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
3280027 you have to win eight gold medals to get noticed he wins a gold medal and everyone says one down seven to go people have no idea how hard it is to get up on the blocks and swim out of his mind like that
3280028 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3280029 we gave our best effort if we came up short hes not going to be looked at as a guy who was on a relay that lost or that he came up short nah hes an amazing athlete probably the best ever in this sport regardless of what happens here hes going to go down as that
3280030 i jumped in the air and almost fell in the pool
3280031 i was thinking if there was anybody on this team or in the world who could do it it would be jason who could pull this off i was pounding on the blocks saying aaaaah come on we looked up at the board and it was phenomenal i dont think anybody in the world could have done a better job without a doubt
3280032 we were the favorites in both of those years this year we were actually considered the underdogs in past olympics it just wasnt attainable theres no way i was going to catch a guy whos two seconds ahead of me
3280033 when i flipped at 50 meters and saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder until about two minutes before that the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then i changed i said you know what this is ridiculous its the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going to go out in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got supercharged and just took it from there it was unreal
3280034 he got his hand on the wall and i got chills seeing their reactions and how happy they were
3280035 the problem is one that is quite serious across the state
3280036 were out of free fall but were not in an era when social capital has gone up

3280039 it is clear that it is possible to provide patients with excellent
3280040 but our report also shows that there are issues of significant concern
3280041 there are cases where people are not always getting the personalised
3280042 i think that society is sometimes reluctant to talk about mental health
3280043 with the support of trust boards commissioners and the government we can get all services up to this benchmark and provide the high standard of care that patients deserve

3280049 die um ihr nationalratsmandat bangende jvp chefin sylvia fuhrmann setzt im wahlkampf offensichtlich voll auf pflanz statt auf substanz

3280051 grunds tzlich ist jede verbesserung der pflegegeldeinstufung f r kinder und jugendliche erwachsene mit intellektueller behinderung sowie f r demenziell erkrankte personen zu begr en die derzeitige regelung ist jedoch ungen gend und bedarf noch in einigen punkten dringend einer nachbesserung
3280052 es ist nicht nachvollziehbar dass nur die m ngel bei der beurteilung von schwer mehrfach behinderten kindern und jugendlichen beseitigt werden sollen
3280053 dass die pflegegeldstufen 1 und 2 sogar noch darunter bleiben ist ein besonderer skandal
3280054 nachbesserungen sind unabdingbar auf die neue regierung kommen daher einige hausaufgaben zu die aus den m ngeln der vorliegenden regelung resultieren
3280055 weiblich nichtraucher aus dem engsten umfeld angeschnallt gelassen und aufmerksam
3280056 man kennt einander und ist vertraut das gibt beiden ein gef hl der sicherheit
3280057 fast alle der befragten sch tzen es wenn sie auf verkehrskontrollen und gefahrenquellen hingewiesen werden
3280058 wer wei wo s langgeht steht in der beliebtheitsskala ganz oben
3280059 so st rend die kritik am fahrstil ist so unterst tzend sind lobende worte vom mitfahrer
3280060 es st rt daher keineswegs dem fahrer f r eine besonders sichere und angenehme fahrweise hin und wieder ein lob auszusprechen
3280061 es vielen unangenehm ist den beifahrer an das angurten erinnern zu m ssen auch f rchten viele fahrer im falle eines unfalls zur verantwortung gezogen zu werden
3280062 sogar viele raucher erachten die zigarette im auto als v llig berfl ssig
3280063 der fahrer wehrt sich instinktiv gegen die vorw rfe und der fahrstil wird eher verfestigt als ver ndert
3280064 rger und streit haben im fahrzeug nichts verloren da sie den fahrer stark vom eigentlichen verkehrsgeschehen ablenken
3280065 der lenker sollte seinem beifahrer sagen was ihm bei einer sicheren und konzentrierten fahrweise hilft und unterst tzt und der beifahrer sollte dies zur eigenen sicherheit auch beherzigen
3280066 generell f hrt die anwesenheit von mitfahrern zu einer senkung des unfallrisikos das gilt aber nicht f r alle beifahrerkonstellationen und nur unter bestimmten umst nden
3280067 sie m ssen sich als lenker ihrer f hrungsrolle st rker bewusst werden aber auch als mitfahrer k nnen sie einiges dazu beizutragen dass alle sicher nach hause kommen das gilt vor allem f r fahrgemeinschaften wenn am wochenende ein disko oder partybesuch angesagt ist
3280068 durch gruppendynamische prozesse kann es zu einer aufteilung des verantwortungsgef hls auf alle fahrzeuginsassen kommen
3280069 direkte oder indirekte aufforderungen der gleichaltrigen mitfahrer k nnen dazu f hren dass schneller und riskanter gefahren wird unter dem druck der gruppe kann eine sicherheitsorientierte fahrweise stark ins wanken geraten
3280070 mitfahrer d rfen den fahrer nicht unter druck oder stress setzen sondern sollten in ihrem eigenen interesse den fahrer bei seiner fahraufgabe unterst tzen und r cksicht nehmen

3280086 youd probably be the same way if terrorists descended on our house and took over at first youd be like what are we going to do theyre going to kill us we have to get them out of our house now the next minute id hear you out in the kitchen saying you boys must be so tired from all the terror you are causing what with the planning and then having to carry it out why it must be so draining here let me clean your guns for you
3280087 then youd come back in here and say to me i dont know what we are going to do we have to get these men out of our house five minutes later youd be back in the kitchen telling them not to worry that you would run up to the store and get more ammo for them and i just love that shade of green on you it shows your skin off so well youd say
3280088 i might be able to get some good recipes from them you know

3280091 i think its an obscenity i cannot imagine that people in that situation who did what they did to their own daughter are attempting to profit from it
3280092 despite their the parents egregious denial of her danieals existence in life they now seek to profit by her tragic death that they caused
3280093 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment
3280094 the beneficiaries could be these kids danieals siblings and that could be a positive outcome

3280115 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months
3280116 it reinforces the view that the economy will be weak in the next several months and there will be renewed pressure on the fed to start easing again
3280117 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3280118 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken
3280119 when times are tough the herd starts running in the other direction with tougher standards pretty much across the board
3280120 large majorities of domestic respondents reported having tightened their lending standards on prime nontraditional and subprime residential mortgages over the previous three months
3280121 very large majorities of domestic and foreign respondents pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook their banks reduced tolerance for risk and the worsening of industry specific problems as reasons for tightening their lending standards
3280122 about 60 percent of domestic banks a slightly larger fraction than in the april survey reported having tightened lending standards on commercial and industrial loans to large and middle market firms over the past three months

3280193 verve wireless has raised 3 million in its second round of fundraising led by its biggest customer the associated press iron capital and crosscut ventures also participated in the round
3280194 mobile is actually a better way to reach people than print or even web its versatile immediate travels and is just as compelling if its done right as a web site or a printed page
3280195 there is still no better way for the local florist or bakery to reach potential customers than the daily newspaper kenney argues and mobile makes that even easier
3280196 a mexican restaurant can send a reader a coupon for a free margarita when they are walking nearby during happy hour for example or a car dealer could deliver an ad with a map and walking directions when a user types in an auto related search

3280199 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3280200 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3280201 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3280202 let it be a u n mandated international force ideally eu
3280203 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3280204 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3280205 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3280206 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3280207 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
3280208 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters
3280209 we have people here from all religions and cultural backgrounds some of whom may feel uncomfortable or offended with condoms in their room
3280210 no one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment
3280211 people are encouraged to take the leaflets and to take as many as they like they can use them or take them home for friends and spread the knowledge and awareness

3280213 the absolutely nice part aside from the non smoking area that will be created is we have a great amount of fresh air coming into the building even in the smoking area
3280214 we have a lot of people commenting that they cant wait to play in that room and they hope put the games in there they like
3280215 the team works extremely hard to keep things clean and orderly

3280219 whats really nice is the casino is amenity to the resort itself
3280220 when you come to this resort you have a variety of things to do golf bowling entertainment horseback riding
3280221 we regularly have people who visit who knew the resort from the past
3280222 and its a true pete dye course ive been told its an extremely difficult course
3280223 my practice is concerned with exploring the fascination that the british public has with american popular culture and the sub cultural world of fandom
3280224 boom boom bindras fired up a nations imagination and given indian sport a desperately needed shot in the arm
3280225 bindras steely resolve and ability to chart his own course wiped out more than a century of ignominy
3280226 indias first individual gold at the olympics may just end india incs obsession with cricket and bring in the moolah money for other sports in the country
3280227 watching the six events we were doing each time the chinese athletes performed phenomenally
3280228 we actually had eight camps and we tried to increase our difficulty at each of them
3280229 when the vault was over i was wondering how things were going
3280230 but then my athletes performed very well on parallel bars and horizontal bars
3280231 i feel a little regretful and depressed but our whole team tried their best even if we didnt win the gold medal i think silver is good enough
3280232 we knew before we needed a perfect day to get a medal but the united states had kind of a perfect day and earned a medal
3280233 its difficult to explain but the timing was not right
3280234 i tried to correct myself during the turn and i missed that that happened
3280235 by the end of the games we will have been here for five weeks
3280236 its a mistake to think that the games are easy because it is sports
3280237 none of us are experts on sports rules so we must prepare ourselves
3280238 im disgusted and annoyed that a spanish cyclist has been the first athlete to be found positive of doping at the olympic games
3280239 im very angry that it is cycling that is in the headlines of the worlds media despite all of the crackdowns we have been doing
3280240 any statements coming out of the spanish federation dealing with doping i would treat with a certain amount of skepticism
3280241 because the spanish federation have constantly defended athletes who have been involved in doping cases they have been light in the way theyve treated doping cases how many spanish athletes have been caught in spain i dont think anybody has been charged under that law
3280242 puerto has been badly handled by the authorities from the outset they keep hiding behind the spanish judicial system
3280243 there doesnt seem to be a real will to go after the athletes involved it shows that there is a cultural problem in spain if so many cyclists are ready to take doping products
3280244 im aware of parents of junior cyclists who have purchased doping products for their sons its a shocking thing to say
3280245 the spanish cycling federation tests junior racers and eight out of 10 of the guys they have tested are approaching the limit and these are juniors
3280246 im disgusted and annoyed that a spanish cyclist has been the first athlete to be found positive of doping at the olympic games
3280247 im very angry that it is cycling that is in the headlines of the worlds media despite all of the crackdowns we have been doing

3280253 the spanish cycling federation tests junior racers and eight out of 10 of the guys they have tested are approaching the limit and these are juniors
3280254 they have all been telling me what a huge achievement winning gold is
3280255 i realise that but frankly the enormity of the goodwill generated has caught me by surprise
3280256 honestly enough it really has not changed me i am still the same abhinav who just a day ago was hanging around alone in my room in the olympic village
3280257 during the asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi
3280258 that didnt provide us an opportunity to check the security arrangements so there was no way we can formulate an opinion on rawalpindi
3280259 we are trying to explore whether if we use only lahore and karachi
3280260 the attitude and willingness of the pakistan government officials to implement security measures was very positive
3280261 its not proper for me to single out any one person in the meeting
3280262 we all share the same concerns we have to ensure the safety of the players the media and the concerns were all common
3280263 we won the champions trophy which was great but that is not as big as this olympics
3280264 this is my last olympics we can make it we have to think positive
3280265 in argentina i said to everyone maybe playing u s and gb is more difficult than better ones teams we tend to take it easy
3280266 for me it will be hurt if we dont get one of the three medals
3280267 gold is better of course because we have been training everyday for the gold medal we have a good team but we have to play better than we played today
3280268 i just wanted to win that race win the heat
3280269 i wanted to set everything up for tomorrow get through that and just prepare myself for tomorrow
3280270 i have to go back and do all that stuff to set myself up for the perfect swim
3280271 its not what its all about im trying to get in there and get good races and do the best i can i feel like less pressure because i already have two medals

3280280 if it was a great show i hope we have more great shows throughout the week
3280281 i was just thinking to myself this is the last lift girl you do this
3280282 i get really nervous before a competition but i tell you watching her i could barely sit still
3280283 it was a different feeling being in the stands but she did incredible and were all so proud of her its the best competition shes had since i cant even remember when
3280284 im disappointed with how i did the last lift was an american record lift thats probably the biggest disappointment because ive done it in the gym

3280293 my goal is hey feed off the energy if they dont want me to succeed man im going to exactly do the opposite
3280294 bob plays better when people are going against him so im looking forward to the match
3280295 if we go out and happen to win tomorrow its going to be like usa basketball vs
3280296 i came here with very open expectations you can lose to anybody at the olympics
3280297 i came here with very open expectations you can lose to anybody at the olympics
3280298 i think i need to show them that i can run the offense consistently and make plays what they are looking for is a leader someone to take charge
3280299 osaar is trying to come to terms with a new offense
3280300 the one he executed last year was tailor made for him now its a new deal
3280301 he has a tendency to want to get out of there
3280302 i have to show them that i know what im doing out there and show them i can be a leader and run this team thats what theyre looking for someone who knows the playbook inside and out and can show the other guys to help them and have them trust you
3280303 chris i think has to grasp the whole package more
3280304 i think he can execute plays i dont think he knows how it all fits together
3280305 a little baby goes to talk or wants to eat they rush because their brain is going before they can think things through
3280306 i have to come out here and be consistent with the checks and consistent with the throws every day until sept 1 i have to keep progressing and try not to take steps back
3280307 im just trying to stay in the thick of it and work on my stuff and not worry so much about competing with corp its more just getting everything down its not going to be much of a competition if i dont know what im doing
3280308 its a little bit frustrating for him right now because some of the stuff is making the same mistakes more than once and weve got to get over that hurdle
3280309 hes probably about par for the course of where he should be
3280310 i feel like im in a decent spot right now its just a matter of staying consistent getting first team reps is a big confidence booster and when you succeed in there and make some plays that also helps

3280312 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
3280313 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters

3280315 as the day of the long awaited opening ceremony arrives chinas economy is indeed slowing
3280316 new orders at factories have declined and the countrys property market has seen a sharp drop in transaction volumes
3280317 chinas manufacturing sector is facing tough challenges due to the slowdown in the global economy rising production costs tight credit conditions power shortages and currency appreciation
3280318 if growth goes lower than 8 the government will be very worried
3280319 the inflow of hot money has had some negative impact on the economy it is hoped that the regulation can enhance monitoring and control some speculative investment and foreign capital inflows
3280320 the slowdown will be less severe than olympics pessimists predict
3280321 the right conditions may be in place for a strengthening of investor sentiment
3280322 nosotros tenemos que pensar primero en serbia y despu s en los cuartos de final porque queremos ser primeros del grupo y respetamos a todos los rivales
3280323 eso por un lado continu el t cnico pero tambi n sabemos que estamos clasificados y ser a muy perjudicial para el equipo perder en la instancia siguiente a riquelme y ag ero por eso preferimos darles descanso el mi rcoles por ma ana y despu s contar con ellos una vez que pasemos los cuartos de final pensaremos en las semifinales
3280324 por un lado el gobierno de morales obtuvo m s votos lo que significa que una voluntad mayor de la gente apoya su proyecto y por otro lado hubo un apoyo a los prefectos que fueron ratificados todo indica que habr que conciliar las propuestas creo que se viene la articulaci n entre la nueva constituci n y los estatutos auton micos
3280325 la verdad es que estoy un poco mejor de mis molestias no sent nada y por suerte el partido fue corto
3280326 fue importante que el partido no se hubiera prolongado mucho porque me da m s tiempo para recuperarme y estar mejor para lo que se viene
3280327 el calor y la humedad desgastan el f sico de cualquiera adem s la pelota con el correr de los puntos pasa a estar m s pesada m s fofa y no toma bien los efectos por lo tanto hay que acostumbrarse a eso
3280328 si la autonom a es para el pueblo ser garantizada
3280329 cuesta todav a hacerles entender que autonom a no es independencia ni separaci n de alguna regi n si la autonom a es para el pueblo ser garantizada
3280330 es inviable una cosa es lo que el presidente dice y otra lo que hace
3280331 no es suficiente la expresi n jubilosa de los ganadores en el referendo revocatorio es indispensable que en poco tiempo se planteen reglas claras de c mo llegar a ese di logo
3280332 ha llegado la hora de la reconciliaci n bajaremos de una vez el tono bolivia quiere paz y certidumbre la gente quiere a los prefectos y tambi n al presidente ahora est diciendo p nganse de acuerdo es lo que hay que hacer
3280333 quiero invitarlo a que se sume a esta autonom a a que comprenda que bolivia quiere recorrer un camino alternativo democr tico donde la gente participe
3280334 no es problema de evo de si voy a ceder se trata de buscar consenso con todos porque el acuerdo depende del pueblo no de evo hay que escuchar a los prefectos pero tambi n hay escuchar a los movimientos sociales
3280335 si tienen un mensaje radical depongan su actitud y trabajemos juntos
3280336 fidel dec a no hagan lo que yo he hecho hagan lo que est haciendo hugo ch vez una asamblea constituyente y por lo tanto una revoluci n en democracia con el voto del pueblo y yo entend perfectamente ese mensaje
3280337 los prefectos con su proyecto auton mico y el gobierno con la nueva constituci n tenemos que construir ese pacto de unidad nacional
3280338 no hay que tenerle miedo a compatibilizar la nueva constituci n y los estatutos el tema lgido para los c vicos es el de autonom as pero creo que la autonom a departamental y la ind gena pueden ser complementarias igualmente los autonomistas no van a querer compatibilizar porque quieren toda la torta e imponer sus estatutos de facto los ind genas vamos a exigir participar del di logo
3280339 antes de compatibilizar los textos se deber a llegar a un pacto social para iniciar otro proceso constituyente
3280340 no tiene pisada pr cticamente tiene que venir con el ej rcito
3280341 sigo siendo el prefecto de cochabamba quiero ver c mo el presidente en un retroceso de la democracia pone a dedo un prefecto que tiene que ser electo por el pueblo
3280342 era dif cil ganar porque aqu prima lo pol tico antes que la gesti n pero me siento contento porque aument m s de 100 mil votos en relaci n a lo que obtuve en 2005

3280344 emocionalmente la derrota frente a lituania fue un golpe duro fue un tropez n pero las chances son firmes ahora quiz tenemos un poco m s de presi n pero nada que este equipo no se pueda bancar
3280345 el grupo est intacto como siempre heridos un poco tristes por c mo se perdi pero tambi n estamos con ganas de revertirlo

3280347 aquellos obst culos que no tienen que ver con las particularidades propias del alumno ni lo estrictamente acad mico
3280348 una recurrencia de problemas vinculados con la falla en el reconocimiento de la cultura universitaria

3280356 es un recurso m s para evitar la deserci n para ayudar a los estudiantes nuevos a sortear las dificultades de la cursada
3280357 de qu nos sirve sacar aumentos salariales de 25 por ciento si despu s la inflaci n va a estar por encima de esos valores es una responsabilidad neta del gobierno que tendr que tomar las medidas eficientes para frenar esta espiral inflacionaria
3280358 estamos trabajando y les propongo que lo hagamos juntos en encontrar f rmulas de financiamiento que hagan sustentables tanto un aumento en las asignaciones familiares como la merma del impuesto a la ganancias
3280359 no se transforme el debate en una tribuna pol tica
3280360 hablamos sobre el eje de la ley que apunta a eliminar que la movilidad jubilatoria sea fijada por el ejecutivo y lo haga el congreso a trav s de un sistema permanente y estable
3280361 establecimos la agenda de las reuniones y con un consenso amplio tambi n trabajamos sobre la lista de invitados acordamos que cada bloque har una pregunta al ministro tomada y que luego se har una nueva ronda de consultas
3280362 vamos a estar a la vista de todos que los diputados se luzcan con su trabajo parlamentario y no por discursos pol ticos para eso habr tiempo el a o que viene que es un a o electoral
3280363 el fusil no se encontraba apoyado en la v ctima sino a una distancia no menor de 25 cent metros
3280364 el largo del brazo no permite el disparo sin contacto con el cuerpo
3280365 la imposibilidad de que se hubiera apoyado el fusil en el cuerpo previo al disparo surge de la inexistencia de p lvora en sus ropas y de quemaduras y tatuajes caracter sticos de disparos de menos distancia
3280366 en mi opini n la v ctima estaba de rodilla o sentada cuando le dispararon
3280367 la investigaci n no se orient hac a ninguna persona pese a que surge que el disparo fue hecho por un tercero en la misma resoluci n de la jueza subrogante alicia borch s que ordena que sea archivada la causa se reconoce que hubo errores en la investigaci n

3280369 parece que todas las muertes de soldados en el ej rcito han sido suicidios
3280370 si es necesario acudir n a la corte interamericana de justicia para esclarecer el hecho
3280371 fue raro que haya intervenido un juez provincial ya que al tratarse del ej rcito debi actuar una jurisdicci n federal
3280372 encontrando resistencia por parte del magistrado quien rechaza con escasos argumentos la petici n y provoca que la causa deba ser resuelta por la corte suprema de la naci n la que falla a favor de la competencia federal
3280373 no se resisti al arresto pero la detenci n le result una sorpresa
3280374 el viernes es mi l mite y los n meros se los presentaremos a los gremios en paritarias
3280375 fue alta en las escuelas estatales y baja en las privadas
3280376 as llegar a al 50 por ciento anual ni lo pensamos
3280377 una propuesta sensata que supere la m s pesimista y opositora de las creencias sobre inflaci n anual que hay circulando
3280378 con preocupaci n con angustia que muchas escuelas no hayan recibido directamente a los alumnos
3280379 ser muy cuidadoso a lo que es el marco institucional que se prev para este tipo de situaciones cuando hay diferencias que son las paritarias

3280385 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3280386 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3280387 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3280388 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3280389 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy
3280390 de ahora en m s las utilidades ya no se podr n deducir como un gasto

3280392 do you ever feel like your parents were better at this than you are
3280393 this horse has always had problems with his feet but the condition that he arrived back in after his time in quarantine at eastern creek was very disturbing
3280394 when i have total control over him he is ok but with him being at eastern creek for four weeks his feet have really got away from us and he is quiet sore at the moment
3280395 because he is such an athlete he will not take long to come to hand as he doesnt carry any excess weight but i would want to be able to get a saddle on him in the next fortnight or our railway stakes plans would be up in the air
3280396 we still have the option to drop back to the sprint races like the winterbottom stakes and the colonel reeves
3280397 if we totally run out of time the australia stakes at moonee valley next year could become our major short term goal
3280398 he would never have started in singapore once we drew wide but if we had of scratched the expenses for the trip would not have been funded
3280399 he still ran well and the form of that race has been since been franked
3280400 in total he would have been in isolation for around 12 weeks which is ridiculous
3280401 we spent four weeks in melbourne on the way across four weeks in singapore and then four weeks back at eastern creek
3280402 until these quarantine laws are relaxed i will not be travelling any of my horses internationally again i can understand the frustration of international trainers who want to come to australia from all over the world
3280403 impressive link was shin sore when he debuted but his trial was good and friartruck usually sprints well and his track work has been first class
3280404 the restoring force trf has received the preliminary letter of intent from the ministry informing trf that it has been granted a license to start a community radio station in gurgaon considering trfs existing work in government schools in gurgaon especially in the area of career counselling and infrastructure development it seems appropriate to focus at first on this area alone
3280405 my intention is to blog the entire community radio project so that one the entire process is documented and two so that any one out there who has an opinion or input can do so via this blog unlike a commercial project this project is completely transparent so there is no hesitation in sharing ideas and progress and failures and successes if this is a project that you have something to say about you must write in

3280414 escuchamos declaraciones que dec an que las tropas rusas que hab an entrado a abjasia hace un par de meses estaban ah en una misi n humanitaria ahora sabemos que la verdad es que esas fuerzas estaban para reconstruir las v as f rreas para permitir el abastecimiento de municiones y otros abastecimientos militares para ayudar a la invasi n rusa
3280415 hay una clara responsabilidad por parte del gobierno ruso para ponerle fin r pidamente al conflicto
3280416 jika merencanakan perjalanan ke wilayah itu tunda dulu apapun keperluannya sampai situasinya stabil
3280417 koridor busway akan dialihkan pada saat upacara penaikan bendera di pagi hari dan saat upacara penurunan bendera di sore hari

3280419 jika buku buku ini diterbitkan di yordania dan mesir yang bersahabat dengan israel saya akan segera membelinya ke sana yang menjadi masalah adalah pembaca buku bahasa arab di israel tak bisa menikmati karya sastra terbaik tersebut
3280420 benar benar perubahan teknis benar benar minyak dan dolar euro itu merupakan gabungan semuanya anda dapat melihat kepanikan di sini di pasar emas saat ini
3280421 jangan terkejut melihat itu masih terus turun ke sisi short jika kita terus menyaksikan penguatan dolar dan melemahnya minyak mentah itu belum penjualan yang berlebihan tanpa rusia saya pikir kita bakal turun pada level 700 dolar
3280422 untuk bermain posisi short saya akan tetap menjaga order hentikan kerugian pada sekitar 870 dolar as per ons jika kami melanggar di atas itu saya akan perkirakan saluran turun dipecahkan
3280423 ada banyak kelemahan dan banyak orang menjual dengan cara ini dan membongkar posisi long
3280424 setiap orang sedang mencoba untuk keluar dari pintu dan itu mennerobos 850 dolar saya duga mereka tidak ingin berada dalam emas saat ini
3280425 anda dapat melihat 750 dolar anda dapat melihat 900 dolar lagi anda tidak dapat mengesampingkan apa pun lagi khususnya jika ada eskalasi militer di iran atau sesuatu yang sama terjadi dan kita dapat kembali naik
3280426 kekompakan dengan ibra masih banyak yang harus kami lakukan memang tapi saya suka bertandem dengan dia dan membuka ruang dengan pergerakan pergerakan tertentu
3280427 musim lalu kami hanya sedikit bermain bareng tahun ini mudah mudahan kami bisa berbuat lebih banyak lagi untuk membantu tim ini memenangi sesuatu yang penting
3280428 hal yang bagus mengenai tevez adalah ia bermain dengan hati dia tak bisa terintimidasi ia bertarung untuk mendapatkan bola dan ia sangat membantu kami

3280645 tighter credit conditions in terms of both collateral requirements and generally wider lending margins is impairing housing market activity
3280646 in terms of the outlook the july survey lends further support to the notion that activity may be beginning to stabilise albeit at a low level
3280647 it has been an encouraging month for sales 25 up on june and just 20 down on july 2007
3280648 conditions are more difficult even than the 1990s because of a lack of first time buyers entering the market due to a lack of available mortgage funding
3280649 the only properties attracting any interest are those offered at greatly discounted prices ie repossessions new builds on large developments and the older rural properties the first time buyer is on the list of endangered species
3280650 with no let up in the housing market slowdown and the squeeze on incomes forward orders pointed to further slowdown
3280651 with shoppers increasingly cautious in spending tight budgets and now often seeing clothes as more of a discretionary purchase core basics childrenswear and clearance bargains sold well
3280652 even heavy discounting often failed to tempt customers to buy
3280653 i can put the great tradition in one word privilege
3280654 the puyos meant to convey a warm friendly impression and bring together clean safe and fun functionality in an environmentally responsible people friendly minimalist design featuring an ultra high efficiency small frame and fuel cell technology

3280656 its a fairly weighty item in a sock and had been under the seat of his vehicle for two months after he was assaulted
3280657 he kept it in the footwell below his drivers seat for protection
3280658 you will be aware of the ongoing national debate on offensive weapons including knives
3280659 but all too often this court has to consider other improvised weapons like this
3280660 its obviously something that is capable of inflicting a nasty injury but its not in the same category as a knife or an axe so im not going to consider custody
3280661 so far so good so far so good so far so good

3280670 the robots themselves will not be super intelligent and will not be motivated to take over themselves but those who control the robots will control society
3280671 hollywood movies and tv shows such as terminator the sarah connor chronicles have been dismissed as fantastical over the years
3280672 but this report based on existing research and current technological developments suggests that robots will play a much bigger role in society over the next 75 years than previously anticipated
3280673 these robot developments could be extremely beneficial in the protection of citizens and police in the hands of benevolent governments
3280674 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

3280692 there are lots of religious options and if you try this particular religious option you might like it
3280693 pakistan has been given the all clear to hold the champions trophy the first ever in this country
3280694 i think personally from what i have seen and what i have heard and beginning to witness some of the actual security implementation measures i am quite impressed with the level of security in place
3280695 it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3280696 we have got a series of visits that follows from completing the visit to pakistan we go to australia and new zealand and speak to the boards as well as the players association and to the players themselves and then visit to england and lets see what comes out
3280697 to convince them is a big challenge and its upon us to convey the message and to raise the confidence based on what we have seen and experienced that the security arrangements in place should be sufficient to have the event safe and secure
3280698 there is a strong likelihood that karachi and lahore will hold the matches thus excluding rawalpindi as one of the three venues
3280699 with the u s economy possibly worsening is it really a good idea to use that much money to make it a full subsidiary
3280700 our hope and our belief is that this can be done in a profitable way that works for even large institutions
3280701 its suggesting that these are customers who have some kind of roots some kind of stability people who are demonstrating an ability to keep making payments
3280702 you want to protect the consumer and you want to protect the bank its not going to work if theyre losing money on it
3280703 this is not about one or two institutions we are now working with the other players in the industry
3280704 been and continues to cooperate fully with the regulators and has been working with clients since february to provide liquidity on a case by case basis
3280705 we think the banks are eager to resolve the matter
3280706 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3280707 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3280708 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3280709 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3280710 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3280711 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3280712 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3280713 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3280714 another nail in the coffin of the u s consumer who is already suffering from the weak labor market high inflation and falling house prices
3280715 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3280716 we are meeting with regulators in missouri and look forward to the discussions
3280717 getting investors their money back will continue to be a focus of the enforcement divisions investigative efforts

3280729 the whole conflict is not being waged over the pipeline the reasons are definitely geopolitical
3280730 however the russians know the pipeline is important to georgia and may try to damage it they have the capability to do so
3280731 this shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets
3280732 for europeans an alternative supply route is psychological reassurance its having a route that does not go through russia
3280733 but the other countries the pipeline passes through may ultimately prove more unreliable

3280766 me recuerda mucho al chava jim nez en triste y a pantani

3280770 a man who was merely a man and said the sort of things jesus said would not be a great moral teacher he would either be a lunatic on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg or he would be the devil of hell you must take your choice either this was and is the son of god or else a madman or something worse you can shut him up for a fool or you can fall at his feet and call him lord and god but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher he has not left that open to us
3280771 it was therefore impossible that they could have persisted in affirming the truths they have narrated had not jesus actually risen from the dead and had they not known this fact as certainly as they knew any other fact
3280772 i know pretty well what evidence is and i tell you such evidence as that for the resurrection has never broken down yet

3280782 hal itu merupakan sebuah momentum yang mengubah kehidupan saya insya allah ke jalan yang diridhai allah subhanahu wa taala dan semua itu berawal dari ibadah haji yang saya lakukan tahun 1990
3280783 saya meminta kepada jabir bin abdillah untuk mengabarkan tentang haji rasulullah saw
3280784 sesungguhnya rasulullah saw tidak berhaji selama sembilan tahun beliau diijinkan pada tahun kesepuluh pada tahun itu beliau melakukan haji lalu orang orang berdatangan ke madinah mereka semua ingin berhaji bersama rasulullah saw dan mengikuti apa yang dilakukannya
3280785 ya allah saya memenuhi panggilanmu tiada sekutu bagi mu segala puji nikmat dan kekuasaan hanya milik mu tidak ada sekutu bagi mu
3280786 mulailah dengan apa yang dimulai allah dari shafa kemudian ke marwah penerj
3280787 tiada tuhan selain allah tiada sekutu baginya ia menepati janji nya menolong hambanya dan mengalahkan musuh sendirian
3280788 seandainya saya menghadapi urusanku yang telah saya tinggalkan maka saya tidak akan mengendarai unta niscaya saya akan menjadikannya umrah
3280789 ya rasulullah apakah ini kita lakukan hanya untuk tahun ini saja ataukah untuk selama lamanya
3280790 saya mengatakan ya allah saya bertahlil beribadah sebagaimana rasul mu bertahlil
3280791 sesungguhnya darah kalian dan harta kalian haram sabagaimana keharaman harimu ini keharaman bulan ini dan keharaman tempat ini
3280792 saya telah meninggalkan kepada kalian sesuatu yang tidak akan membuat kalian tersesat setelahnya jika kalian berpegang teguh padanya yaitu kitab allah dan pertanyaan kalian tentangku hadits lalu bagaimana pendapat kalian
3280793 kami bersaksi bahwa engkau telah menyampaikan risalah engkau telah melaksanakan tugas dan memberikan nasihat
3280794 berhentilah wahai bani abdul muththalib seandainya bukan karena orang orang memenangkan kalian terhadap minuman kalian maka saya niscaya saya akan pergi bersama kalian

3280806 ripping off fans through ticket touting is something we feel is extremely unfair and exploitative
3280807 excessive profiteering by touts prevents our real fans from being able to afford tickets due to over inflated prices which for us is the most frustrating part
3280808 its difficult when a band is starting out but we are looking into other ways of selling tickets and stopping the touts getting hold of them in the first place
3280809 i tried to get tickets for the edinburgh gig but they had sold out in a couple of days i then found out there are stacks of them for sale on ebay which really annoyed me
3280810 i have followed the band for the past couple of years and saw them play in half empty halls
3280811 but now theyve got some success i just cant get a ticket for any of their shows
3280812 its not the bands fault but somebody is making an absolute fortune out of this tour and real fans like me now cant get in to see them
3280813 as a champion of consumer choice ebay believes people with legitimate tickets have the right to re sell them on the secondary market and both the government and office of fair trading have also recognised this as legitimate
3280814 we do however make it explicitly clear to anyone seeking to sell a ticket that they must specify the face value so users are aware of the original purchase price before bidding
3280815 the most exciting scottish band in the last 20 years
3280816 i think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority hierarchy and domination in every aspect of life and to challenge them unless a justification for them can be given they are illegitimate and should be dismantled to increase the scope of human freedom that includes political power ownership and management relations among men and women parents and children our control over the fate of future generations the basic moral imperative behind the environmental movement in my view and much else naturally this means a challenge to the huge institutions of coercion and control the state the unaccountable private tyrannies that control most of the domestic and international economy and so on but not only these that is what i have always understood to be the essence of anarchism the conviction that the burden of proof has to be placed on authority and that it should be dismantled if that burden cannot be met sometimes the burden can be met if im taking a walk with my grandchildren and they dart out into a busy street i will use not only authority but also physical coercion to stop them the act should be challenged but i think it can readily meet the challenge and there are other cases life is a complex affair we understand very little about humans and society and grand pronouncements are generally more a source of harm than of benefit but the perspective is a valid one i think and can lead us quite a long way
3280817 from each according to ability to each according to need
3280818 a group of friends going on a camping trip they plan their trip and each person brings useful skills and tools to share they work together to set up tents fish cook clean up with no one in a position of authority over anyone else the group organizes itself chores are done and everyone passes the time as they please alone or in groups with others people discuss their concerns and possible solutions are proposed no one is bound to go along with the group but choosing to spend time together implies a willingness to at least try to work out constructive solutions to the problems and frictions that will inevitably arise if no resolution is possible the dissenting individuals can form another grouping or leave without fear of persecution by the rest of the group

3280908 are using overblown imprecise confusing gobbledygook to try to sound big and important
3280909 its a definite business advantage and strategic advantage to communicate with clarity and coherence
3280910 all the audiences of these big companies are crying for clarity
3280911 a lot of corporations really dont know who they are
3280912 being able to describe a complex concept clearly and succinctly is really an indication of how well you know that subject
3280913 a lot of these guys they want to throw in the kitchen sink obfuscate with jargon

3280918 the 6 6 percent decline is about on pace with casinos year to date decline the decline might have been less were it not for the decline in table games which contributed more than usual for the month

3280929 from a policy perspective the question becomes do you want to keep these towns active
3280930 if you see an out migration driven by accelerating economic decline which is possible then what you may be having is people staying in these areas just because they dont want to leave and having to piece together work

3280949 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3280950 the east west energy corridor and turkey being an energy hub for the west is one of the principal arguments of turkey in its application for the eu and the need to have a good relationship with turkey
3280951 this conflict casts a shadow over turkeys foreign policy platform of creating an area of stability
3280952 this conflict could strengthen the argument for the west that if turkey is outside the tent it could create a lot of difficulties for the eu
3280953 so from the eu point of view it would make sense to bring turkey into the tent
3280954 there is also a concern that if turkey is part of the eu you are bringing the eus border to georgia and to the rest of the caucasus which might not go well in continental europe
3280955 we want stability in the region and to see fighting stop as soon as possible there is fire in the neighbors house
3280956 nichts ist besser als den kurs mit den fahrern abzugehen ber probleme zu reden sich die kerbs anzusehen die auslaufzonen zu betrachten und zu schauen wie nahe man an der mauer ist

3280961 all of the capitalistic societies of the west have mixed economies that temper capitalism
3280962 recession cutting taxes increasing government borrowing and spending during an economic down turn this was to be accompanied by trying to control wages nationally partly through the use of inflation to cut real wages and to deter people from holding money
3280963 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3280964 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3280965 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3280966 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3280967 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3280968 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3280969 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3280970 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3280971 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3280972 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3280973 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3280974 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3280975 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3280976 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3280977 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3280978 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3280979 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3280980 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3280981 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3280982 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3280983 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3280984 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3280985 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3280986 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3280987 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3280988 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3280989 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3280990 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3280991 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3280992 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3280993 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3280994 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3280995 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3280996 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3280997 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3280998 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3280999 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3281000 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3281001 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3281002 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3281003 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3281004 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3281005 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3281006 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3281007 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3281008 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings

3281025 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3281026 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3281027 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3281028 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3281029 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3281030 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3281032 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

3281064 he has been living here and he is australian so it is a good thing he will go meet players and tell them what it is like here

3281066 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett favre or management or whatever
3281067 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3281068 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3281069 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3281070 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3281071 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3281072 after a strong first half of the year the volatile multiple segment is now readjusting itself
3281073 this brings activity since the start of the year closer in line with our 2008 forecast of more than 200 000 housing starts for the seventh consecutive year
3281074 one should not read too much into an oversized drop in multiple starts in a single month
3281075 the month to month volatility in this market segment is remarkably high on both the upside and downside
3281076 the trend in single starts is usually more telling and it remains consistent with our theme for this sector of the canadian economy which is that it should experience a cooling after running too hot for too long
3281077 were most concerned about saskatchewan where the doubling of house prices in both regina and saskatoon over the past two years has led us to estimate that these two markets are now close to 50 per cent overvalued
3281078 the unemployment rate edged down 0 1 percentage points to 6 1 per cent as many people particularly youth left the labour force
3281079 the downwards trend is no surprise anyone reading the newspapers has been well aware of the flurry of plant closings and downsizing announcements
3281080 if he cuts his leg off our we liable it being our axe and all
3281081 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3281082 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3281083 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3281084 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3281085 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3281086 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3281087 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3281088 the first thing steve and i do every morning once we have the coffee made
3281089 thanks for sharing and making the world a better place
3281090 the next best thing to sitting with a friend over a cappucino
3281091 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3281092 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3281093 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3281094 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3281095 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3281096 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3281097 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3281098 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3281099 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3281100 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3281101 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3281102 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3281103 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3281104 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3281105 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3281106 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3281107 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3281108 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3281109 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3281110 according to the private espionage industry itself roughly one in four of your comrades is on a multinationals payroll
3281111 like the state security services which ended up running class war in the 1990s after a hugely successful penetration these spies work to become reliable members of any protest movement

3281113 the fact you cant see them it means nothing at all
3281114 like the state security services which ended up running class war in the 1990s after a hugely successful penetration
3281115 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3281116 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3281117 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3281139 there are no words to describe the terrible suffering of my people at this moment the chinese government is relentlessly crushing the tibetan people when they desire nothing more than the restoration of their basic rights and freedom tibetans are being killed silenced and marginalised our precious religion strangled as the chinese government attempts to extinguish all trace of tibetan identity i am protesting today to tell the world that while it stares mesmerized at chinas olympic games my people are being crushed under the boot of chinese oppression
3281140 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3281141 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

3281145 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3281146 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3281147 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3281148 toen ik ging zitten om aan mijn gesprek met de dalai lama te beginnen dacht ik nog steeds aan die contact advertenties van mensen die op zoek waren die wanhopig in contact probeerde te komen met andere mensen ik besloot opeens mijn van tevoren opgestelde lijst met vragen opzij te leggen en vroeg bent u weleens eenzaam nee gaf hij simpelweg als antwoord op dat antwoord had ik niet gerekend ik nam aan dat zijn antwoord zoiets zou luiden als natuurlijk iedereen voelt zich zo nu en dan weleens eenzaam dan zou ik hem hebben gevraagd hoe hij omging met die eenzaamheid ik had er niet op gerekend dat ik ooit nog eens iemand zou ontmoeten die zich n it eenzaam voelde nee vroeg ik opnieuw ongelovig nee waar schrijft u dat aan toe hij dacht een moment na e n factor is denk ik dat ik elk mens vanuit een positief standpunt bekijk ik probeer hun poitieve aspecten te vinden deze houding cre ert onmiddelijk een gevoel van verwantschap een soort verbondenheid en misschien komt het deels doordat ik minder bezorgd minder angstig ben dat als ik mij op een bepaalde manier gedraag de andere persoon mogelijk zijn of haar respect verliest of denkt dat ik niet helemaal in orde ben en omdat die angst en bezorgdheid er normaal gesproken niet zijn krijg je een vorm van openheid dat is denk ik de voornaamste factor

3281188 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the online gaming for the greater society studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
3281189 weve seen some very interesting commonalities across cultures ethnicities and various different societies online gaming for the greater society survey takers were very considerate in their answers and this helped us greatly to further tune our hypotheses in the end well have a great set of data to analyze and study for the future as we continue to review how online gaming for the greater society factors work in society
3281190 im very excited about tallying the data from this important online gaming for the greater society survey
3281191 this is the first time weve asked for public participation in our scientific research and were absolutely flattered and grateful by the turn out i expect preliminary results will be tabulated by next month at which point well release general findings about important online gaming for the greater society trends in this society to the local media
3281192 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the online gaming for the greater society survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of online gaming for the greater society integration in our society

3281194 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of online gaming for the greater society and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
3281195 i was impressed with the publics awareness of online gaming for the greater society trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review

3281230 sen hillary rodham clinton told a gathering of supporters last week that shes looking for a strategy for her delegates to have their voices heard and respected at the democratic national convention where sen barack obama is expected to be nominated as the democratic presidential candidate
3281231 sources close to both obama and clinton told abc news that the new york senator is highly unlikely to allow her name to be formally submitted for a roll call vote on the convention floor the obama campaign wants to avoid such a vote since it would underscore the partys splits and remind voters of the divisive primary campaign between the two democrats the refusal to publicly announce her intentions is widely seen as a bargaining chip clinton is holding on to as party officials negotiate logistics regarding her convention speech and other activities according to several democrats who are closely involved in the matter
3281232 lanny davis a longtime friend and supporter of the clintons called the idea of putting clintons name into nomination a completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony still the fact that some clinton supporters are clamoring for a chance to vote for her at the convention is partly obamas fault he said davis who described himself as 100 percent behind obama in the general election said obama should be doing more in symbolic and substantive gestures to make clear he values and needs the support of former clinton supporters

3281302 i was pretty laidback and didnt really feel that nervous
3281303 i had a decent night sleep and the warm up felt really good so that really helped my confidence
3281304 when i was walking out i couldnt stop smiling it was just amazing to be in an olympic final
3281305 i told myself to relax and enjoy the experience and the crowd were incredible ive never swum in an atmosphere like that it just drives you on
3281306 i was aching a bit from the semi because i tried so hard to get to the final
3281307 i just wanted to get into the final and improve my times i didnt have any expectations beyond that i just wanted to enjoy myself
3281308 the race started to hurt towards the end but im pleased that i hung on to sixth ive got to be happy with that this is my fastest morning swim and you cant be disappointed with that
3281309 im so pleased for rebecca we were shouting ourselves hoarse for her
3281310 its great for the team that weve won two medals already and weve got lots of good chances ahead its inspirational seeing rebecca and jo receiving their medals i cant wait for my next chance now

3281314 it is an advantage being brothers and playing in the doubles
3281315 we have played a lot together opponents though not so much in the past few years
3281316 it was a tough day for andy we wanted him to do well in the singles but he was maybe a bit flat after that and it probably translated to me a bit
3281317 he took a bit of motivating and youd expect that but to come here having just won the masters and all of a sudden hes out of the singles it was a shock for him to lose
3281318 but we got our heads together and sneaked through and now were looking forward to the next round
3281319 in this tournament a lot of the pairings are scratch because they have to split up with their usual partner to play for their country
3281320 so it helps playing with andy he is playing great and some of the best tennis of his life at the moment i think its an advantage
3281321 nestor is no 1 in the world he won wimbledon this year and he has got the golden grand slam it was very tough
3281322 i came here to try and win an olympic medal and realistically that wasnt going to happen in both competitions
3281323 the conditions were just like home and that suited me right down to the ground
3281324 we had our race suspended because of the weather on monday and we were a bit gutted but we got ourselves back out there and put in a good performance
3281325 we were definitely going out there to win and that would have been great but the us were behind us straight away
3281326 i think we were not quick enough out of the blocks and we have loads of areas for improvement so we are really looking forward to the next race
3281327 we dont get to the final until we get through the repechage so we have to treat that like our final next and then make the best of that
3281328 it is a strong field and a tough event i think we could get a final place i dont see why we shouldnt be up there and racing to get to the final

3281333 outshone the work of the cbc mainly because co hosts bob costas and matt lauer brought more information and enthusiasm to the show than did the stolid rather dull presentation of the cbcs peter mansbridge who handled most of the commentary during the first 80 minutes
3281334 how extraordinarily pleasant it was to be able to view that spectacle in beijing without the annoyance of constant exclamation and endless recitations of trivia just great swaths of wonderful silence from our narrators maclean and mansbridge between 8am and 9am or so just letting the show at the stadium tell its own story with the least obtrusive economy of helpful footnotes no urgency whatsoever to riddle the air with inane nattering and relentless fill

3281338 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3281339 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3281340 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3281341 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3281342 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3281343 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3281344 that was a huge performance boy did he knock it out of the park
3281345 we really needed that pommel horse routine and he hit it big time
3281346 after all we went through to get here we did amazingly well
3281347 all we said was be consistent be consistent they did a tremendous job
3281348 when you look at the guys that are out on the floor these are the guys that have been fighting through the trenches the last three years on the international level
3281349 we kept saying this was a team of nine and we almost needed them all artemev and raj really came through
3281350 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3281351 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3281352 we will try to keep as much of the original show as possible
3281353 this was a string of bad luck if you like
3281354 i mean we are in a very very difficult environment in afghanistan
3281355 youve got darkness youve got dust pilots under pressure because of potential threats and these accidents will occur
3281356 weve also moved into a period of increased intensity its what they refer to as somewhat tragically in afghanistan as fighting season
3281357 so it is a tough fight but its an important fight

3281360 going forward though headline inflation is easing overall inflation pressure remains relatively high with the non food consumer price index and producer price index surging to 2 1 yoy and a twelve year high at 10 0 in july respectively we expect beijing will continue to use credit rationing to deal with inflationary pressure in the coming months
3281361 theres a temptation to read this as a sign that inflation is easing but in fact inflation pressure is still firm
3281362 yesterdays high producer price inflation was a warning that inflation pressures remain

3281365 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
3281366 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
3281367 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
3281368 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
3281369 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
3281370 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
3281371 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
3281372 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
3281373 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
3281374 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
3281375 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
3281376 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
3281377 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
3281378 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
3281379 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
3281380 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
3281381 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
3281382 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
3281383 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
3281384 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
3281385 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
3281386 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
3281387 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
3281388 einer der beiden d rfte drau en schmiere gestanden sein
3281389 looked calm i think his balls were pretty much on time excellent accuracy
3281390 the signs i saw in the stands were very positive and encouraging
3281391 i think it hit him right between the 8 and 3
3281392 we throw that pass a lot it looked like it was right there
3281393 i dont think you can make a generalization about the secondary depth on two plays
3281394 youre always concerned about players not doing the right thing if they give up those kinds of plays the next game then i will be more concerned
3281395 but its different out here than it is in the game well have to wait until the game to see if they really learned anything
3281396 i treat every day the same regardless of what happens in the game good bad whatever thats how im always going to approach it
3281397 clowney was fast everyones fast they had a good play and that was pretty much it we had to do our job and we didnt we dont want to ever give up touchdowns we worked on it were good
3281398 it all comes down to making a big play and preventing the big play
3281399 overall they had a pretty decent night they had two big plays that make it look like they did a horrible job we made sure they corrected those mistakes those guys are working hard every day out here and in the classroom to make sure those kinds of things dont happen
3281400 you see one or two plays go over their head but overall they came back
3281401 a j did well theyre young so theyre still learning
3281402 we couldnt wait to get this started were sick of practice
3281403 so i have this light on on my dash and it says its a tire pressure warning only i checked all my tires and theyre all ok at 32 psi
3281404 did you check your spare on those rav4s its usually the spare that does that
3281405 so where exactly is the spare tire on my car do i have to crank it down or anything
3281406 generally on the rav4s the spare tire is on the back
3281407 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3281408 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3281409 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3281410 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3281411 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3281412 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3281413 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3281414 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3281415 overall the sentiment is not bad for stocks as commodities retreat but appetite for some metal and energy shares is falling a bit

3281460 just before woodstock this guy ran past me and started robbing the girls behind me
3281461 i couldnt just ignore it and i got up and tried to get his weapon but he turned on me with his knife there was also another guy robbing others while this was happening
3281462 the guy stabbed me in the chest i was bleeding the three girls were screaming
3281463 i got out at woodstock station and an ambulance was called i was very very lucky that the knife didnt pierce anything major it went through skin and muscle so i had to have stitches
3281464 why i risked getting involved is very important i think people in south africa dont have a very good sense of community we all need to do what we can to help each other out i felt compelled to enter the situation if it happens again ill do the same thing
3281465 i went to try to restrain him the next time i will be more forceful and if necessary violent
3281466 the affair began long long long before she was hired to work for the campaign almost half a year before she was hired to work on those videos
3281467 she was hired to come in and produce films and thats the reason she was hired
3281468 she said they had a very deep connection and they were spending time together in a romantic and sexual way very you know very early on in a very intense way
3281469 if he would just come forward and tell the whole truth i think then this would all go away
3281470 i wish people would concentrate on russia and georgia and not on whom john edwards screwed
3281471 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3281472 its not helpful in uniting the party its wistful thinking i would like to see howard use his skills to unite the party
3281473 its a useless comment and unhelpful to party unity the party is coming together
3281474 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3281475 a lot of edwards supporters went to obama after edwards exited the race iowa was voting for change
3281476 lurching to the right then to the left the old washington dance whatever it takes
3281477 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls non runners
3281478 we do know that alcohol may have been involved even though that wont be a factor in charging him
3281479 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3281480 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3281481 they didnt date they were introduced they decided to get married and then he divorced her to get his green card
3281482 after the courthouse wedding she did not see him again
3281483 just the other day i put 20 in and i barely got 4 gallons now my pockets are filling up a bit instead
3281484 she left him twice she was scared for her life
3281485 then fled into a neighboring compound where they held 11 noncombatants hostage including several children and an infant
3281486 this is about a courageous courageous 8 year old boy who showed more guts than the people who were around there
3281487 full scale cyber war being conducted by russia against georgia
3281488 russia appears to have targeted the ge domain for specific government web sites and are pounding the georgian military networks
3281489 we have got to stop this frenzy about spending and lack of accountability
3281490 we need from the legislature real and reoccurring cuts we need a sense of understanding of how serious this problem can get
3281491 its important that the governor and legislature not take any actions that would force local governments to raise their local taxes to make up for a shortfall from albany
3281492 we are concerned that reducing local government assistance funding may do just that
3281493 we will review the proposals advanced today by the governor and will continue to work with the governor and with our colleagues in the senate to address the challenges brought on by the current recession
3281494 were talking and hugging and crying and trying to get through it together
3281495 he has very distinguishable features a very big nose his wig couldnt cover his nose
3281496 when we won control over the public schools in june 2002 as you know graduation rates had been stagnant for a decade
3281497 tens of thousands of kids each year were being cheated out of the education they needed and the recognition of all the work they had been doing
3281498 i dont think you can overstate the value of a high school diploma
3281499 every expert and every study agree that graduating high school can be a significant perhaps the most significant dividing line between a life of struggle and a life of success
3281500 he loved the army even after his baby was born he wanted to stay in to give those benefits to his son
3281501 he gave chocolate to this little girl in iraq and all these young kids came up to him
3281502 as a soldier youre supposed to be strong but he said his heart just melted
3281503 the odds of the suspects stumbling on this were astronomical
3281504 would only happen if you used an active debit card but had insufficient money in your account and it was from a smaller nonlocal bank
3281505 its not like him to be involved in something like this
3281506 he vowed not to be in volved in criminal activity and it looked like he was turning his life around
3281507 the woman stumbled on it unwittingly and they proceeded to very knowingly steal form the mta
3281508 shes funny looking and she wears polyester pantsuits and that just makes me laugh
3281509 theres nothing funnier to me than stupid people being evil because they put a tack on your chair and expect it to kill you
3281510 some guy with an ice box could shuck his eyes out
3281511 i said it may be best to write it and not send it he sent me a copy of it i was shocked by half the stuff in there i know his feelings were very badly hurt you know how people can equate money with love
3281512 he was having a hard time sucking up to her
3281513 and i looked up and saw a picture of jerry and it was the eye bank ad and i thought nobody on this train knows how freaked out i am
3281514 actually untruths and variations on stories and whatever and i didnt know who chris was talking about
3281515 he used to call me every friday when she went out
3281516 he would whisper in the phone she wants me to marry her
3281517 although i had always identified myself as hispanic this was the first time it had been thrust towards me from the outside as something that set me apart
3281518 i am a female hispanic scandinavian performance artist but simultaneously and more simply i am an american artist
3281519 i assume this hire is in response to all the crap theyve been getting about playing loose and fast with the budget and rewriting the rules for themselves
3281520 its very difficult to get information on how much a particular service winds up costing and what the department of education is spending on this or that function
3281521 i think it makes perfect sense for schools chancellor joel klein to look to somebody with wall street expertise
3281522 george is a highly capable financial officer and will be an asset to the board of education thats for sure
3281523 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3281524 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3281525 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats
3281526 its as if they are taunting like kids to each other in school its a very childish advertisement
3281527 its definitely not sending a message of sportsmanship and is insensitive not only to the chinese but to all asians
3281528 people think it is harmless and its ok but little do they realize the history of it this goes back to when the chinese and the japanese were not allowed to come here and were painted as evil and demonic
3281529 i think what i will do is track down their address and send them a carton full of visine to help them get the red out
3281530 madrid is a city that wants to do more than aspire to the olympic ideal it wants to live those values through the games with the human touch
3281531 i dont know how shes going to be doing when she hears this
3281532 because of the overwhelming size of the collection we decided the best and expeditious course of action was to publicize the art work to the general public
3281533 whether he was a thief or a good faith purchase r we couldnt come to a conclusion on that
3281534 all we know is he ended up with the stuff
3281535 most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3281536 we believe mac performance is due to several unique drivers that were not present in prior downturns we anticipate that apple will continue to grow at a multiple of the overall market for many years to come
3281537 first apple has successfully reduced the perceived and actual switching costs for windows users looking to adopt the mac platform second apples support of the intel architecture has levelled the playing field in terms of speeds and feeds comparisons between macs and pcs
3281538 id like to thank everyone for all the support and kind wishes ive received since becoming ill and of course the medical team who have looked after me for the last few weeks
3281539 if it wasnt for their professionalism the outcome could have been much worse
3281540 he certainly likes his new portfolio a lot and that may have something to do with that
3281541 not exactly the foot that most canadians would want to see put forward
3281542 we recognize that theres a need to properly monitor individuals who are on parole in the federal system
3281543 literally every moment of the day a persons location can be verified
3281544 its incumbent upon the government to clearly set out the criteria for inclusion within the program
3281545 we believe we can do this without violating the rights of a violent offender
3281546 this is the first government i have seen in my life as a canadian since 1968 that has politicized the correctional system
3281547 by all means marry if you get a good wife youll be happy if you get a bad one youll become a philosopher

3281555 i am stunned at the reaction to my comments in the custom pc article i thought this was an old story
3281556 via no longer sells some or all of these chipsets
3281557 we havent been shipping chipsets for intel processors for a while now and are only shipping a limited volume of chipsets for amd chipsets
3281558 this comprises only a very small proportion of our total business our processor business makes up the vast majority of our revenues

3281560 we get called cheats nearly every week so you get a bit sick of it in the end
3281561 you just try and play within the laws and you want to be competitive at scrum time they are going to want to attack us on our ball angel in on me and do whatever they can to disrupt us that said the same happens for us when it is there ball and lets not kid people dont want to see scrums become nothing do they people still want to see a bit of the good old stuff as two teams go at each other so i wouldnt call it cheating rather two teams having a go at each other its not cheating but just two teams having a dig at each other and i guess it comes down to who is interpreting it but i dont see it as cheating
3281562 it was really just an attitude thing and we changed a few tactics that the boys played too pretty well but most of it was upstairs in the mind
3281563 in that first test against the wallabies we played a little too much helter skelter rugby by running every free kick and getting ahead of ourselves a little
3281564 they scrummed really well against argentina from what i saw
3281565 just getting a win in south africa would be nice really
3281566 we did some driver work along with this bridge chip to make this somewhat seamless

3281568 we are very excited that 16 years on we are still going strong the show has gone from strength to strength every year and we will continue to improve it and adapt to ever changing trends in childrens toys to make the show bigger and better
3281569 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3281570 world history is often made in remote obscure countries it is being made in georgia today
3281571 the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3281572 both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states of america
3281573 the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated
3281574 there have been many turning points for good and ill this is another turning point let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3281575 i looked into mr putins eyes and i saw three things a k and a g and a b
3281576 the kremlin and the obama campaign are using the same talking points to attack john mccains statement against russian aggression in georgia
3281577 a cheap shot at me as if helping a struggling democracy is somehow wrong
3281578 because our standing in the world is so low and so weak were not able to
3281579 it is a cold war type scenario already and pretending otherwise is misreading the writing on the wall russia has demonstrated its desire to ignore international public opinion and use force
3281580 were getting together a mission statement and brochure and letter and materials appropriate for captains to ask their natural constituents to help
3281581 i hate to lead with my chin but i have to say its one of the easiest sells ive been involved in
3281582 it is the single most important thing other than family and health that senator kennedy is focused on
3281583 he will be gratified if things go forward as a salute to him and an institution he loves at a place he loves
3281584 the united states senate is one of our forefathers most brilliant democratic inventions
3281585 to preserve our vibrant democracy for future generations i believe it is critical to have a place where citizens can go to learn first hand about the senates important role in our system of government im looking forward to getting the institute up and running soon
3281586 to have an edward m kennedy institute on a umass campus is very exciting very exciting
3281587 this has its closest analogy in the presidential libraries but those cover a four to eight year period this is a lot longer time period and its a completely different style of politics
3281588 wed like to have republicans and democrats on an advisory board wed like to have lectures from senators on both sides of the aisle
3281589 it really is a model about government the presidency of john f kennedy and the senate career of edward m kennedy this will be a model in perpetuity that will remember the short time we had president kennedy and the many years weve had with senator kennedy
3281590 she was not at that mindset when i knew her i dont what could have led to that
3281591 both of them were looking like they were prepared for suicide
3281592 she doesnt know how many years but it was the same location and her captors were americans and the treatment was horrendous
3281593 kindly fill the pledge form and return to al kifah
3281594 she shared with us that we should never make excuses for who we are
3281595 she said americans have no respect for people who are weak
3281596 she was petrified because the fbi had put her on a most wanted list
3281597 for several years we have had no information regarding her whereabouts whatsoever
3281598 it is our belief that she has all this time been concealed from the public view by her own choosing
3281599 now they feel that school is over all they want to do is watch tv or just lay back on the computer and eat
3281600 its like no school video game city its really very sad
3281601 you would think the summer would be a time when kids are really active and running around
3281602 for many kids its the opposite they have a lot of down time in the summer that theyre trying to fill
3281603 summer can be a very difficult time financially for families
3281604 so this is a particularly interesting time to be thinking about the influences of this summer on obesity and kids
3281605 we asked the question when it comes to childhood obesity are schools more part of the solution or more part of the problem
3281606 families have agendas that are related to vacation and traveling so its very difficult for the child to adhere to
3281607 and then theyre not on a good schedule at home because there are times when they are bored and they have more access to the refrigerator because the parent is at work
3281608 because it affects both ends of the energy balance equation
3281609 when children are watching television theyre not at the beach or playing basketball in the back yard burning off calories but also theyre receiving an unending series of messages by way of commercials to eat the highest calorie lowest quality food imaginable
3281610 a lot of the kids today dont have the basic fundamental games that we did
3281611 we are really going to feel the effects that technology is having on our children in 10 years and were all going to pay a steep cost
3281612 when theyre in school they have their breakfast their lunch
3281613 summertime brings the ice cream the smoothies all the tempting stuff this will help them resist that when theyre adults
3281614 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3281615 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3281616 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3281617 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material
3281618 bent only played at the end of last season but
3281619 baldini told me he played very well so we will have to wait and see
3281620 the most important games will be played on sunday so it is dangerous
3281621 we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it
3281622 spain were the best team at the euros they won because they played with confidence
3281623 the other countries played with a lot of spirit and the level of their players was good but we are at the same level or better
3281624 we have to play with spirit and we have to play with confidence it is down to me to transmit it
3281625 he knew that if he hit tskhinvali the south ossetian capital the russians would hit georgia now they are bombing us into oblivion
3281626 we need to know whether we are still under moscows rule or whether we are protected by the west
3281627 were not sure anymore whether the west defends us russia feels like it can do whatever it wants we dont feel safe anymore
3281628 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3281629 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3281630 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3281631 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3281632 not exactly the greatest hand of cards to have to play
3281633 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3281634 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3281635 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3281636 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3281637 not exactly the greatest hand of cards to have to play
3281638 it has been a long journey theres a lot of relief that the training was definitely worth it
3281639 i was really about to quit after athens and i was very very close to giving up the sport i just didnt enjoy doing what i was doing
3281640 over the past four years ive really found some enjoyment again and i never thought id be here i thought i was just deemed to be a bronze medallist
3281641 i am delighted i couldnt care less about the time
3281642 an olympic gold is an olympic gold the time the race none of it matters its all about the gold
3281643 ive got so much more growing to do and more learning ive only been working with my coach rohan taylor for a year and i think ive got so much left in me
3281644 pengalamannya ivan red dalam bidang teknologi dan kepemimpinannya terutama di bidang ukm dan pasar kelas menengah akan membantu indonesia tumbuh sebagai pilar kunci pertumbuhan emc di wilayah ini
3281645 da beide bisschen gepatzt haben und das war gut weil die synchronwertung nicht ganz so runter ging
3281646 es w re sch n wenn unsere sportart mehr aufmerksamkeit in der ffentlichkeit bekommt
3281647 bei uns wird an der einmal beschlossenen konzeption festgehalten dass bei uns einer mitten auf dem ozean pl tzlich in die andere richtung rudert gibt es nicht
3281648 unsere springer haben durch viele wettk mpfe gelernt mit der extremen belastung umzugehen
3281649 ich bin vom druck berrollt werden so schlimm hatte ich mir diesen wettkampf nicht vorgestellt
3281650 es ist unglaublich welchen druck die chinesische presse auf ihre sportler aus bt die k nnen einem leid tun
3281651 ich f hle jetzt nicht so viel druck wie vor vier jahren
3281652 ich bin so gl cklich zu hause gewonnen zu haben es war nicht so leicht wie die meisten menschen glauben
3281653 sie hatte talent wir haben sie sehr gedr ngt ihr potenzial zu entwickeln es war sehr hart f r das m dchen und sie weinte oft aber sie gab nie auf

3281661 the guard had his face all beaten i saw him the next morning with a broken nose
3281662 the guard was punched and he punched back in defense it was just one blow the man died because he fell with his head on the stone floor
3281663 the guards main fault was that he should not have responded by hitting back but to push a button to call the police
3281664 hes a young guy hes only 22 so he chose to hit back thats all but what they write about a guard beating somebody to death is nonsense
3281665 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3281666 a few of these guys are going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3281667 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3281668 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3281669 it felt good to get out there and just start banging heads with other people
3281670 at the least i saw a guy who was getting upfield and getting after the passer
3281671 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3281672 we were in the gym and i asked him if i could take a picture with him
3281673 he said hows your leg you are in my heart i hope everythings coming on i texted my mother and told her she was shocked
3281674 ive been looking for an indicator to let me know where im going to be at and i think sundays workout let me know
3281675 for what profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul
3281676 even if you fought 19 grandmothers in a row its still kind of notable to get all of them out of there in the first round
3281677 look i know tyrone has been moved slow there have been some bumps along the way but were on the way now ive seen him spar with guys like
3281678 i truly believe tyrone has what it takes to be special hes got everything hes got the heart hes got the chin and obviously he has the power
3281679 after the olympics im hopeful it can be built back up to where it was
3281680 this is something thats needed for these kids to get an education through boxing weve had a lot of kids who graduated from high school others who have gone on to get college degrees we even have some who got their masters no other program in boxing offers what we do
3281681 we look forward to having such a program here for many decades in the future
3281682 after the loss to yuri i spent some time with my family and hooking up with visionquest where i worked with kids
3281683 but now im ready to jump back in the saddle
3281684 i just went up there wanting to put the ball in play
3281685 i made good contact and the ball just took off you dont go up there looking for home runs but when they help the team win its a good feeling
3281686 baru kali ini saya menemukan obat yang sangat mujarab daya penyebuhannya alhamdulillah saya bersyukur kepada allah karena telah dapat menolong banyak penderita penderita penyakit penyakit berat
3281687 i love them both but they want to see what their value is
3281688 most times guys choose to be free agents though its tough to get them back
3281689 the date aug 10 was right up on us i really hope in my heart to be back i really want to be in philadelphia
3281690 the victim in the present case was a foreigner lady who was totally dependent on the hospitality provided to her by our people
3281691 in our case the victim was of such an age that she should have been seen by the convicts as a motherly figure
3281692 this is my simple religion there is no need for temples no need for complicated philosophy our own brain our own heart is our temple the philosophy is kindness
3281693 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties and needs no religious basis is necessary man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
3281694 dont do that what did i say stop it i said stop etc etc
3281695 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
3281696 who knows maybe it will be a usd 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
3281697 last i heard he was doing some online stuff in china
3281698 every now and again hell come up with an idea and i dont think anything has come out of that yet but were still working with him hes not an employee anymore but
3281699 its a limited exclusive so if i were to try to make a ps3 or wiiware version of the game i would have to wait a little bit
3281700 playstation 3 might happen in the future whats going to definitely happen this year is a pc release the only reason thats not out right now is that i wanted to focus on one platform at a time
3281701 wiiware is not going to happen for this game because the model is just not right like braid is too big of a game to be downloadable on wiiware and stored on someones wii
3281702 a lot of people think oh 3d is really complicated and is big but 2d art like all the bitmaps in braid takes a lot of space the game is 144mb right now
3281703 im not going to do a sequel to braid i dont care how many copies it sells
3281704 i mean maybe in five years when im motivated if i have a really fresh idea for it but im not waiting in the wings with a level pack or dlc or anything
3281705 for a guy that really played with a lot of pain and injury he did a good job johnson said
3281706 im happy with him happy with his progress he just needs to play more
3281707 im a little banged up small injuries here and there laws said
3281708 i felt i did pretty good i made some decent plays tons to work on a lot of good film to study
3281709 anytime you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3281710 there are some things i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown
3281711 and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support there are some good things too i take the good with the bad with that i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3281712 i think we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3281713 in the boards view these realistic visual representation of drugs and their delivery method bring the science fiction drugs in line with real world drugs
3281714 i can change things last second i can tell him personnel are coming onto the field i can tell him down and distance youd have to talk to him but i think he likes it
3281715 ironing some kinks out we ended up changing the headset jim was using went from wired to wireless i could hear better on the wireless the wired set was picking up a lot more crowd noise
3281716 with the hand signals the corners can kind of stay out away from the huddle which cuts down on their running time just a little
3281717 now they have to come in the huddle so its going to be a little adjustment period for those guys
3281718 im happy with him i think we had maybe just one mistake as far as when he was playing in there but he did a pretty good job overall
3281719 legs werent the most fresh but i felt pretty good
3281720 first of all you just want to get them out there working
3281721 he needs to play a little he hasnt played yet hopefully hes going to be ready to go thursday night were going to play him quite a bit hes just got to get used to that playing speed with us and get used to the defense thats the main thing
3281722 id probably put him at 90 to 95 percent well have to see how tired he gets because thats what you worry about with the hamstring if he gets tired thats when you have to worry about a pull
3281723 we didnt play the way we wanted to in those friendlies
3281724 i couldnt ask for anything else so far phelps said
3281725 weve done everything weve wanted to do im very happy with how things have gone so far
3281726 to be tied with all those names from olympic history
3281727 its definitely an honor ive been able to spend some time with carl lewis and had some words with spitz here and there its pretty amazing
3281728 i wanted to try and get out into open water i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me i knew tae hwan park of korea was going to have a good last 50 so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3281729 we extended a little bit more than what we anticipated
3281730 but after observing him down in the bullpen today it was well worth it
3281731 i was unsure about signing and the money wasnt there
3281732 cole gave me a call and we talked about it
3281733 i guess he sent his son over here for me to mess up
3281734 i felt strong so its up to them right now im going to be ready to throw if they dont call down they dont call down but im ready
3281735 put it this way before the all star game it was feeling a little maybe like i had a tiny bit of tendinitis in there not bad
3281736 if i would have just thrown regular at the all star game it probably would have gone away because i had the other 3 days off over the break but that didnt allow it to recover it didnt help it at all i dont want to say the all star game caused it to be bad but obviously it didnt help it
3281737 on my scouting trips i used to be amazed there would be kids at 11 a m in the morning playing baseball many of them didnt go to school
3281738 they have a great deal of passion for baseball they love it they play it they know its history
3281739 when i was active in baseball we had a few latins here and there
3281740 now theyve pretty much taken charge but only because they can play thats the bottom line they can play
3281741 there are many great players from my country now as time goes by there will only be more
3281742 i was working in a factory that made jeans and we had a baseball team that played on weekends
3281743 this was around 1979 i was 18 and with the money i made at the factory i bought a motorcycle i was riding that motorcycle when my sister found me and said there was a scout waiting for me at my moms house
3281744 i didnt think she knew anything about baseball let alone scouts so i wasnt going to go
3281745 there were a lot of guys in the past who just got too old because nobody saw them they were good players who didnt make it because nobody saw them play now its easier because every team is down there if youre good somebody is going to know that
3281746 its much more in depth and sophisticated now than when i first started
3281747 there were a few organizations that were aggressive in the dominican or venezuela but now we have a scouting network in each one of the countries and its not only us but nearly every club in baseball
3281748 i just felt like a kid in a candy store
3281749 this is the beginning its all coming true it feels very good inside
3281750 once i got to athens and i was watching that meet take place it sank in how difficult it is to come so close to be given a free ticket to the olympic games as an athlete and then have to watch it
3281751 that is a very tough emotion to swallow but i had to put my personal ambition aside for the team its a selfless position to be an alternate i couldnt have been happier for those guys when they garnered that medal in a way we were all part of that every gymnast back home was a part of that team usa goes a lot deeper than just the six guys here
3281752 you have to dig to the center of your heart
3281753 i said there was no extrinsic award that was going to take away my sense of inner accomplishment and that is true
3281754 but i found out as the days progressed that living those words is actually a challenge ill be the first to tell you its no easy task i had to continuously dig down deep and reach into the toolbox at times and pull out the proper tool in order to keep me going and keep me motivated

3281761 he knows the game and he can communicate the rhythm and timing on broadcasts will come in time
3281762 he was one of the good ones who came out of here
3281763 its a very proud feeling knowing that someone from here is coming home with the gold it was overwhelming to actually see it
3281764 even if no else was there hed be in there practicing
3281765 watching how passionate he was about it got me into swimming he was a great role model always trying to help someone out
3281766 jumping up and down screaming and crying at the same time

3281768 they are using half people karolyi said after the tiny chinese womens team grabbed a significant lead over the americans in team competition sunday night
3281769 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
3281770 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like he said
3281771 you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
3281772 they understood it a 10 is perfect that is good for the sport what is this system they say it cannot be manipulated it can be manipulated

3281775 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3281776 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3281777 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3281778 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3281779 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3281780 clearly elisabeth is a victim in this as well obviously she physically was unscathed having to deal with this has been hard for her she has shown incredible strength the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it
3281781 obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
3281782 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3281783 we are very disappointed to hear the news of another arrest of one of our student athletes
3281784 colby covington has been suspended indefinitely from all ui athletic program activities i am extremely disappointed with all that has been going on the last couple weeks
3281785 this is an unfortunate situation that will be taken seriously
3281786 we will be looking into the matter further once we have obtained all the details of this incident
3281787 we were always going to go over just on the chance he made weight and there was someone who withdrew or someone who got injured
3281788 youve got to think positive and thats why im going my gut feeling tells me hes going to get in and thats just the way i believe
3281789 i learned i had a lot of stuff to work on
3281790 i learned that its going to take a lot to affect me to be honest we went through a lot last year as an offense and that falls on my shoulders which is fine i wouldnt have it any other way i learned i can take that thats what i suspected but until you go through it you dont really know
3281791 jake is the front runner but hes got to earn the job
3281792 hes got to play the position better than he did a year ago just like id expect from anybody who is a returning starter
3281793 i thought his decision making was good his leadership was great he handled the media great
3281794 i thought he did a pretty darn nice job we couldve executed and completed the ball at a higher percentage but i always think that i thought that of brad banks when he was no 1 in the country in pass efficiency
3281795 someone needed to tell me before it was too late and im glad he did and im glad i went through it making some fundamental mistakes and realizing i had something to work on the tendency is to get kind of stubborn about it and say i dont have to fix anything but i did and i have and i think its going to be a real good outcome
3281796 its hard to argue with a 17 year nfl veteran
3281797 pretty much what he says goes hes got teams calling him off the hook nfl teams calling him wanting him to come help out and coach id go out on a limb and say hes probably the best quarterback coach there is theres no doubt in my mind from what ive been around i havent met them all

3281800 in the last two years 19 bills have been introduced in state legislatures in the us none of them have yet passed what it shows is that there is significant popular demand for a solution to junk mail and enough so that some politicians felt that they had a stable foundation on which to introduce legislation but there is also signficant opposition and well financed opposition to a do not mail registry

3281826 we thank alexi for the tremendous hard work and dedication he brought to his job each and every day

3281844 aside from the fact that insurance companies are now asking that programs have fact accreditation getting the organizations approval means that your program has conformed to rigorous standards that are meant to ensure a high quality of patient care
3281845 at that time there was really nothing in terms of regulation or literature regarding the regulation of cell therapies

3281903 tribute offers our customers a distinctive and authentic regional ale and is a welcome addition to our carefully selected range of beers available in store
3281904 these brakspear licensees should feel justifiably proud of this excellent achievement which not only recognises the effort they put into serving the perfect pint but also acts as an independent guarantee of quality for customers
3281905 all too often publicans dont appreciate the care and attention cask beers require and then run the risk of losing custom by serving pints that are below par
3281906 the black horse is a great addition to the charles wells stable as it presents the kind of well structured business that were working on for all of our pubs

3281910 im getting calls from casino computer programmer volunteers industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular casino computer programmer volunteers company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
3281911 the recent news in the casino computer programmer volunteers industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
3281912 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other casino computer programmer volunteers entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
3281913 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the casino computer programmer volunteers market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong casino computer programmer volunteers usa companies that move forward

3281924 i know grown men who wont walk from pub to pub in casino

3281926 there are a number of things the public could do such as not getting intoxicated and walk home alone travel in groups use public transport
3281927 its fair to say that the onus is on us but the public can also help
3281928 the difficulty with dirt bikes is that they often occur in remote locations and it can take a while for people on the scene to contact help because of poor communications
3281929 it can sometimes be an hour or more before we are aware that an accident has happened
3281930 he is also a level one coach and teaches novice riders safety skills the biggest danger is coming across other riders or vehicles on the track or things that are not normally there like a rock or a log things that you dont expect to be on the trail
3281931 its important to be prepared at all times you can get into a relaxed state and not be thinking about it if something jumps up in front of you and youre not ready for it it can catch you off guard and you can end up on your back or on your side
3281932 most people who ride know its a dangerous sport if you dont know that you probably shouldnt be riding
3281933 ive learned from every major team i have been on and every commonwealth games i wasnt hugely happy with my performance in athens and im using that as good motivation

3281935 an experience with elitist students preaching eugenics against the poor
3281936 there will be some tv coverage of our events sbs is showing highlights of the slalom heats on wednesday
3281937 channel 7 seem to have a schedule with all the sports but i havent worked out whether that means theyll actually be showing the slalom
3281938 during the last olympics sbs covered the slalom but werent initially going to show the finals
3281939 we asked all slalom fans to call sbs and say how wonderful the coverage of canoe slalom was and that theyd really like to see the finals and it worked
3281940 his pupils were fixed and dilated and he had lacerations to his forehead and there was some bleeding from his nose when we realised he was unstable we arranged for him to be airlifted to the gold coast
3281941 we searched every where for him and i started to panic thinking that maybe someone had taken him or that he had wondered off it really wasnt like him to go and hide
3281942 i called the police and then searched the house again i did actually look under the bed but he had hidden himself well under there
3281943 i felt silly when i found him and told the police but they just smiled
3281944 there will be a further adjustment of fuel rebate to the manufacturing sector from 10 cents per litre to 5 cents per litre the industry will now pay 4 cents as opposed to 8 paid cents currently
3281945 i believe it was time to move on when this opportunity became available to serve in another local financial institution where i can use my 23 plus years of banking experience
3281946 it is a bit too early to make any comparisons as yet on the two companies
3281947 to continue the good work left by my predecessors where merchant finance remains the number one contributor to fijian holdings performance
3281948 and also the board has certain exciting strategies for the company that i have to explore and implement
3281949 our hfc team is very good that i will continue to develop and empower
3281950 merchant finance and investment ltd had always had very a strong performance
3281951 in the current economic environment influenced by both local and global activities we have to maintain close watch and oversight on the credit quality and effective risk management
3281952 the company is publicly listed and a successful investment company owned by our indigenous fijian community
3281953 fiji will not forget that when other countries were quick to condemn us following the events of 1987 2000 and in 2006 china and other friends in asia demonstrated a more understanding and sensitive approach to events in fiji
3281954 the government of the peoples republic of china expressed confidence in our ability to resolve our problems in our way without undue pressure or interference
3281955 the chinese government even went further to provide much needed development assistance in crucial areas of development our national sports complex is a tangible example
3281956 coups can happen anytime there is no stopping anyone from picking up a gun and ousting the government

3281962 i saw the men on fire inside the vehicle they were crying for help
3281963 people rushed to the vehicle and started pulling out the dead and injured the police arrived at the scene after an hour
3281964 the east west energy corridor and turkey being an energy hub for the west is one of the principal arguments of turkey in its application for the eu and the need to have a good relationship with turkey
3281965 this conflict casts a shadow over turkeys foreign policy platform of creating an area of stability
3281966 this conflict could strengthen the argument for the west that if turkey is outside the tent it could create a lot of difficulties for the eu
3281967 so from the eu point of view it would make sense to bring turkey into the tent
3281968 there is also a concern that if turkey is part of the eu you are bringing the eus border to georgia and to the rest of the caucasus which might not go well in continental europe
3281969 we want stability in the region and to see fighting stop as soon as possible there is fire in the neighbours house
3281970 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3281971 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3281972 apparently it was an improvised explosive device that hit the bus
3281973 the us feds senior loan officer survey showed a marked tightening of credit it was most acute in the consumer area where both standards on credit cards and on other consumer loans tightened sharply between the second and third quarters commercial lending has also been squeezed significantly both us consumer spending and investment are set to suffer in h2 with implications for growth and commodity prices in the rest of the world looking across the categories consumer loan supply has been restricted for prime residential mortgages 70 of banks reported that credit standards tightened somewhat none reported an easing for home equity credit lines 59 reported that loans standards tightened somewhat and 22 said that they had tightened considerably none noted an easing the renewed lending restriction for credit cards and consumer loans was just as obvious all of this means that the housing market is going to find it difficult to recover and consumer spending may decline in h2 the lack of access to equity withdrawal is a big change from the 2003 2005 period likewise the responses for business lending whether related to commercial real estate or commercial and industrial loans suggest that investment will dip in h2 a us recession is looking more likely as the tax stimulus fades the negative knock on impact on growth in the rest of the world means that commodities may only be starting a correction
3281974 la stabilisation laquelle nous avons faire face actuellement nous laisse penser que le pic d inflation est derri re nous

3281978 les prix la consommation sont toujours en moyenne plus faibles en juillet quen juin
3281979 clinical trials incorporating qca have made a significant impact in cardiovascular drug and device development
3281980 building qca capabilities into mira represents the latest in a series of innovations designed to boost the integrity and reproducibility of clinical trial data and enhances our leadership in the field of imaging within clinical research
3281981 while many have thought that people wont be able to take medicines as well as they need to due to limited resources in poor countries our review of all studies on the topic strongly suggests that children in low income countries are able to maintain at least a comparable degree of art adherence if not better adherence than children in high income countries
3281982 healthcare systems need to carefully monitor how children with hiv take their medicines this kind of monitoring can be particularly difficult in low income countries so its very helpful for healthcare providers to understand how others do this monitoring and how well its working
3281983 we were not completely surprised to find the high rate of adherence to art in children in low income countries because it mirrors the results of adult studies but there is no question that it is reassuring to learn that even in settings where families face many challenges children are still able to adhere to a demanding yet essential medication regimen
3281984 our efforts to increase access to art must be coupled with research to inform strategies to deliver that therapy
3281985 childhood bereavement in the 21st century spectrums of support for bereaved children and those who care for them
3281986 giving children and young people a voice is a key priority for me
3281987 children who are bereaved are too often left out of the wider familys grieving process i think very often we think of the adult first of all and not the young people that are involved
3281988 conferences like this are about educating the adults that come into contact with those young people and showing how they can better understand what it is actually like for a young person who is going through that grieving process
3281989 the work of cruse help parents and carers understand the needs of children and young people and help them through this traumatic time
3281990 up to 30 000 children per year are impacted by the death of someone close to them thats a huge number of children dealing with death and loss
3281991 delivering face to face bereavement support services to children and young people alongside services for adults is an integral part of cruses work and a big aspect of that is supporting those adults who care for bereaved young people
3281992 the conference is for parents carers professionals and anyone who wants to know how they can best support children and young people who are facing the devastation of bereavement
3281993 the young people are the experts they are the ones who can tell us what its like to be bereaved and what support they need
3281994 these new figures are truly alarming and confirm that diabetes is one of the biggest health challenges facing the uk today
3281995 there are currently 2 3 million people diagnosed with diabetes and more than half a million people are unaware they have the condition
3281996 good self management awareness and improved access to specialist diabetes care services are crucial if we are to curb this growing health crisis and see a reduction in the number of people dying from diabetes and complications attributed to the condition
3281997 the number of people in need of our help is rising by the hour
3281998 our hugely popular mini medical school program has played to an overflow crowd each year since its inception in 1999 through our last production in 2006
3281999 now in response to overwhelming public demand we are excited once again to host this highly successful community outreach initiative
3282000 our mini medical school presentations are given by top local experts who are themselves engaged in first class health care delivery and medical research
3282001 for the first time this year we will be incorporating innovative technology that will allow audience members to actively participate in the presentations by providing live feedback and responses to the speakers this is one more way for us to connect with and make medicine real for our community participants

3282009 this is a great day for american airlines american eagle and susan g komen for the cure
3282010 but most of all its a great day for all of us who are deeply determined to end breast cancer forever we sincerely thank the american and american eagle employees at our tulsa and abilene maintenance bases who donated their time to carefully wrap these aircraft in the ribbons seeing these special aircraft take flight today is an inspiration to us all
3282011 this partnership speaks volumes about the quality and longevity of americans commitment to komen and the way the company and its employees share our sense of urgency in discovering and delivering the cures and finding ways to prevent breast cancer
3282012 we are also thrilled that american airlines will be the first corporation to have a direct hand in writing a significant chapter in breast cancer research history with its promise grant
3282013 while tremendous strides have been made in the overall treatment of breast cancer until now theres been very little research into this rare disease that behaves so differently than other breast cancers
3282014 the global cancer community will stand to benefit from our comprehensive research program and what we learn about this disease the only way to achieve better outcomes for women with the disease is to have dedicated resources such as the funds allocated by komen and american airlines for continued ibc research
3282015 the common cold is the main reason why people with asthma get bad attacks
3282016 this research is important because it helps us to understand exactly what happens in our lungs during an asthma attack and it may lead to a way of preventing attacks in future
3282017 water and sewerage prices between 2010 and 2015 need to be set in line with what customers are willing and able to pay and companies should deliver a package of benefits in line with what consumers see as a priority
3282018 many neuroscientists are shocked to learn that cells in the brain have cilia thus it was even more exciting to show that cilia have a key function in regulating the birth of new neurons in the brain
3282019 considering sonic hedgehog is also heavily implicated in brain tumor formation our study places the primary cilium at the crossroads of both regenerative neurobiology and neuro oncology
3282020 a combination of ignorance and corruption has made tobacco control difficult in russia
3282021 most physicians smoke and many non governmental organisations in the health arena mistakenly support the tobacco industrys message that smoking is a free choice

3282091 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

3282097 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3282098 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3282099 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3282100 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3282101 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3282102 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3282103 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3282104 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3282105 why am i feeling so down this is weird and there is no reason i should feel this way
3282106 nice job today you are getting faster keep it up
3282107 hey super star all the hard work has finally paid off you deserve it
3282108 by the way i meant to tell you last night you looked incredibly classy seriously you were radiating not sure what it was but keep it up
3282109 contra el saqueo y la contaminaci n por la soberania alimentaria
3282110 trabajar con ustedes no queremos estar excluidos de su proceso

3282113 ley para la promoci n de la organizaci n de los productores agrarios y la consolidaci n de la propiedad rural para el cr dito agrario
3282114 we do collect suspicious activity we are about to roll out a system where citizens and public officials can report suspicious activities to us
3282115 overzealous intelligence gathering the expansion of uncontrolled access to data on innocent people hostility to open government laws
3282116 watching and recording the everyday activities of an ever growing list of individuals
3282117 our primary concern is that these centers will let local law enforcement to consider any protests to government policies as worthy of investigation
3282118 do we need some oversight over that office some kind of regular report that briefs the legislature
3282119 should this state have some statutory protection for protected first amendment behavior so that it does not lead to spying
3282120 we have a privacy policy in place where we stipulate what we will collect and how we collect that
3282121 if you determine that there are some things that would lead us to believe that joe blow is a terrorist that information could go into a file
3282122 on the flip side if there is no information that would make you believe that there is any connection nothing goes into a file
3282123 the key is it is absolutely critical for any fusion center to have a privacy security policy and that there are checks and balances
3282124 we are absolutely sure we are doing nothing that violates someones civil liberty if only one center is found to be doing what happened in the 1930s and 1940s it will be detrimental to all the centers
3282125 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3282126 this is a promising alternative but needs further testing in randomized trials
3282127 this study again underscores the relatively weak evidence base informing medical care in children compared with adults
3282128 while more empirical evidence is needed to guide clinical practice for children further research such as the study by ryvlin and colleagues is important to inform the design and reporting of pediatric trials standards for the design and reporting of pediatric trials would contribute to the development of a methodologically strong and relevant evidence base for pediatric care
3282129 if you move in before the end of 2008 the law will not affect you at all
3282130 you could have owned many homes in your lifetime as long as you didnt own a home in the three year period prior to the purchase of the home to which the credit will apply
3282131 it was pretty much a jaw dropping response from entertainment people around the world
3282132 everyone was amazed by how it turned out by the scale of it and the quality of it
3282133 we were one of the few companies that made a profit out of it
3282134 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months
3282135 it reinforces the view that the economy will be weak in the next several months and there will be renewed pressure on the fed to start easing again
3282136 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3282137 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken
3282138 when times are tough the herd starts running in the other direction with tougher standards pretty much across the board
3282139 large majorities of domestic respondents reported having tightened their lending standards on prime non traditional and subprime residential mortgages over the previous three months
3282140 it was pretty much a jaw dropping response from entertainment people around the world
3282141 everyone was amazed by how it turned out by the scale of it and the quality of it
3282142 while this was a very difficult decision we feel it was the right thing to do for the future of midway
3282143 we view every game as an investment that must meet certain standards for quality scheduling and profitability
3282144 weve made clear that future acquisitions are likely to be in the logistics arena in asia
3282145 it fits in with the direction the company has discussed with investors
3282146 while this type of deal would expand their international presence europe represents an additional developed market that provides limited growth opportunities
3282147 the key for ups long term success will be to develop a foothold in emerging markets first and foremost is the chinese market in which they are already ramping up operations followed by other areas including india and brazil
3282148 ups already has significantly developed networks of its own in tnts coverage map
3282149 ups has its own highly disciplined and efficient system and i just cant see them absorbing a system on the scale of tnt and thereby having to bring it up to ups standards in a way that would benefit shareholders
3282150 both fedex and ups are quite deliberately building their businesses on a global model which is one of the key reasons why we view them both positively
3282151 again this comes down to shippers trying to keep their margins up in the face of rising fuel costs
3282152 if ups can fully assist the beijing 2008 olympics they can fully assist you
3282153 delta is well positioned to pursue further growth initiatives through strategic acquisitions geographic expansion existing and new customer relationships and additional product and service acquisitions
3282154 this is too little too late and our investigation into morgan stanley continues
3282155 never have we witnessed defendants who created a product that isnt inherently illegal being required to buy back such a large market
3282156 never ending so it is fantastic to win the leg i really had to focus hard on this leg and i realised i could win it 10 miles from the finish and just dug deeper and deeper to get here what is funny is that nico financo wins the first leg and gets the 1st in the overall ranking gildas cercle vert wins the second leg and gets second overall and i win the third leg and take third place overall
3282157 i am really really happy i really had to look for this one i pushed and pushed and pushed never giving up i just had to follow each little wind shift i can tell you that this leg was much harder than it looked the upwind beat was incredibly long and hard i think the hardest in my life psychologically you had to stay on top of things
3282158 it is funny nicolas troussel wins the first leg and is going to win the general gildas morvan wins the second leg and is going to be second and then i win the third and am going to be third overall
3282159 when i reached the livinter plateau well really about 10 miles before the finish line when we lowered the spinnaker just then it was so close and so tough on the whole leg i could see gildas morvan and laurent pellecuer just behind me and they were chasing me down but i kept between them both to mark them so unless something broke i was able to mark them and keep ahead i just kept going to the finish
3282160 yes it did a bit it was a long windward leeward the longest i have ever done playing tactics up to a mark that is 2 miles away i can generally do but then over 300 miles is something else

3282260 we think theres really a place in the market for what we were doing even with diablo iii on the horizon
3282261 this has been a fairly difficult time i think for all of us flagship really felt like family and losing that is very trying
3282262 we were so close to bringing mythos to open beta and shortly thereafter to commercialization that its heartbreaking to know that it wont see the light of day as we intended
3282263 we very much believe in what we were doing with mythos creating a fast paced mmo in the diablo mold that brought together socialization and visceral fun combat
3282264 our testers response was great and we think theres really a place in the market for what we were doing even with diablo iii on the horizon we really want to get there again
3282265 at present were proceeding under the assumption that continuing with mythos wont be possible for us
3282266 there are some enormous obstacles to making that a reality

3282276 the funniest thing you will see this year on stage television or film
3282277 its so instant you get a reaction straight away having spent a lot of time making television recently you hunger for that immediate response
3282278 its great to find out what people think of your material right away rather than months or even years later you can improvise as youre going along which is a real thrill too live work is incredible and when it goes well nothing can beat it
3282279 the only way i can measure it is by the people who come up to us in the street it used to be just cool kids but now its cab drivers and chavs which is great because it means youre appealing to more people
3282280 in the past when i got into taxis the cabbies would always ask who are you now they immediately say the mighty boosh chavs come up to me and say that show is sick it doesnt sound it but apparently thats good

3282286 its never too narrow weve never stopped ourselves doing anything on the boosh
3282287 im sure well do things separately in the future but it really works as a double act

3282325 a os anteriores la municipalidad de puan a trav s del departamento ejecutivo otorg becas de estudio a alumnos del distrito en distintos niveles educativos y que en oportunidades anteriores el concejo deliberante pudo disponer del listado donde se detallaban nombres niveles y valores de los beneficiarios de las mismas
3282326 que ponga en marcha medidas concretas y urgentes para hacer frente a la violencia de g nero e impedir su repetici n y erradicarla por completo
3282327 visto la necesidad de considerar a la violencia contra la mujer como un problema de estado y considerando que una de cada tres mujeres en el mundo ha sido golpeada y obligada a mantener relaciones y sometida a alg n otro tipo de abuso en su vida
3282328 la justificada preocupaci n de los vecinos de darregueira y puan sobre casos de c ncer
3282329 cualquier preocupaci n de la poblaci n sobre temas de salud merece ser tenido muy en cuenta por quienes tienen a cargo el rea de salud
3282330 que la detecci n temprana y el mejor acceso al tratamiento hacen posible a la cura del c ncer en la mayor parte de los casos por eso es de fundamental importancia la difusi n sobre la prevenci n y su tratamiento que hay que ser muy claros y precisos con la poblaci n acerca de los datos reales de al enfermedad en nuestro distrito no para crear una sicosis colectiva sino para que se tome conciencia y se prevenga que no est dem s reconocer la excelente tarea y dedicaci n de m dicos y enfermeras en el acompa amiento de los pacientes que padecen esa enfermedad en los centro de atenci n de nuestro distrito que el no tener a disposici n de la opini n p blica los datos estad sticos concretos y reales genera un clima de suposiciones que no es saludable para la poblaci n que contar con esos datos permitir a que la comunidad se involucre m s con este tema y as pueda trabajar y comprometerse en su prevenci n
3282331 visto la ordenanza 2988 02 sobre patrimonio p blico municipal y considerando que es obligaci n de nuestras autoridades velar por el patrimonio p blico municipal y la protecci n de los sitios donde se han producido hallazgos arqueol gicos antropol gicos y paleontol gicos que dicha ordenanza establece que deben realizarse un relevamiento del patrimonio arqueol gico con su correspondiente inventario y que debe crearse un registro de coleccionistas privados donde quedar n registradas las personas titulares de las colecciones privadas quienes ser n designados por este honorable cuerpo que ser autoridad de la aplicaci n de dicha ordenanza la direcci n de cultura municipal

3282333 si bien el banco provincia cito en la calle del comercio y av san mart n de la municipalidad de puan posee una rampa de acceso para personas discapacitadas o con dificultades motrices puede observarse que en dicho sector no se han construido rampas para tal fin sobre el cord n cuneta de las mencionadas arterias la carencia de dicho servicio m s los sectores destinados a los veh culos del personal del banco y los veh culos de particulares que circulan y estacionan en esa zona dificultan enormemente las posibilidades de acceso de la vereda de la sucursal bancaria a las personas con las mencionadas dificultades que es el estado municipal quien debe ocuparse de erradicar las barreras f sicas que la planta urbana presenta y que obstaculizan el tr nsito de las personas con discapacidades motrices generando las condiciones necesarias para un normal y m s c modo desplazamiento

3282345 the opening ceremony was a long time for the athletes to be on their feet
3282346 if i was a coach in charge of a team with that heat and that amount of standing around i would think that it was a lot
3282347 you dont often do something like that a week or two weeks out from a big event
3282348 no athletes who were competing in the next 48 hours were there but for the others and even for the officials it was a very long time standing
3282349 its things like that we have got to have a good look at
3282350 i can see that when we go back home in september that these things could be missed but i wont forget thats why im here
3282351 im having a really good look at all of this stuff
3282352 i will then make my report back to the boa and all the national governing bodies and uk sport to make sure we learn key lessons
3282353 some really good things have happened that ive been really impressed with

3282357 men of israel listen to this jesus of nazareth was a man accredited by god to you by miracles wonders and signs which god did among you through him as you yourselves know 23 this man was handed over to you by gods set purpose and foreknowledge and you with the help of wicked men put him to death by nailing him to the cross 24 but god raised him from the dead freeing him from the agony of death because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him 25 david said about him i saw the lord always before me because he is at my right hand i will not be shaken 26 therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices my body also will live in hope 27 because you will not abandon me to the grave nor will you let your holy one see decay 28 you have made known to me the paths of life you will fill me with joy in your presence 29 brothers i can tell you confidently that the patriarch david died and was buried and his tomb is here to this day 30 but he was a prophet and knew that god had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne 31 seeing what was ahead he spoke of the resurrection of the christ that he was not abandoned to the grave nor did his body see decay 32 god has raised this jesus to life and we are all witnesses of the fact 33 exalted to the right hand of god he has received from the father the promised holy spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear 34 for david did not ascend to heaven and yet he said the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand 35 until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet 36 therefore let all israel be assured of this god has made this jesus whom you crucified both lord and christ 37 when the people heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and the other apostles brothers what shall we do 38 peter replied repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of you sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit

3282373 from what i have seen and what i have heard and beginning to witness some of the actual security implementation measures i am quite impressed with the level of security in place
3282374 it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3282375 we have got a series of visits that follows from completing the visit to pakistan
3282376 we go to australia and new zealand and speak to the boards as well as the players association and to the players themselves and then visit to england and lets see what comes out
3282377 to convince them is a big challenge and its upon us to convey the message and to raise the confidence based on what we have seen and experienced that the security arrangements in place should be sufficient to have the event safe and secure

3282379 sono le co siddette cheratosi seborroiche lesioni che si formano normal mente nelle zone pi esposte al sole viso tronco testa braccia e gambe o in punti del corpo sot toposti a continuo sfregamento ascelle cosce
3282380 lunica prevenzione quella di ri durre lesposizione al sole spal mando sulla pelle filtri solari molto potenti e poi fare periodicamente una visita dal dermatologo perch se sono ancora molto pic cole si pu rallentarne lo sviluppo spalmando delle creme i cherato litici a base di acido retinoico o acido salicilico che desquamano la pelle questi trattamenti si possono fare tranquillamente a casa
3282381 lo si pu fare utilizzando delle creme a base di acido jaluronico o salicilico o va porizzandole con il laser
3282382 chiaro per che bisogna continuare a curare la cute perch se la cheratosi si formata una volta potrebbe ripresentarsi e la cura consiste nel non esporsi al sole o nel proteggersi molto bene idratarsi e cercare di utilizzare quei cheratolitici che mantengono la pelle pulita

3282399 last year the voters of ohio brought the bill to the legislature through an initiative petition arguing that such ordinances are crucial for the prevention of crime and blight in communities
3282400 the presence of unregulated peep booths porn shops and strip joints presents a host of problems to the community most from the increase in crime in addition to causing urban decay the courts have recognized this once again
3282401 when 75 of the members of the ohio general assembly voted in favor of enacting the reasonable regulations on the hours of operation and prohibiting physical contact between patrons and dancers that leads to prostitution operators of sexually oriented businesses challenged the law in court
3282402 the law also provides significant local control by allowing municipalities and townships to extend local regulations beyond the minimum state industry standards established in the law with the assistance of the attorney generals office
3282403 in october 2007 a federal judge first rejected a request for a temporary restraining order declaring the law constitutional and allowing it to immediately go into effect
3282404 the court finds that the evidence provided by defendants demonstrates that the ohio general assembly after extensive hearings and consideration of plaintiffs arguments enacted the community defense act to minimize the adverse effects of sexually oriented businesses in ohio and benefit its citizens
3282405 this decision will help ensure that communities maintain their ability to protect families and their neighborhoods from these threats
3282406 citizens for community values is the pro family public policy organization that spearheaded the petition drive which brought the voter initiated petition to the ohio legislators they have offices in cincinnati and columbus
3282407 we do expect continued buoyancy in prices across the board although on average these will prove more moderate than has been witnessed over the past few years in short we conclude residential units will offer the most attractive returns this year growing by an average annual rate of 37 per cent to dh2 100 per square foot followed by commercial and retail space which will increase at 23 per cent and 13 per cent respectively to dh3 800 per square foot and dh5 800 per square foot
3282408 despite finding ourselves in an unarguably less benign global economic environment we maintain a bullish outlook for the intermediate term extending over the coming two to three years premising our assertion on robust demographic and economic indicators
3282409 our numbers also suggest a 31 000 residential unit surplus in 2010 it is important to note however that we believe assumption risks prove weighted towards an extension of the undersupply status post 2010 rather the opposite
3282410 with dubai in 2007 reflecting commercial space per capita of 1 5 sqm we conclude a 0 2 sqm per capita shortage equivalent to 1 5m sqm of actual office space going forward demand growth accrues from increases in the addressable labour force with an incremental yearly demand average pertaining to 164 000 sqm leading to a cumulative demand of five million square metres in 2010 equivalent to 2 0sqm capita
3282411 we accordingly conclude that the 62 per cent shortage associated with the 1 5m sqm pent up demand in 2007 will decline dramatically to 15 per cent in 2009 before the market achieves near balance in 2010

3282461 des n gociations s rieuses ont lieu en vue de parvenir un objectif commun
3282462 de 3 miljard mensen die onder de armoedegrens leven vormen een grote markt
3282463 verbinden en vermeerderen zijn de betekenissen van het latijnse woord we brengen particulieren die willen investeren bij elkaar en vermeerderen hun investering
3282464 met de komst van het nieuwe belastingstelsel werd het voor particulieren aantrekkelijker om te investeren in onroerend goed
3282465 annexum koopt die regelt een hypotheek en verhuurt ze particulieren stoppen hun geld in het fonds en profiteren zo van de opbrengsten uit de verhuur en de stijging van de vastgoedwaarde
3282466 zowel in belangstelling als koers is dit fonds onstuimig gegroeid
3282467 de gevolgen van de kredietcrisis merken we ook de waarde van het fonds daalt al vijf kwartalen maar de weg omhoog komt er snel aan
3282468 onze omzet is 0 7 procent van dat bedrag de kosten liggen ook zo rond hetzelfde niveau we verdienen vooral aan het starten van een besloten fonds we krijgen dan een paar procent van het ingelegde vermogen
3282469 hij wijst op de 1 miljard mensen die moeten rondkomen van 1 dollar per dag en op de 2 miljard die niet meer hebben dan 2 dollar je kunt van hen zeggen dat ze zielig zijn maar het is ook een markt van 3 miljard mensen
3282470 uit deze gesprekken bleek dat het doneren van geld alleen niet voldoende is om de problemen in de derde wereld op te lossen ook het verstrekken van leningen is nodig
3282471 grote institutionele beleggers als abp investeren wel in deze vorm van krediet maar zijn niet toegankelijk voor de particulier de asn en triodosbank zijn dat wel maar zij werken vaak vanuit een specifieke ideologie we hebben die ook maar die staat niet in onze missie
3282472 we screenen fondsen bijvoorbeeld op kinderarbeid normen en waarden zijn belangrijk ook in de vastgoedwereld die onder druk staat
3282473 dutch microfund investeert de helft van het geld in leningen en de helft in het eigen vermogen van de instelling het rendement op het fonds is 7 tot 9 procent de helft daarvan keren we uit aan de belegger
3282474 zon 95 procent van de leningen wordt terugbetaald daar mogen nederlandse banken jaloers op zijn het belang van de leningnemers is groot het grootste risico is fraude bij een van de schakels tussen ons en de leningnemer
3282475 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3282476 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3282477 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3282478 we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime
3282479 the united states is a reliable partner in the world
3282480 you cant make the diagnosis theres something else wrong or the test didnt work
3282481 when you take a cell from an embryo the premise of the whole test is that all the cells of the embryo are the same and that is not necessarily the case
3282482 going home with the baby is probably not much better than 1 in 10 00 08 53 and that a number of embryos that could have created healthy tissue matched siblings may be wrongly discarded in the testing process
3282483 all these ethical issues are coming up at this stage but the majority of them are actually predictable earlier and this is where the importance is of actual good counselling right at the very start of this what this might mean if various scenarios need to be played out
3282484 the counselling and permission needs to be obtained right at the beginning of the process before the tissue typing is carried out
3282485 its very understandable that the parents should consider the short term benefits first
3282486 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3282487 people want to have a car that shows off their status in society no one wants to buy small
3282488 the hike in fuel prices last month has done little to damp soaring diesel demand
3282489 the deteriorating economic condition is putting new stress on europe which seems to be even weaker now than the u s
3282490 some pessimists even talk now about the euro area breaking apart i would not go that far but we do know the honeymoon is over and this is the first real test of the marriage that we have seen
3282491 every two to three weeks the prices are going up we are buying less just like everybody else
3282492 we know this isnt going to be easy to bounce back from
3282493 our problem is that we adopted an american model of growth looking to services and construction and quick returns
3282494 it made us more like the united states and less like germany now we see that was a huge mistake
3282495 you have a situation where for example construction companies can make lower bids knowing that they can make up the difference with this cushion thats an unfair competitive advantage to those companies
3282496 at a time when our nation is drowning in debt it is appalling that delinquent businesses have cheated uncle sam
3282497 with the 10 year statute the amount that they are writing off is going up and up this year it is 4 billion in payroll taxes
3282498 but sometimes businesses do make mistakes and down the line
3282499 it does pain me to allow something that has been abused by certain folks to let that go on another year
3282500 in my mind things have been broken for a while and its about time we fixed the problem
3282501 we did a mock battle and there was a camp set up where you could do corn grinding and the crafts they did a thousand years ago
3282502 there was a crime and punishment court scene set up where they re enacted a trial a falcon show and an old viking ship on display
3282503 im obviously very pleased it looked like there was no hope i really thought nothing could be done
3282504 we dont tolerate anti social behaviour and the community shouldnt have to put up with it either
3282505 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability
3282506 there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3282507 with increasing demands on household budgets shoppers are very price conscious and reluctant to spend on big ticket items
3282508 even heavy discounting often failed to tempt customers to buy
3282509 some are shopping more locally for example or buying in season
3282510 an optimized design based on a copper interconnect process and new circuit technology
3282511 his ability to capture the moment was second to none
3282512 win or lose we had a great time every day
3282513 it was obvious back then that they caray and van wieren were bigger than we were
3282514 remarkable talent and a unique wit who had an unbridled joy for the atlanta braves
3282515 his impact on the braves can be characterized so simply braves win braves win braves win
3282516 the key negatives are likely to be cbas relative equity market and general insurance leverage relatively high expense growth and perceptions of relative under provisioning
3282517 we therefore expect a heavy focus on cbas outlook statements and new impaired build up specifically as they relate to core domestic asset quality
3282518 he had a great game and without that i doubt that we win
3282519 it was a lot of dramatics but he does that more subtly all the time on a consistent basis we had some real heroes mcclellan pitched out of a horrific inning young pitcher perez stumbled a bit
3282520 gave him direction at a critical point in the game
3282521 for him to stay strong on that pitch and just say follow me big time
3282522 his instincts are as good as anybodys he had the guts to make that call he got a great feel and he the courage of his convictions
3282523 youve got to be paying attention and ready for anything
3282524 we did a good job as a team at doing a little of everything
3282525 i told yadi im going to trust you i dont know these guys that well im going to trust him 100 percent and he did a little bit of everything big home run calmed down mac then calmed down perez
3282526 escalate the issue to the highest level possible in the government and within his own company
3282527 he did not delete findings from the report and change the draft audit opinion to adequate
3282528 some dcaa supervisors were cutting corners and pressuring their subordinates to give more favorable audits to contractors than the auditors felt the contractors deserved
3282529 this shows a blatant disregard for the safeguards that are supposed to be in place to ensure that contractors charge the government no more than a fair and reasonable price
3282530 will determine what if any of the next appropriate steps will be we have faith in our auditors they are held to high standards
3282531 its an insult to americas workers for the department of labor to be spending its time in the last year of this administration allegedly fine tuning the details of how to do these regulations when other than the one ordered by a court they have issued no major worker health regulations
3282532 the reality is theres a great need to light a fire under this moribund agency to do something anything to protect workers
3282533 the fact that the department of labor seems to be engaged in secret rulemaking makes me highly suspicious that some high level political appointees are up to no good this congress will not stand for the gutting of health and safety protections as the bush administration heads out the door
3282534 people appear to be making assumptions about whats in the draft
3282535 companies tell me we have an immigration system that allows us to hire illegal workers legally
3282536 why are employers not punished more often because the laws we have dont really authorize that
3282537 if you want law enforcement you have to have laws that are enforceable
3282538 has just been chronically flawed from the time it was passed
3282539 je voulais seulement tre rapidement seul devant car je savais que le sud cor en park reviendrait fort dans les 50 derniers m tres
3282540 quand jai vu le temps je pensais que javais commis une erreur jai seulement compris que javais gagn en voyant le n 1 coll mon nom cest un sentiment tr s fort je suis folle de joie
3282541 you see a consensus developing that the current system is unsustainable
3282542 but actually saying what has to happen next is a little bit scary if youre in a campaign especially if some of your most prominent supporters have such deep ties to these entities
3282543 i am hopeful that the extent of carnage will shake up the status quo
3282544 and if the taxpayers end up putting in a significant amount of money which i think they will members of congress will realize whatever their past views were the future cannot be a replay of the past
3282545 there was a general belief that moving forward with a challenge and establishing a precedent in channeling regulation would serve the country better than leaving the challenge to the next administration
3282546 the chief of staffs office then appears to have changed its mind
3282547 today typifies the climate change schizophrenia in the bush administration on one hand government scientists are saying that global warming poses grave threats to our health and our welfare and on the other hand there are white house political hacks following the oil industrys bidding to do nothing
3282548 its going to be hotter its going to be hotter sooner in the year than it was in the past
3282549 theyre going to look back and think back about how nice the summers used to be
3282550 within 20 30 years on average the public should notice that its warmer
3282551 climate change is a serious problem that our nation needs to address but we need to address it correctly
3282552 we were told that the document should not establish a path forward or a framework for regulation but should emphasize the complexity of the challenge
3282553 treize corps et 15 personnes bless es ont t achemin s

3282557 not including motoring convictions not leading to periods of disqualification
3282558 what you will be seeing from now is different before now celtel was operating on continental leverage but from now we operate on global leverage
3282559 all zain customers pre paid in africa and the middle east using one network will enjoy the benefits of being treated as a local customer wherever they are
3282560 we are confide nt that our african customers will embrace the vibrant and colourful zain identity
3282561 as one brand we will be better positioned to offer customers more in novative products and services alongside the best network coverage on the continent
3282562 we are bringing together our african and middle east operations under a single strong and unique identity
3282563 on fait de bonnes affaires au nigeria oui de tr s bonnes affaires
3282564 seul le gouvernement avait le droit dintervenir dans le secteur
3282565 this item was revealed to me by such and such apsara in my meditation
3282566 the body of a dancer of today considerably differs from that of an 11th or 14th century dancer especially one known only from temple sculptures
3282567 there are no contemporary bharatanatyam dancers whose death would result in the immediate death of 1000 of their fans
3282568 i happened to witness a bank run in midland texas one time
3282569 ill never forget the guy standing in the bank lobby saying your deposits are good we got you insured you dont have to worry about it if you got less than 100 000 in the bank the problem was people didnt hear
3282570 my hope is is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our government
3282571 we will come through this challenge stronger than ever before
3282572 i think the system basically is sound i truly do
3282573 and i understand theres a lot of nervousness but the economy is growing productivity is high trade is up people are working its not as good as wed like but to the extent that we find weakness well move
3282574 one front right now is going better than the other and thats iraq where were succeeding and our troops are coming home based upon success
3282575 afghanistan is a tough fight and its really important we succeed there as well as in iraq we do not want the enemy to have safe haven
3282576 i hope that we will look back on this announcement and say this was a very important moment in breaking the back of a lot of market fears
3282577 but its way too early to say that and we must remain vigilant
3282578 the federal government has done what it can to assure that fannie and freddie are too big to fail
3282579 fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder owned companies
3282580 is important to maintaining confidence and stability in our financial system and our financial markets

3282582 nbc is spending more than 1 billion to broadcast the olympic games to the u s they believe footage available on other web sites would take away their audience
3282583 expands to any footage filmed within the accredited area or interviews conducted within the accredited area
3282584 an irish person via a mobile phone and they happened to be in an official olympic car we cannot play that interview outside of ireland
3282585 realistically this means we need to block all live streams radio and television because we cannot monitor all of the streams 24 hours
3282586 its not even common for the olympics no other sporting event in the world requires this level of restrictions including the 2004 games
3282587 were making more of these olympics available to american audiences by far than any olympics in history
3282588 some of the toxic chemicals dumped there are known to cause cancer or other serious health problems
3282589 no entity in the world government or private sector has spent more money or more effort than the defense department has on environmental cleanup cleanup research cleanup assessment technology to conduct cleanup cleanup operations and cleanup follow up monitoring
3282590 no amount of tinkering with the rule or revising of the explanations will transform cair as written into an acceptable rule
3282591 we are extremely disappointed in the courts decision because its overturning one of the most protective air pollution rules in our nations history well wait and see what our next steps are
3282592 this is probably the biggest air quality setback ever suffered by the epa under any administration
3282593 our air isnt getting any healthier as we battle new clean air regulations in the courts and congress continues to stall in passing strong clean air legislation
3282594 it suggested to me that this was going to give us far greater insight into the relationships between individuals fighting against u s forces in the theater and potential u s cells or support networks here in the united states

3282602 reminder to all employees and contractors that irrespective of whether prostitution is legal in the host country employees should not in any way abet sex trafficking or solicit people in prostitution
3282603 employees who engage in this conduct are subject to discipline
3282604 become a central component of u s foreign policy over the last several years
3282605 we discovered that some medical equipment suppliers have scammed the medicare system and the american taxpayers out of massive amounts of money
3282606 using the id numbers of dead doctors these scam artists have treated medicare like an atm machine drawing money out of the governments account with little fear of getting caught
3282607 they should decrease the budget deficit limit spending money and refrain from using oil revenues
3282608 given the government lots of self confidence in many fields
3282609 when you have plenty of money you can solve many problems
3282610 if the price suddenly would drop they will not be able to provide the country with necessary imports the oil money is this governments lifeline
3282611 ignores longstanding scientific ecosystem and watershed protection principles critical to meeting the goals
3282612 this sudden reduction in enforcement activity will undermine the implementation of the clean water act and adversely affect epas responsibility to protect the nations waters
3282613 yet instead of sounding the alarm about epas enforcement problems the agencys public statements have minimized the impact of the rapanos decision
3282614 we will be reviewing the new request and will work with the chairmen to provide information on our enforcement program
3282615 very significant it lays out very clearly why you cant enforce one of the most important parts of the clean water act
3282616 we spent many tens of billions of dollars during the apollo era to purchase a commanding lead in space over all nations on earth
3282617 weve been living off the fruit of that purchase for 40 years and have not chosen to invest at a level that would preserve that commanding lead
3282618 the security situation in these countries is continually deteriorating following the violent fighting that has taken place in south ossetia since august 7
3282619 we have examined the events in georgia and a potential similar scenario to the one in georgia and concluded that such a threat does not exist at this time
3282620 i stand behind the doctors at ivan rilski who have been working to develop new directions in medicine
3282621 if this doesnt work then the customer can usually get better results if they request that they wish to close their account the bank will usually then transfer the call to a retention unit which will close the account if the customer insists but will often play lets make a deal to keep their business
3282622 mid to high risk customers are on a very short leash
3282623 if you do anything that even hints at being indicative of risk theyre going to do something nasty to you
3282624 if you have the ability or you have excellent credit scores and are not in a lot of debt now may be a time to open up one or two cards so you have other options
3282625 if not in a literal sense then a figurative sense
3282626 from a policy perspective the question becomes do you want to keep these towns active
3282627 if you see an out migration driven by accelerating economic decline which is possible then what you may be having is people staying in these areas just because they dont want to leave and having to piece together work
3282628 at the last three home football games last year there were over 1 000 people

3282653 birds cause some considerable problem in forms of noise and dirt not only do their droppings damage and contaminate property the birds also carry various diseases such as salmonella
3282654 if they are encouraged into an area and build nests these nests can cause problems such as blocking chimneys flues and gutters food put out for the birds will also attract rats and vermin if we establish that a nuisance or pest problem does exist we may have to consider further action

3282671 theres an appraisal done on the house and then the bank can lend and is insured up to 90 percent of that value
3282672 so what the lender has to do for that kind of insured loan that they would offer to the borrower is eat the difference between whatever the original loan was written at and the current value
3282673 there are people that are not going to fit there are lenders that are not going to take it up and there are borrowers for whom it wont be option that actually works for them

3282704 strategies to achieve quality health services and protect health workers
3282705 psi is renewing its call to governments to do more than pay lip service to international instruments on human rights and labour standards and to take urgent steps to guarantee the exercise of trade union rights and the safety of trade unionists psi joins trade unions across the globe in calling for an end to exploitation for safe working conditions for respect for the dignity of workers and for respect for the right of workers everywhere to form trade unions and to bargain collectively for their pay and conditions too many public service workers are still denied the right to organise and to bargain collectively with their employer strong public services depend on workers who are treated decently at work and are able to freely exercise the rights given to them by international instruments without strong quality public services it is impossible to achieve a more just and equitable society where discrimination poverty and hunger become things of the past
3282706 the use of such disproportionate force to prevent citizens exercising their lawful human rights is clearly unacceptable turkey has aspirations of joining the european union yet continues to flout the very principles upon which the eu was founded in the most outrageous way if turkey expects to join the eu it must demonstrate its commitment to democracy and the observance of human rights including the rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly
3282707 satawu has very good reasons for offloading the ship we understand their objection police cannot be used as scab labour
3282708 we are of the view they should not offload this ship
3282709 trade unionists in zimbabwe are being persecuted and civil servants have been arrested for
3282710 we are very pleased with the solidarity being extended to north carolina public employees by unions from across the three nafta countries and around the globe this shows that north carolinas continued denial of basic worker rights is an international disgrace its an injustice and an embarrassment to this state that our elected officials must correct
3282711 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3282712 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3282713 i wish more private initiatives come up with corporate support apart from the backing of the government
3282714 with our depth of talent and expanse of people i firmly believe india can be a world class sporting power
3282715 they have all been telling me what a huge achievement winning gold is i realise that but frankly the enormity of the goodwill generated has caught me by surprise
3282716 we know that globalisation has a disproportionate impact on women structural adjustment policies promoted by the international financial institutions have led to privatisation of vital public services which has pushed many women into the informal economy and into even more unpaid unregulated and unrecognised work
3282717 we know that quality public services including water sanitation housing and health care are essential to alleviating poverty and to achieving gender equality around the world women continue to have the main responsibility for caring for children the sick and the elderly lack of basic services constrains their entry to and ability to fully participate in paid employment
3282718 thank you chairperson for the opportunity on behalf of education international psi and ituc to address this plenary session
3282719 the next world water forum will be held in istanbul in 2009 and we are extremely excited to be working one year ahead with turkish unions engineers and ngos public water here is under the threat of outright privatisation we call on the turkish government to halt its inappropriate privatisation policies and we send a particular message to the governments of canada and the usa stop blocking un efforts to declare water as a human right
3282720 despite the reluctance of governments to engage in such major public works projects this particular public investment has huge paybacks in terms of health education and social and economic growth we call on governments to dedicate the necessary resources including for urban slums to help create jobs and to lift people out of poverty and degradation this may well be the most important investment a government can make this new paper brings a number of new facts to policymakers attention and we will support our union affiliates in their advocacy for quality public sanitation systems

3282724 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3282725 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3282726 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3282727 die deutsche telekom wird bei breitband und festnetzdiensten marktanteile verlieren w hrend die kabelbetreiber profitieren werden
3282728 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3282729 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3282730 from the information at its disposal the committee can only conclude that the transfers of the five trade union members were related to their membership in the trade union
3282731 the committee recalls that acts of anti union discrimination should cover not only hiring and dismissal but also any discriminatory measures during employment in particular transfers downgrading and other acts that are prejudicial to the workers
3282732 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3282733 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3282734 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3282917 and i believe this will be a cornerstone in online gaming economy thinking
3282918 i first read it online and was turned on that i went out and bought the book now im a true fan of online gaming economy studies and research i find the subject to be extremely interesting and thought provoking and reminiscent of the free thought era in the late 60s and early 70s
3282919 the highest usage areas in our library now are the public computers with internet access although most of the time the crowd is younger and usually communicating with friends some older notable online gaming economy researchers will come in and go straight for internet completely ignoring the card catalog
3282920 im happy to see that young people are interested in our online gaming economy studies
3282921 the internet has piqued the interest of our youth and has given them unparalled access to all knowledge academic and secular
3282922 i like the internet because it is very transparent and available to all
3282923 but at the same time there is no authoritave body that can assign some sort of approval rating to truly legitimate works and those spun by unqualified authors
3282924 when i published my work it would take a couple years to circulate the academic community and public now with the internet i can write and publish instantly casual readers and researchers alike can review my work as i write it
3282925 without the awesome online gaming economy studies of anaya lugardo this area would never have reached popular society now we can truly dig out the truths and realities of the online gaming economy world around us and develop more reliable and sound conclusions thousands of heads are better than a few

3282934 de rode kaart tweemaal geel voor laatste stop bij inter moengotapoe august adjoeba met nog ruim een kwartier in de eerste helft heeft ook geen noemenswaardig voordeel opgebracht voor de landskampioen
3282935 in de defensie van inter zijn slordige fouten gemaakt die fataal zijn geworden august adjoeba de niets ontziende verdediger van inter was niet in zijn normale doen hij greep te langzaam in en maakte een onzekere indruk toch was hij de held toen hij na zeven minuten de gelijkmaker uit een scrimmage scoorde
3282936 het leder was hem ontglipt na een harde kopstoot van august segebai adjoeba
3282937 in de laatste vijf minuten van de partij had brunswijk zijn invalbeurt het waren de vijf gezelligste minuten waarbij de clubeigenaar met zijn vele valpartijen meer op een turner dan een voetballer leek
3282938 dego fans beschuldigden hun eigen spelers ervan de wedstrijd verkocht te hebben omdat eigenaar adjoeba zich niet aan bepaalde financi le afspraken met de spelers zou hebben gehouden
3282939 vooral august adjoeba stond in de achterhoede als sluitpost en ruimde alles op wat maar in zijn buurt bewoog
3282940 of august adjoeba zorgde indien nodig krachtig voor orde in de inter verdediging gezien het feit dat het onnodig lang duurde voordat geblesseerde inter spelers op de been kwamen liet budel tot ongenoegen van ronny brunswijk en de inter aanhang nog vijf minuten langer spelen voordat hij affloot

3283111 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3283112 we have decided to support the impeachment motion in the interest of the democracy
3283113 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
3283114 white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush tahir jalil habbush the director of the mukhabarat to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
3283115 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
3283116 i understand that there are some people who wish to bury any new facts concerning the subject of wmd in iraq they are ready to liquidate any person or group who ventures into this subject
3283117 are not ready to give interviews because that endangers their life it would endanger your life as well i am serious in my warning
3283118 nobody can guarantee your life nor the fate of the material you will be collecting in baghdad
3283119 i request that you adjourn your scheduled trip to baghdad

3283121 without such information an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
3283122 irans decision to disperse and keep secret several of its key sites further hinders the development of a full picture of its centrifuge complex
3283123 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
3283124 an emphasis on military responses to this conflict has the effect of discouraging iran from allowing more effective iaea inspections something necessary for the successful conclusion of a diplomatic solution to irans nuclear program
3283125 iran is understandably concerned that more transparency on its part could lead to the us and israeli militaries gaining better targeting information on its nuclear program
3283126 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
3283127 could prompt iran to hasten its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons by embarking on a crash programme
3283128 iran could then build a small centrifuge plant at a secret location capable of producing weapons grade uranium for one or two nuclear weapons per year
3283129 to finance the reconstruction of the facility and continue the current programme without major budgetary consequences
3283130 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew park was going to have a good last 50 meters so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150 meters

3283144 die rfid diebstahlsicherung meldet nicht nur dass ein produkt gestohlen wurde sondern auch welches und wann mit dieser information kann besonderes augenmerk auf diebstahlgef hrdete produktgruppen und zeiten gelegt werden
3283145 der einsatz war bisher noch schwierig da traditionelle uhf rfid gates ein schwer eingrenzbares lesefeld hatten was oft zu unerw nschten fehlalarmen f hrte

3283150 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3283151 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3283152 im not sure that obama will actually pursue the same kind of idea that we had inserted in the platform
3283153 i think we will have to pursue our congressional representatives to bring legislation forward
3283154 to say youre going to provide affordable coverage to people is not the same as giving them health care
3283155 just because you have insurance coverage does not guarantee you access to the care that you and your doctor decide you need and people with insurance understand that
3283156 ensuring that americans have access to affordable high quality health care
3283157 for 50 years the democratic party has been engaged in a battle to provide the kind of health care a great nation owes its people
3283158 we believe that health care is a right and not a privilege
3283159 enfatiza la necesidad urgente de que todas las partes se abstengan de seguir empleando la fuerza
3283160 russias aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states
3283161 the implications go beyond their threat to a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbours such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west
3283162 all the mawassi people used to work in the settlements and make good money now there is nothing to do even our own agricultural land is barren
3283163 i have no fuel now for my car where can i go freedom is a slogan even for a donkey you need money which i dont have
3283164 we are all now unemployed and depend on charity for food
3283165 my sons were farmers in the greenhouses we worked in the settlements and had resources now i dont think i could survive without the un before was better
3283166 working is not everything the checkpoints made our city a prison we cant say the occupation days were better than today
3283167 neither hamas nor fatah knocked on the doors to ask what we need people are fed up we have become beggars
3283168 i just saw a warlock go from level 31 59 in 10 seconds in front of my eyes the new recruit a friend is bull gt lt nerf nerf nerf
3283169 theoretically someone with two recruited characters could level a brand new character from 1 to 59 in minutes
3283170 he put himself under a lot of pressure and was very tense
3283171 otherwise he could have played better as was the case in the second set after he had calmed down and taken some water during the break the crowd was very huge and added to the pressure yet if he had constructed his points better he would have benefited from a lot of support from the japan fans who dont like the koreans
3283172 im gegenteil der innovationsfreude schadet ein totales wild west milieu
3283173 wir haben es immer wieder erlebt wenn das vertrauen der menschen einmal verloren gegangen ist ist es enorm schwer es wiederherzustellen
3283174 sie wurden nicht genug berwacht um die steuerzahler davor zu bewahren dass diese institute mit dem geld der amerikanischen b rger bertriebene risiken eingehen
3283175 no dont do it youre an idiot theyll get you stoned and stick it up your pooper

3283180 ongoing negotiations are serious and difficult this does not indicate a possibility of reaching agreement on any final status issue
3283181 if israel will not support our choice of an independent palestinian state in the occupied territories including east jerusalem then the alternative demand of the palestinian people and leadership will be a bi national state
3283182 o estudo tem uma mensagem que incentiva o exerc cio se voc precisa escolher uma coisa para fazer as pessoas ficarem mais saud veis enquanto envelhecem seria o exerc cio aer bico
3283183 o exerc cio ajuda os idosos a continuarem m veis e independentes garante a sa de card aca mant m o peso e os n veis de estresse sob controle e ajuda a melhorar o sono

3283185 the trade and industry ministry and treasury warned me that importing those books is illegal
3283186 a proposal put by the defense ministry to build a permanent settlement of migron nearby
3283187 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3283188 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3283189 wir wissen dass viele kunden auch au erhalb der usa daran interessiert sind den kindle zu kaufen und dementsprechend wollen wir den kindle auch in anderen l ndern zur verf gung stellen

3283191 wir sehen den kindle als einen versuch das buch zu verbessern auch wenn es fast 500 jahre lang nderungen widerstanden hat
3283192 it may well lead to public outrage as robots will have access to integrated databases of all information of citizens similar systems were closed due to public outrage and breach of liberty privacy laws and human rights
3283193 these robot developments could be extremely beneficial in the protection of citizens and police in the hands of benevolent governments
3283194 but in the wrong hands robot law enforcement could be a major blow to individual privacy and basic human rights
3283195 oooh lets include the word router and base my song off it
3283196 well do it with the intent of having the least negative impact on the client
3283197 you can never get enough of what you dont really need
3283198 in this telephone conversation they voiced their satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and in subsequent contact they described the trend of these negotiations as constructive
3283199 nothing has changed we stick to the two track approach the channels of communication remain open
3283200 on the one side pressure for sanctions in the but also the offer of dialogue for the iranians to come to the table to discuss the package of incentives which has been proposed to them
3283201 if they come out and have their hands high theyve then got to move them to get those low ones
3283202 quite often their hands will come down to mid range then theyve got to go up so if you flick it hard enough its a longer process to go down and up
3283203 i wanted to make sure i had got it right luckily i did have it right
3283204 the third goal last night was one we havent used before it was one we knew we could use against a team that was trying to charge me down and get out there quite quick
3283205 it was the one we wanted to get out early in the tournament that will probably stop teams or make them think about how fast they run out they cant over commit to me because weve got all these other options
3283206 its something like between 15 and 20 so weve got lots of options that we can use at penalty corner time
3283207 theyre all very simple just little changes really weve got different variations that we can use against each team which is probably why we have got so many
3283208 what i love about it is if i put a good flick and it goes where i want it to go and the keeper saves it then ive done my part
3283209 im not that worried about youve got to give your opposition a bit of credit they might get lucky sometimes
3283210 and from the cast of experts invited and the contents of their presentations it seemed to have been an exciting 2 day event in bogota colombia
3283211 ich habe die entscheidung trotzdem getroffen da die wirtschaftsf hrer schwierigkeiten bei reisen ins ausland haben was sie davon abh lt neu zu investieren
3283212 f r mich sieht es so aus als ob die zeit der schuldzuweisungen begonnen hat
3283213 das war das h rteste rennen meiner karriere ich musste sofort alles geben und am ende tat es richtig weh aber es hat sehr viel spa gemacht
3283214 paul hat sich intensiv auf olympia vorbereitet und viel gequ lt das hat sich hier ausgezahlt
3283215 mein ziel war es m glichst schnell f r eine entscheidung zu sorgen das hat wunderbar geklappt
3283216 it wasnt outside my realm of capability to sneak in on a really good day
3283217 but its a specialist event and id sort of put all of my eggs into the training basket of the other event
3283218 its just a rhythm you get into its bang bang bang bang if you cant shoot to that rhythm its just a bit harder
3283219 the others are professionals they shoot 60 000 targets a year training thats the thing all the other people in the room here dont do anything else
3283220 der panzer ist keine bedrohung er ist lediglich zum schutz des pressezentrums gedacht
3283221 chinas milit r ist in der lage jeden terroristischen anschlag w hrend der spiele abzuwehren
3283222 jihad and the rifle alone no negotiations no conferences and no dialogues
3283223 one hour spent fighting in the path of allah is worth more than seventy years spent in praying at home
3283224 go forth light and heavy and strive with your selves and your wealth in the path of allah that is better for you if only you knew
3283225 never shall i leave the land of jihad except in three circumstances either i shall be killed in afghanistan either i shall be killed in peshawar or either i shall be handcuffed and expelled from pakistan
3283226 i feel that i am nine years old seven and a half years in the afghan jihad one and a half years in the jihad in palestine and the rest of the years have no value
3283227 jihad must not be abandoned until allah swt alone is worshipped jihad continues until allahs word is raised high jihad until all the oppressed peoples are freed jihad to protect our dignity and restore our occupied lands jihad is the way of everlasting glory
3283228 proclaim openly that which you were commanded and turn away from the polytheists mushrikeen
3283229 muslims cannot be defeated by others we muslims are not defeated by our enemies but instead we are defeated by our own selves
3283230 those on whom is the grace of allah the prophets the sincere ones the martyrs and the righteous the best of company are they
3283231 indeed islamic history is not written except with the blood of the shuhadaa
3283232 they seek to extinguish the light of allah by their mouths but allah refuses save to perfect his light even if the disbelievers are averse it is he who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the true religion in order that he may make it prevail over all religions even if the pagans are averse
3283233 allah has bought from the believers their selves and their wealth in return for them having the garden they fight in the way of allah and they kill and are killed it is a promise binding on him in the torah the injil and the quran and who is truer to his contract than allah rejoice then in the bargain you have made that is the great victory those who turn in repentance those who worship those who praise those who fast those who bow those who prostrate those who command the right those who forbid the wrong those who preserve the limits of allah give good news to the believers
3283234 i asked the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace messenger of allah which action is best he replied the prayer at its proper time i asked then what he answered then devotion to parents i asked then what he said jihad in the way of allah then i was silent and stopped asking the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace but if i had asked for more he would have told me more
3283235 there is no hijra after the conquest of makka but there is jihad and intention when you are called upon to fight then go forth
3283236 messenger of allah we see that jihad is the best action so should we not do jihad
3283237 a man came to the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace and said direct me to an action which is equal to
3283238 good deeds are written for the one going on jihad for the steps his horse takes while grazing tied by its rope
3283239 o you who believe shall i direct you to a transaction which will save you from a painful punishment that you believe in allah and his messenger and do jihad in the way of allah with your wealth and yourselves that is better for you if you only knew he will forgive you your wrong actions and admit you into gardens with rivers flowing under them and fine dwellings in the gardens of eden that is the great victory
3283240 it was asked messenger of allah who is the best of people
3283241 the likeness of someone who does jihad in the way of allah and allah knows best the one who does jihad in his way is like someone who fasts and prays constantly and allah guarantees for the one who does jihad in his way that if he dies he will admit him into the garden or else he will either return whole with reward or booty
3283242 o allah provide me with martyrdom in the land of your messenger
3283243 the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace used to visit umm haram bint milhan and she would feed him
3283244 some people from my community who were shown me raiding in the way of allah riding the middle of this sea like kings on throne
3283245 messenger of allah ask allah to put me among them
3283246 some people from my community who were shown me raiding in the way of allah
3283247 messenger of allah ask allah to put me among them
3283248 if someone believes in allah and his messenger and establishes the prayer and fasts ramadan it is mandatory for allah to admit him to the garden whether he does jihad in the way of allah or sits in the land where he was born
3283249 messenger of allah shall we give the people the good news
3283250 in the garden there are a hundred degrees which allah has prepared for those who do jihad in the way of allah between each two degrees is the space between heaven and earth when you ask allah ask him for firdaws which is in the middle of the garden and the top of the garden
3283251 above the throne of the all merciful and from it spring the rivers of the garden
3283252 i dreamt in the night that two men came to me and climbed the tree and admitted me into the most beautiful and excellent house and i have never seen any more beautiful than it
3283253 a morning spent in the way of allah or an evening is better than this world and everything it contains
3283254 a bows length of the garden is better than everything on which the sun rises and sets
3283255 a morning or evening in the way of allah is better than that on which the sun rises and sets
3283256 a morning or an evening spent in the way of allah is better than this world and everything it contains
3283257 there is no one who has died and found good with allah who would be happy to return to this world even if he were to have this world and what is in it except for the martyr when he sees the virtue of martyrdom he would be happy to return to his world and be killed again
3283258 an evening spent in the way of allah or an morning is better than this world and everything it contains the amount of a bows length of one of you in the garden or the place of his lash i e his whip is better than this world and what is contains if a woman of the people of the garden were to appear to the people of the earth she would illuminate what is between the heaven and the earth and will it with fragrance the scarf on her head is better than this world and what is contains
3283259 i heard the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace say by the one in whose hand my soul is if it were not that there are men among the believers who would not be happy to stay behind me and i have not got the wherewithal to provide them with mounts i would never stay behind from any expedition in the way of allah by the one in whose hand my soul is i would love to be killed in the way of allah and then be brought to life and then be killed and then be brought to life and then be killed and then brought to life and then be killed again
3283260 the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace gave a speech and said
3283261 or he said it would not make them happy to be with us and his eyes were weeping
3283262 if anyone leaves his home emigrating to allah and his messenger and death catches up with him it is allah who will reward him
3283263 the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace went to sleep one day when he was near me and then woke up smiling
3283264 the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace sent some seventy men from the banu sulaym to the banu amir
3283265 are you anything but a finger that is injured and what you have met is in the cause of allah
3283266 by the one who has my soul in his hand anyone who is wounded in the way of allah and allah knows best the one who is wounded in his way will come on the day of rising with his wound bleeding it will be the colour of blood but have the scent of musk
3283267 what do you await for us except for one of the two best things
3283268 i asked you how your fight against him went and you claimed that the war had its ups and downs and success alternated that is how the messengers are tested and then they have the final victory
3283269 among the believers there are men who have been true to the contract they made with allah some of them have fulfilled their pact by death and some are still waiting to do so and have not changed in any way at all
3283270 my uncle anas ibn an nadr missed the fighting at badr and said messenger of allah i missed the first battle in which you fought the idolaters
3283271 we found him with about eighty wounds sword thrusts or spear stabs or arrows we found that he had been killed and the idolaters had mutiliated him no one could recognise him except for his sister by his fingertips
3283272 his sister who was called ar rubayyi broke a girls tooth and the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace commaned retaliation
3283273 i copied out the papers into the pages and i missed one
3283274 o you who believe why do you say what you do not do it is abhorrent to allah that you should say what you do not do allah loves those who fight in his way in ranks like well built walls
3283275 a man bristling with armour came to the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace and said messenger of allah shall i fight or become muslim
3283276 o prophet of allah will you not tell me about haritha
3283277 if he is in the garden i will be patient if the case is other than that i will weep my eyes out for him
3283278 umm haritha there are many gardens within the garden and your son has obtained the highest paradise
3283279 a man came to the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace and said one man fights for booty and one man fights for renown and another fights so that his position will be seen
3283280 it was not for people of madina and the desert arabs around them to remain behind the messenger of allah nor to prefer themselves to him that is because no thirst or weariness or hunger will afflict them in the way of allah nor will they take a single step to infuriate the rejectors nor secure any gain from the enemy without a right action being written down for them because of it allah does not let the wage of the good doers go to waste
3283281 the fire will not touch anyone whose feet become dusty in the way of allah
3283282 go to abu said and listen to some of his
3283283 the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace went out to them
3283284 do not suppose that those killed in the way of allah are dead
3283285 the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace cursed those who killed the people at bir mauna for thirty morning against ril dhakwan and usayya who had disobeyed allah and his messenger
3283286 some people drank wine in the morning of the battle of uhud and then were killed as martyrs
3283287 my father was brought to the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace and he had been mutilated
3283288 no one will enter the garden and then want to return to this world even if he had everything that is on the earth except for a martyr who wants to return to this world and be killed ten times more because of the honour he experiences
3283289 our prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace reported to us from the message of our lord whoever of us is killed will go to the garden
3283290 are not those of us killed in the garden and those of them killed in the fire
3283291 abdullah ibn abi awfa wrote to us that the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace had said know that the garden is under the shadow of the swords
3283292 sulayman son of daud peace be upon them both said i will go around tonight to a hundred or ninety nine wives and each of them will produce a warrior who will fight in the way of allah
3283293 the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace was the best of people the bravest of people and the most generous of people
3283294 give me my cloak if i had had camels as numerous as these trees i would have divided them between you and then you will not find me to be a miser a liar nor a coward
3283295 sad used to teach his sons these words as a teacher would teach boys to write
3283296 o allah i seek refuge with you from incapacity and laziness cowardice and senility i seek refuge with you from the trial of life and death and i seek refuge with you from the punishment of the grave

3283473 abdullah ibn abi awfa wrote to us and i read it during one of his battles in which the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace participated he waited until the sun declined and then stood up to address the people and said
3283474 o allah sender down of the book and mover of the clouds and vanquisher of the companies defeat them and help us against them
3283475 the believers are those who believe in allah and his messenger and who when they are with him on a matter of common concern do not leave until they have asked him for permission those people who do ask you for permission are the ones who truly believe in allah and his messenger if they ask your permission to attend to their own affairs give permission to any of them you please and ask allahs forgiveness for them allah is ever forgiving most merciful

3283485 some people took some of this money for doing jihad and then they do not do jihad if someone does that we are more entitled to that money so that we can reclaim from him what he took
3283486 when you are paid something to spend in the way of allah then do what you like and place it with your family
3283487 i provided a horse in the way of allah and then i saw it being sold i asked the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace and he said do not buy it do not take back your

3283499 i prepared the journey provisions for the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace in abu bakrs house when he wanted to emigrate to madina
3283500 i did not find anything with which to tie the food for the journey or the water skin so i said to abu bakr by allah i do not find anything with which to tie it except my belt
3283501 in the time of the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace we used to take provision to madina from the meat of the sacrifices
3283502 we chewed ate and drank then the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace got up and rinsed out his mouth and we rinsed our mouths and then we prayed
3283503 the provisions of the people were reduced and they were in want
3283504 three hundred of us went out and i was one of them carrying our provisions on our shoulders our provisions were exhausted until a man among us would eat one date every day
3283505 abu abdullah how can a single date satisfy a man
3283506 we felt its absence when it was finished until we reached the sea and there was a fish that the sea had cast up we ate what we wanted of it for eighteen days

3283512 the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace reached khaybar in the morning and they had come out with their spades on their shoulders when they saw him they said this is muhammad and the army muhammad and the army they took refuge in their fortress the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace raised his hands and said allah is greater khaybar is ruined when we alight in the courtyard of a people it is an evil morning for those who have been warned we found some donkeys and cooked them then the announcer of the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace announced allah and his messenger have forbidden you the meat of donkeys so the pots were overturned with what was in them
3283513 the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace raised his hands
3283514 when we went up we said allah is great and when we went down we said glory be to allah

3283522 i was with abdullah ibn umar on the makka road when news reached him that safiyya bint abi ubayd was severely ill he travelled quicker until it was after the twilight has set and then he alighted and prayed
3283523 travelling is a form of punishment it deprives a person of his food and drink and sleep when he finishes what he has to do he should hurry back to his family
3283524 do not buy it do not take back your sadaqa
3283525 i gave away a mount a horse in the way of allah and the person who had it sold it or did not look after it properly i wanted to buy it back and thought that he would sell it cheaply i asked the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace and he said do not buy it nor take back your

3283659 gov paterson has every confidence the port authority will address this in a way that is fair to its employees and the taxpayers of new york and new jersey
3283660 its not our policy to allow it for personal use
3283661 they attract nuisances such as the homeless public urination and graffiti
3283662 to offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times
3283663 there is no hijra i e migration from mecca to medina after the conquest of mecca but jihad and good intention remain and if you are called by the muslim ruler for fighting go forth immediately
3283664 o allahs apostle we consider jihad as the best deed should we not fight in allahs cause
3283665 the best jihad for women is hajj mabrur i e hajj which is done according to the prophets tradition and is accepted by allah
3283666 instruct me as to such a deed as equals jihad in reward
3283667 can you while the muslim fighter is in the battle field enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break your fast
3283668 the mujahid i e muslim fighter is rewarded even for the footsteps of his horse while it wanders bout for grazing tied in a long rope
3283669 o allahs apostle who is the best among the people
3283670 a believer who strives his utmost in allahs cause with his life and property
3283671 a believer who stays in one of the mountain paths worshipping allah and leaving the people secure from his mischief
3283672 the example of a mujahid in allahs cause and allah knows better who really strives in his cause is like a person who fasts and prays continuously allah guarantees that he will admit the mujahid in his cause into paradise if he is killed otherwise he will return him to his home safely with rewards and war booty
3283673 some of my followers who in a dream were presented before me as fighters in allahs cause on board a ship amidst this sea cause me to smile they were as kings on the thrones or like kings on the thrones
3283674 some of my followers were presented to me as fighters in allahs cause
3283675 o allahs apostle invoke allah that he makes me one of them
3283676 whoever believes in allah and his apostle offer prayer perfectly and fasts the month of ramadan will rightfully be granted paradise by allah no matter whether he fights in allahs cause or remains in the land where he is born
3283677 o allahs apostle shall we acquaint the people with the is good news
3283678 paradise has one hundred grades which allah has reserved for the mujahidin who fight in his cause and the distance between each of two grades is like the distance between the heaven and the earth so when you ask allah for something ask for al firdaus which is the best and highest part of paradise
3283679 last night two men came to me in a dream and made me ascend a tree and then admitted me into a better and superior house better of which i have never seen one of them said this house is the house of martyrs
3283680 a single endeavor of fighting in allahs cause in the forenoon or in the afternoon is better than the world and whatever is in it
3283681 a place in paradise as small as a bow is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets i e all the world
3283682 a single endeavor in allahs cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets
3283683 a single endeavor in allahs cause in the afternoon and in the forenoon is better than the world and whatever is in it
3283684 nobody who dies and finds good from allah in the hereafter would wish to come back to this world even if he were given the whole world and whatever is in it except the martyr who on seeing the superiority of martyrdom would like to come back to the world and get killed again in allahs cause
3283685 a single endeavor of fighting in allahs cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all the world and whatever is in it a place in paradise as small as the bow or lash of one of you is better than all the world and whatever is in it and if a houri from paradise appeared to the people of the earth she would fill the space between heaven and the earth with light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever is in it
3283686 zaid took the flag and was martyred and then jafar took the flag and was martyred and then abdullah bin rawaha took the flag and was martyred too and then khalid bin al walid took the flag though he was not appointed as a commander and allah made him victorious
3283687 it would not please us to have them with us
3283688 or the prophet shedding tears said it would not p ease them to be with us
3283689 once the prophet slept in my house near to me and got up smiling i said what makes you smile he replied some of my followers who i e in a dream were presented to me sailing on this green sea like kings on thrones i said o allahs apostle invoke allah to make me one of them
3283690 i will go ahead of you and if they allow me to convey the message of allahs apostle it will be all right otherwise you will remain close to me
3283691 allah is greater by the lord of the kaba i am successful
3283692 inform our people that we have met our lord he is pleased with us and he has made us pleased
3283693 you are just a finger that bled and what you got is in allahs cause
3283694 by him in whose hands my soul is whoever is wounded in allahs cause and allah knows well who gets wounded in his cause will come on the day of resurrection with his wound having the color of blood but the scent of musk
3283695 i asked you about the outcome of your battles with him i e the prophet and you told me that you fought each other with alternate success so the apostles are tested in this way but the ultimate victory is always theirs
3283696 o allahs apostle i was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans by allah if allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans no doubt allah will see how bravely i will fight
3283697 o allah i apologize to you for what these i e his companions have done and i denounce what these i e the pagans have done
3283698 o sad bin muadh by the lord of an nadr paradise i am smelling its aroma coming from before the mountain of uhud
3283699 o allahs apostle i cannot achieve or do what he i e anas bin an nadr did we found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body we found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognize him by his fingers
3283700 among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with allah
3283701 o allahs apostle by him who has sent you with the truth my sisters tooth shall not be broken
3283702 there are some people amongst allahs slaves whose oaths are fulfilled by allah when they take them
3283703 when the quran was compiled from various written manuscripts one of the verses of surat al ahzab was missing which i used to hear allahs apostle reciting
3283704 among the believers are men who have been true to what they covenanted with allah
3283705 he did very little after embracing islam but he will be rewarded in abundance
3283706 if he is in paradise i will be patient otherwise i will weep bitterly for him
3283707 o mother of hartha there are gardens in paradise and your son got the firdausal ala i e the best place in paradise
3283708 a man fights for war booty another fights for fame and a third fights for showing off which of them fights in allahs cause
3283709 he who fights that allahs word i e islam should be superior fights in allahs cause
3283710 during the construction of the mosque of the prophet we carried the adobe of the mosque one brick at a time while ammar used to carry two at a time
3283711 may allah be merciful to ammar he will be killed by a rebellious aggressive group ammar will invite them to obey allah and they will invite him to the hell fire
3283712 you have put down your arms by allah i have not put down my arms yet
3283713 inform our people that we have met our lord he is pleased with us and he has made us pleased
3283714 some people drank alcohol in the morning of the day of the battle of uhud and were martyred on the same day
3283715 were they martyred in the last part of the day
3283716 do not cry for the angels are still shading him with their wings
3283717 does the narration include the expression till he was lifted
3283718 nobody who enters paradise likes to go back to the world even if he got everything on the earth except a mujahid who wishes to return to the world so that he may be martyred ten times because of the dignity he receives from allah
3283719 is it not true that our men who are killed will go to paradise and theirs i e those of the pagans will go to the hell fire
3283720 once solomon son of david said by allah tonight i will have sexual intercourse with one hundred or ninety nine women each of whom will give birth to a knight who will fight in allahs cause
3283721 allah willing he would have begotten sons all of whom would have been knights striving in allahs cause
3283722 give me my cloak if i had as many camels as these thorny trees i would have distributed them amongst you and you will not find me a miser or a liar or a coward
3283723 o allah i seek refuge with you from helplessness laziness cowardice and feeble old age i seek refuge with you from afflictions of life and death and seek refuge with you from the punishment in the grave
3283724 there is no emigration after the conquest but jihad and intentions when you are called by the muslim ruler for fighting go forth immediately
3283725 allah welcomes two men with a smile one of whom kills the other and both of them enter paradise one fights in allahs cause and gets killed later on allah forgives the killer who also get martyred in allahs cause
3283726 o allahs apostle give me a share from the land of khaibar
3283727 strange a wabr i e guinea pig who has come down to us from the mountain of qaduim i e grazing place of sheep blames me for killing a muslim who was given superiority by allah because of me and allah did not disgrace me at his hands i e was not killed as an infidel
3283728 i do not know whether the prophet gave him a share or not
3283729 five are regarded as martyrs they are those who die because of plague abdominal disease drowning or a falling building etc and the martyrs in allahs cause
3283730 plauge is the cause of martyrdom of every muslim who dies because of it
3283731 those of the believers who sit at home was revealed the prophet sent for zaid bin thabit who came with a shoulder blade and wrote on it
3283732 not equal are those believers who sit at home except those who are disabled by injury or are blind or lame etc and those who strive hard and fight in the way of allah with their wealth and lives
3283733 not equal are those believers who sit at home and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of allah with their wealth and lives 4 95
3283734 ibn maktum came to the prophet while he was dictating to me that very verse
3283735 o allahs apostle if i had power i would surely take part in jihad
3283736 except those who are disabled by injury or are blind or lame etc 4 95
3283737 when you face them i e your enemy then be patient
3283738 o allah the real life is that of the here after so please forgive the ansar and the emigrants
3283739 we are those who have given a pledge of allegiance to muhammad that we will carry on jihad as long as we live
3283740 we are those who have given a pledge of allegiance to muhammad that we will i carry on jihad as long as we live
3283741 o allah there is no good except the good of the hereafter so confer your blessings on the ansar and the emigrants
3283742 without you o allah we would have got no guidance
3283743 without you o allah we would have got no guidance nor given in charity nor prayed so please bless us with tranquility and make firm our feet when we meet our enemies indeed these people have rebelled against oppressed us but never shall we yield if they try to bring affliction upon us
3283744 some people have remained behind us in medina and we never crossed a mountain path or a valley but they were with us i
3283745 indeed anyone who fasts for one day for allahs pleasure allah will keep his face away from the hell fire for a distance covered by a journey of seventy years
3283746 whoever spends two things in allahs cause will be called by all the gate keepers of paradise who will be saying o so and so
3283747 nothing worries me as to what will happen to you after me except the temptation of worldly blessings which will be conferred on you
3283748 no doubt good produces nothing but good indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals because of gluttony except the vegetation eating animal which eats till both its flanks are full i e till it gets satisfied and then stands in the sun and defecates and urinates and again starts grazing this worldly property is sweet vegetation how excellent the wealth of the muslim is if it is collected through legal means and is spent in allahs cause and on orphans poor people and travelers but he who does not take it legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness against him on the day of resurrection
3283749 he who pre pares a ghazi going in allahs cause is given a reward equal to that of a ghazi and he who looks after properly the dependents of a ghazi going in allahs cause is given a reward equal to that of ghazi
3283750 i take pity on her as her brother was killed in my company
3283751 anas bin malik went to thabit bin qais who had lifted his clothes from his thighs and was applying hunut to his body anas asked o uncle what is holding you back from the battle he replied o my nephew i am coming just now and went on perfuming himself with hunut then he came and sat in the row anas then mentioned that the people fled from the battle field on that thabit said clear the way for me to fight the enemy we would never do so i e flee in the company of allahs apostle how bad the habits you have acquired from your enemies
3283752 who will bring me the information about the enemy on the day of the battle of al ahzab i e clans
3283753 every prophet had a disciple and my disciple is az zubair
3283754 every prophet had a disciple and my disciple is zubair bin al awwam
3283755 you two pronounce the adhan and the iqama for the prayer and let the elder of you lead the prayer
3283756 good will remain as a permanent quality in the foreheads of horses till the day of resurrection
3283757 there is a blessing in the fore heads of horses
3283758 good will remain as a permanent quality in the foreheads of horses for jihad till the day of resurrection for they bring about either a reward in the hereafter or booty in this world
3283759 if somebody keeps a horse in allahs cause motivated by his faith in allah and his belief in his promise then he will be rewarded on the day of resurrection for what the horse has eaten or drunk and for its dung and urine
3283760 o muadh do you know what allahs right on his slaves is and what the right of his slaves on him is
3283761 allahs right on his slaves is that they should worship him alone and should not worship any besides him and slaves right on allah is that he should not punish him who worships none besides him
3283762 o allahs apostle should i not inform the people of this good news
3283763 do not inform them of it lest they should depend on it absolutely
3283764 i have not seen anything of fright and i found it i e this horse very fast
3283765 evil omen is in three things the horse the woman and the house
3283766 if there is any evil omen in anything then it is in the woman the horse and the house
3283767 horses are kept for one of three purposes for some people they are a source of reward for some others they are a means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins
3283768 nothing has been revealed to me about them except this unique comprehensive verse
3283769 relate to me what you have heard from allahs apostle
3283770 i do not know whether that journey was for the purpose of jihad or umra
3283771 the prophet said whoever wants to return earlier to his family should hurry up
3283772 i did not see anything of fright and i found this horse very fast
3283773 did you flee deserting allahs apostle during the battle of hunain
3283774 i found your i e abu talhas horse very fast after that the horse could not be surpassed in running volume 4 book 52 number 120 narrated abdullah bin umar the prophet arranged for a horse race amongst the horses that had been made lean to take place between al hafya
3283775 the distance between al hafya and thaniya al wada is five or six miles and between thaniya and the mosque of bani zuraiq is one mile
3283776 abdullah bin umar was amongst those who participated in that horse race
3283777 allahs apostle arranged a horse race amongst the horses that had been made lean letting them start from al hafya and their limit distance of running was up to thaniyat al wada i asked musa what was the distance between the two places musa replied six or seven miles he arranged a race of the horses which had not been made lean sending them from thaniyat al wada and their limit was up to the mosque of bani zuraiq i asked what was the distance between those two places he replied one mile or so ibn umar was amongst those who participated in that horse race
3283778 it is allahs law that he brings down whatever rises high in the world
3283779 o abu umara did you flee on the day of the battle of hunain
3283780 no by allah the prophet did not flee but the hasty people fled and the people of the tribe of hawazin attacked them with arrows while the prophet was riding his white mule and abu sufyan bin al harith was holding its reins and the prophet was saying i am the prophet in truth i am the son of abdul muttalib
3283781 the best jihad for you is the performance of hajj
3283782 o allahs apostle invoke allah to make me one of them
3283783 you will be amongst the first group of them you will not be amongst the last
3283784 o chief of the believers give this garment to your wife the grand daughter of allahs apostle
3283785 she i e um salit used to carry the water skins for us on the day of uhud
3283786 would that a pious man from my companions guard me tonight
3283787 let the slave of dinar and dirham of quantify and khamisa i e money and luxurious clothes perish for he is pleased if these things are given to him and if not he is displeased
3283788 let the slave of dinar and dirham of quantify and khamisa perish as he is pleased if these things are given to him and if not he is displeased let such a person perish and relapse and if he is pierced with a thorn let him not find anyone to take it out for him paradise is for him who holds the reins of his horse to strive in allahs cause with his hair unkempt and feet covered with dust if he is appointed in the vanguard he is perfectly satisfied with his post of guarding and if he is appointed in the rearward he accepts his post with satisfaction he is so simple and unambiguous that if he asks for permission he is not permitted and if he intercedes his intercession is not accepted
3283789 i saw the ansar doing a thing i e showing great reverence to the prophet for which i have vowed that whenever i meet any of them i will serve him
3283790 this is a mountain that loves us andis loved by us
3283791 o allah i make the area which is in between medinas two mountains a sanctuary as abraham made mecca a sanctuary o allah bless us in our sa and mudd i e units of measuring
3283792 today those who were not fasting took all the reward
3283793 charity is obligatory everyday on every joint of a human being if one helps a person in matters concerning his riding animal by helping him to ride it or by lifting his luggage on to it all this will be regarded charity a good word and every step one takes to offer the compulsory congregational prayer is regarded as charity and guiding somebody on the road is regarded as charity
3283794 to guard muslims from infidels in allahs cause for one day is better than the world and whatever is on its surface and a place in paradise as small as that occupied by the whip of one of you is better than the world and whatever is on its surface and a mornings or an evenings journey which a slave person travels in allahs cause is better than the world and whatever is on its surface
3283795 choose one of your boy servants to serve me in my expedition to khaibar
3283796 o allah i seek refuge with you from distress and sorrow from helplessness and laziness from miserliness and cowardice from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men
3283797 this is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us
3283798 o allah i make the area between its i e medinas two mountains a sanctuary as abraham made mecca a sanctuary o allah bless them i e the people of medina in their mudd and sa i e measures
3283799 i was astonished to see in my dream some people amongst my followers on a sea voyage looking like kings on the thrones
3283800 o allahs apostle invoke allah to make me one of them
3283801 o allahs apostle invoke allah to make me one of them
3283802 you gain no victory or livelihood except through the blessings and invocations of the poor amongst you
3283803 a time will come when groups of people will go for jihad and it will be asked is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed the company of the prophet the answer will be yes then they will be given victory by allah because of him then a time will come when it will be asked is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed the company of the companions of the prophet it will be said yes and they will be given victory by allah then a time will come when it will be said is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed the company of the companions of the companions of the prophet it will be said yes and they will be given victory by allah
3283804 nobody did his job i e fighting so properly today as that man
3283805 indeed he is amongst the people of the hell fire
3283806 it is about the man whom you had described as one of the people of the hell fire the people were greatly surprised at what you said and i said i will find out his reality for you so i came out seeking him he got severely wounded and hastened to die by slanting the blade of his sword in the ground directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts then he eased on his sword and killed himself
3283807 a man may seem to the people as if he were practising the deeds of the people of paradise while in fact he is from the people of the hell fire another may seem to the people as if he were practicing the deeds of the people of hell fire while in fact he is from the people of paradise
3283808 o bani ismail practice archery as your father ismail was a great archer keep on throwing arrows and i am with bani so and so
3283809 how should we throw while you are with them i e on their side
3283810 when they do come near you throw arrows at them
3283811 throw the arrows let my parents sacrifice their lives for you
3283812 this bedouin took out my sword while i was sleeping and when i woke up i found the unsheathed sword in his hand and he challenged me saying who will save you from me i said thrice allah the prophet did not punish him but sat down
3283813 the face of the prophet as wounded and one of his front teeth as broken and the helmet over his head was smashed fatima washed of the blood while ali held water when she saw that bleeding was increasing continuously she burnt a mat of date palm leaves till it turned into ashes which she put over the wound and thus the bleeding ceased
3283814 this man took my sword out of its scabbard and said who will save you from me i replied allah so he put the sword back into its scabbard and you see him sitting here
3283815 o allah i ask you the fulfillment of your covenant and promise o allah if you wish to destroy the believers you will never be worshipped after today
3283816 this is sufficient o allahs apostle you have asked allah pressingly
3283817 there multitude will be put to flight and they will show their backs nay but the hour is their appointed time for their full recompense and that hour will be more grievous and more bitter than their worldly failure
3283818 the example of a miser and the one who gives in charity is like the example of two men wearing iron cloaks so tightly that their arms are raised forcibly towards their collar bones
3283819 the miser then tries to widen it but in vain
3283820 paradise is granted to the first batch of my followers who will undertake a naval expedition
3283821 the hour will not be established until you fight with the jews and the stone behind which a jew will be hiding will say
3283822 o muslim there is a jew hiding behind me so kill him
3283823 one of the portents of the hour is that you will fight with people wearing shoes made of hair and one of the portents of the hour is that you will fight with broad faced people whose faces will look like shields coated with leather
3283824 the hour will not be established until you fight with the turks people with small eyes red faces and flat noses their faces will look like shields coated with leather the hour will not be established till you fight with people whose shoes are made of hair
3283825 the hour will not be established till you fight with people wearing shoes made of hair
3283826 o abu umara did you all flee on the day of the battle of hunain
3283827 no by allah allahs apostle did not flee but his young unarmed companions passed by the archers of the tribe of hawazin and bani nasr whose arrows hardly missed a target and they threw arrows at them hardly missing a shot so the muslims retreated towards the prophet while he was riding his white mule which was being led by his cousin abu sufyan bin al harith bin abdul muttalib the prophet dismounted and invoked allah for victory then he said i am the prophet without a lie i am the son of abdul muttalib and then he arranged his companions in rows
3283828 o allah fill their i e the infidels houses and graves with fire as they busied us so much that we did not perform the prayer i e asr till the sun set
3283829 o allah save salama bin hisham o allah save al walid bin al walid o allah save aiyash bin rabia o allah save the weak muslims o allah be very hard on mudar tribe o allah afflict them with years of famine similar to the famine years of the time of prophet joseph
3283830 o allah the revealer of the holy book the swift taker of accounts o allah defeat al ahzab i e the clans o allah defeat them and shake them
3283831 o allah destroy the pagans of quraish o allah destroy quraish o allah destroy quraish
3283832 i saw them all killed and thrown in the badr well
3283833 if you reject islam you will be responsible for the sins of the peasants i e your people
3283834 o allahs apostle the people of the tribe of daus disobeyed and refused to follow you so invoke allah against them
3283835 o allah give guidance to the people of daus and let them embrace islam
3283836 the prophet then invoked allah to disperse them with full dispersion destroy them i
3283837 i replied i am the nearest relative to him he asked what degree of relationship do you have with him i replied he is my cousin and there was none of bani abu manaf in the caravan except myself caesar said let him come nearer he then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said to his translator tell his companions that i am going to ask this man about the man who claims to be a prophet if he tells a lie they should contradict him immediately
3283838 do the noble or the poor follow him i replied it is the poor who follow him he said are they increasing or decreasing day by day i replied they are increasing he said does anybody amongst those who embrace his the prophets religion become displeased and then discard his religion i replied no he said does he break his promises i replied no but we are now at truce with him and we are afraid that he may betray us
3283839 other than the last sentence i could not say anything against him
3283840 in the name of allah the most beneficent the most merciful this letter is from muhammad the slave of allah and his apostle to heraculius the ruler of the byzantine
3283841 when heraclius had finished his speech there was a great hue and cry caused by the byzantine royalties surrounding him and there was so much noise that i did not understand what they said so we were turned out of the court when i went out with my companions and we were alone i said to them verily ibn abi kabshas i e the prophets affair has gained power this is the king of bani al asfar fearing him
3283842 by allah i remained low and was sure that his religion would be victorious till allah converted me to islam though i disliked it
3283843 i will give the flag to a person at whose hands allah will grant victory
3283844 we will fight with them i e infidels till they become like us i e muslims
3283845 be patient till you face them and invite them to islam and inform them of what allah has enjoined upon them by allah if a single person embraces islam at your hands i e through you that will be better for you than the red camels
3283846 i have been ordered to fight with the people till they say none has the right to be worshipped but allah and whoever says none has the right to be worshipped but allah his life and property will be saved by me except for islamic law and his accounts will be with allah either to punish him or to forgive him
3283847 scarcely did allahs apostle set out for a journey on a day other than thursday
3283848 it is obligatory for one to listen to and obey the rulers orders unless these orders involve one disobedience to allah but if an act of disobedience to allah is imposed he should not listen to or obey it
3283849 we are the last but will be the foremost to enter paradise
3283850 he who obeys me obeys allah and he who disobeys me disobeys allah he who obeys the chief obeys me and he who disobeys the chief disobeys me the imam is like a shelter for whose safety the muslims should fight and where they should seek protection if the imam orders people with righteousness and rules justly then he will be rewarded for that and if he does the opposite he will be responsible for that
3283851 for what did the prophet take their pledge of allegiance was it for death
3283852 no but he took their pledge of allegiance for patience
3283853 ibn hanzala is taking the pledge of allegiance from the people for death

3283856 i just moved to town to work on the obama campaign and will be here through the november election i took a big pay cut to do this and want to save a few bucks by commuting on a bike but since ill only be here 3 months i dont want to buy one so im wondering if anyone out there has a reliable bike theyd consider lending renting for cheap or giving youll be serving your country well

3283872 coming back to the table negotiations peace talks a political solution thats it easy to say very difficult to do
3283873 it is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine
3283874 the european union and nato must take up the initiative and oppose the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
3283875 aggression against a small state in europe is not passed over in silence or with meaningless statements equating the victims with the perpetrators
3283876 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
3283877 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
3283878 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
3283879 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3283880 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3283881 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank if you do it you are on your own
3283882 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3283883 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3283884 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3283885 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about

3283890 the current conflict faces a real risk of escalation and expansion most prominently in abkhazia where the likelihood of an operation to clear georgian forces from the kodori gorge appears increasingly likely
3283891 air strikes are likely to continue for the immediate term as russia seeks to further degrade georgias military capabilities moscow is now likely to seek the restoration of south ossetias de facto independence albeit on much more favourable terms to the separatists and russia itself
3283892 the european and u s criticism of russias response is likely to lead to a further downturn in russo western relations although any more serious diplomatic responses will likely be dependent upon russian actions over the next few days
3283893 overall georgia is facing reduced control over both abkhazia and south ossetia a short to medium term reduction in its military capabilities and greatly reduced hopes of one day joining nato with the organisation likely to view tbilisis actions in south ossetia as being far too unpredictable for a potential alliance member
3283894 the military action in georgia is a reminder to financial markets that geopolitical risks remain significant even if in recent times they have been overshadowed by economic and credit risks
3283895 the russian invasion of georgia is not the first sign that the putin dominated kremlin has been gaining in confidence as its oil revenues swelled nevertheless it probably does represent the crossing of a line that puts an end to the relatively pacific chapter of world history that began in 1991
3283896 this was unfortunately all provoked by georgia it light heartedly started its military operation in south ossetia and saakashvili did not take into account such a reaction
3283897 of course the sympathy is on the side of the weaker group for georgia especially as it is fighting a country that has caused a lot of suffering to all of its neighbours
3283898 but realistic analysis show the georgians made a big mistake now georgia will have to take the toll most probably disproportionally severe
3283899 saying that russia is coming back to its imperialistic phobias is absolutely wrong russia has understood years ago europe is already outside of its jurisdiction
3283900 if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
3283901 i just hope but i have no high expectations that the international community will be able to stop the russians at this stage i dont think anyone can say with certainty what their objectives are will they stop with south ossetia and abkhazia
3283902 its payback time by the russians for what the west did in kosovo the russians are in a very strong position what we have to try to do as western countries is impose some form of consequence on russia
3283903 i believe the georgians were suckered into this and paid a very heavy price
3283904 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
3283905 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
3283906 its a region thats not a viable state its delusional for the south ossetians to think they could be independent
3283907 if it hadnt been for the russian intervention then the separatists would have been rolled over very quickly they wouldnt have had a prayer
3283908 some south ossetians would have fled but most probably it would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
3283909 as it is now they are looking at being a small outpost on the southern reaches of russia
3283910 this is not and was never about south ossetia south ossetia is a place where russia found a pretext for military aggression against georgia
3283911 georgia was made an example of concerning the cost of standing up to russia and developing a country independently and thinking to join euro atlantic institutions
3283912 its basically the putin doctrine restoring russian control over the former soviet union irrespective of what those countries want which is why this is so reminiscent of the episodes in prague in 1968 and budapest in 1956
3283913 its a return to the spheres of influence and an attempt to undermine the entire building of the european zone of prosperity and security this is the biggest thing to happen in europe at least since the balkan wars and it might have much larger implications
3283914 the only way to reduce tensions is to have an extremely strong response
3283915 both georgia and russia have been much less cautious than the market had expected this has developed in quite an unexpected way its very hard to make any calls right now on how the war situation will develop or how it will impact emerging markets
3283916 obviously there has been a significant impact on russian assets
3283917 obviously people will also be looking at the baltics ukraine the former soviet republics with borders with russia
3283918 the big difference is that you do not have any particular disputed border regions except for a very small area of estonia or areas of any particular areas with a large russian population
3283919 i think saakashvili knew from the very beginning that russia would invade ossetia after georgian troops were sent there saakashvili did that on purpose and wanted to show the world what russia is like today
3283920 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
3283921 this will distance georgias nato membership in the formal terms but in practice in the geopolitical sense this is strengthening georgias nato perspective
3283922 the kremlin must understand that it is making a dramatic mistake by using force in georgia for the first time since 1991 in a post soviet neighbourhood and the international community must consistently explain that to russia
3283923 i still believe the fighting will stop quite quickly because the long term interests remain the same for georgia this is not to resolve the situation by force and for russia basically not to resolve it at all
3283924 i think the tempers will cool and the parties will sit down at the negotiating table and basically return the situation where it was before this conflict
3283925 the disproportion of the forces is so big that the war does not have much sense and basically it is not in either sides interest to continue

3283931 naturen arkitekturen m det mellem kulturer alt sammen er det med til at skabe rammen for vores kurser centret ligger ikke i byen s de fleste kursister er p centret hele kurset igennem derfor er det vigtigt at de bliver stimuleret ogs udenfor undervisningslokalet vi har gjort meget ud af at opbygge faciliteter bibliotek computerrum sportsfaciliteter tr dl st internet osv men selve omr det er liges vigtigt der er plads og ro til at fordybe sig
3283932 den anden grund handler om ledelsesstil ledelsestrukturen p ms tcdc er meget horisontal vi har en ben organisationsstruktur baseret p gensidig respekt og det g lder for alle fra undervisere til reng ringspersonale vi pr ver at inkludere alle i centrets aktiviteter og den nd der er p stedet vi er et center der underviser i opbygning af lokalt demokrati og derfor er det vigtigt at vi selv implementerer de v rdier vi advokerer for derfor f r alle ansatte p centret fx ogs tilbud om efteruddannelse og vi har l nforhandlinger hvert andet r
3283933 tilsammen giver det en meget st rk organisationskultur alle fra ledelse til k kkenpersonale f ler et st rkt tilh rsforhold til centret og at de er med til at g re centret til det det er
3283934 udover et skift i fokus fra danske udviklingsarbejdere til lokale og regionale organisationer s er den m ske mest grundl ggende forandring at vi i dag er dybt integreret og tager del i det omliggende samfund politisk socialt kulturelt vi er ikke l ngere en
3283935 derudover har vi l bende ekspanderet igennem stort set hele perioden og det handler b de om st rre volumen flere og bedre faciliter og et langt st rre udbud af kurser vi har idag en bred vifte af tilbud der ogs
3283936 og sidst men ikke mindst er vi g et fra at v re 100 finansieret af danida til at v re 70 selvfinansieret det er noget vi har arbejdet m lrettet imod noget vi er stolte af og en tendens som vi satser p vil forts tte

3283945 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3283948 sen hillary rodham clinton told a gathering of supporters last week that shes looking for a strategy for her delegates to have their voices heard and respected at the democratic national convention where sen barack obama is expected to be nominated as the democratic presidential candidate
3283949 sources close to both obama and clinton told abc news that the new york senator is highly unlikely to allow her name to be formally submitted for a roll call vote on the convention floor the obama campaign wants to avoid such a vote since it would underscore the partys splits and remind voters of the divisive primary campaign between the two democrats the refusal to publicly announce her intentions is widely seen as a bargaining chip clinton is holding on to as party officials negotiate logistics regarding her convention speech and other activities according to several democrats who are closely involved in the matter
3283950 lanny davis a longtime friend and supporter of the clintons called the idea of putting clintons name into nomination a completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony still the fact that some clinton supporters are clamoring for a chance to vote for her at the convention is partly obamas fault he said davis who described himself as 100 percent behind obama in the general election said obama should be doing more in symbolic and substantive gestures to make clear he values and needs the support of former clinton supporters

3284070 league tables increase pressure on teachers to move away from authentic learning and towards merely preparation of students to pass tests
3284071 pates appears near the top so you might think i like league tables
3284072 however nothing could be further from the truth league tables impoverish education
3284073 how many points does the league table give for enjoying childhood or for preparation for adult life at or beyond university nil points
3284074 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children

3284089 plain and simple the guy was governor of new jersey he wasnt working for some huge corporation making a lot of money
3284090 their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
3284091 we honor the principle that a current spouse has no obligation to support someone elses child while accounting for the reality that the current spouse may provide economic resources to the household
3284092 new jersey does not give same sex couples like jim mcgreevey and mark odonnell the freedom to marry and to be legally equal spouses
3284093 when the law gives a couple responsibilities without equality the law must be changed
3284094 she was asking for the perks of a governor car driver clothing allowance
3284095 you get certain things when you have a job not when you leave it
3284096 we used to have guys coming out of the walls
3284097 it was the thing to do back then volunteer and help the community
3284098 probably only five guys still live in darby guys who grew up in darby keep coming back
3284099 they join when theyre young but then they get married
3284100 it used to be a lifetime commitment very few make it 20 years anymore
3284101 whats missing in manpower we make up for in mutual aid
3284102 there hasnt been a time when we had to scratch a call
3284103 all is still not well with all of our children
3284104 wastelands for human potential i want us to be a little uncomfortable if we continue to be satisfied with steady progress it will take us more than 30 years to close the achievement gap
3284105 lots of money is going into those schools but its targeted lots of support but lots of monitoring
3284106 is what got me out of bed for 38 years now
3284107 its what brought me out of retirement to the city of philadelphia to be a superintendent one more time against the advice of everybody i knew
3284108 we knew what the marching orders were going to be
3284109 if teachers teach students learn and thats whats expected nothing less
3284110 were trying to make it happen the next thing is to focus on making
3284111 theres a lot to do we have to acknowledge the fact that we have a long way to go
3284112 will feels it was an injustice and he is down about the decision
3284113 you look at europe for example switzerland they have their own famous sightseeing trains

3284121 i have a question am i still allowed to vote
3284122 all i can say is that he will testify truthfully for whichever party asks him
3284123 and they are willing to do it again in support of their country
3284124 everybody is going to make sure weapons are cleaned vehicles are going to be squared away everybody is going to know what to look for
3284125 i think the reality of it is finally setting in for them
3284126 to take care of soldiers and bring everybody back home
3284127 youre looking at a handful of us most of the guys got out or are broken and cant go
3284128 and we are 100 times more prepared to meet the missions were assigned
3284129 there are some guys in my unit who i dont think want to go
3284130 but two i do like the military i dont like the hurry up and wait aspect but its pretty good plus a lot of my friends were going to be going back
3284131 i think theyre glad to be out and theyre also concerned for their georgian friends and their families
3284132 its hard to imagine going back but theyve invested time and have relationships with the people so i know in their hearts they want to go back
3284133 is drawn to helping people and was nearly finished her training in georgia
3284134 she was teaching some local kids and was about to start her two year commitment there
3284135 as the tensions were rising on thursday night and friday morning the peace corps gathered its members together first the 47 trainees including lindsey harris and then 38 other volunteers who were already working in the country
3284136 they were far enough away from the fighting not to hear it but the georgian people from the city of gori who were training the peace corps volunteers saw homes and apartment buildings lost
3284137 when she got to the ski resort on saturday she said mom it was like being on vacation
3284138 she said she was sitting on a balcony at the resort reading a book and found it hard to imagine that there was bombing just 20 miles away
3284139 they thought it would have taken five hours but after 10 hours they had only made it two thirds of the way
3284140 was pretty cool when i talked to her from the bus i feel more comfortable now but i know shes saddened by whats happened the georgian people were excited about rebuilding their country
3284141 it appears hes stabbing himself in the chest with the knife
3284142 the teen was on the phone apparently talking about killing himself
3284143 i heard a lot of talking and i heard a lot of banging
3284144 its a good kind of stress its a great problem to have
3284145 its a responsibility to do the most and the best good we possibly can
3284146 its comforting to think we will have this endowment to support us as we look to the future
3284147 its totally up to them what they want to do
3284148 the fbi probe into the senator has really set him off he wants all the blackberries wiped
3284149 this is a reminder to everyone that under no circumstances are you to save ay messages in your in box or sent items that is sent to or received from vjf
3284150 wiped a computer and the next day someone confiscated would they be able to tell if it was wiped at all
3284151 i cant help you lets hope they are not sophisticated enough to notice
3284152 you really have to clean your mailbox up this is the kind of s that can get us in trouble
3284153 good luck to them because they are going to need it
3284154 the boss is driving us all nuts with this fbi madness
3284155 hopefully this will blow over real soon but right now i am stressed
3284156 i dont blame fumo the fbi is really coming at him hard and he is innocent
3284157 i truly believe that or i wouldnt do this when they cant find anything wrong they try to manufacutre stuff so they can justify the man hours and money spent on a fruitless investigation
3284158 we have everything under control thats just the way it has to be for now they fbi wont be around forever then we can go back to our normal routine
3284159 the problem is one that is quite serious across the state
3284160 were out of free fall but were not in an era when social capital has gone up
3284161 we really have to put it on the front burner when we get back no pun intended
3284162 i think its an obscenity i cannot imagine that people in that situation who did what they did to their own daughter are attempting to profit from it
3284163 despite their the parents egregious denial of her danieals existence in life they now seek to profit by her tragic death that they caused
3284164 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment
3284165 the beneficiaries could be these kids danieals siblings and that could be a positive outcome
3284166 reimbursement for medical bills funeral and interment expenses and administrative expenses
3284167 he viewed her dead body before she was removed by the medical examiners office
3284168 the resolutions in the provincial assemblies are aimed at exerting moral pressure on president musharraf
3284169 the governor thinks this is an inappropriate practice that e zpass should be used for business purposes this is something that should be corrected
3284170 use of a companys products for its employees is very standard the trips represent only a fraction of a percent of toll revenues
3284171 gov paterson has every confidence the port authority will address this in a way that is fair to its employees and the taxpayers of new york and new jersey
3284172 its not our policy to allow it for personal use
3284173 we are working with the governors office to schedule the meeting to discuss our project
3284174 developing and designing a world class entertainment facility that will positively transform south columbus boulevard making it more pedestrian friendly improving traffic flow and providing riverfront access to the community for the first time
3284175 the program was suspended as soon as the problem was discovered
3284176 we are in the midst of an investigation to find out what happened
3284177 was there something wrong with us medically are they under any obligation to tell us i would imagine they would be
3284178 the brachytherapy and warfarin dosage issues are unrelated and it is a coincidence that they were discovered within a short period of time
3284179 the routine in the u s is to assess the implant at three to four weeks out
3284180 the worst case scenario is that their prostate cancer wasnt adequately treated and it never went away or it came back
3284181 fortunately many of these men probably had low risk prostate cancer so hopefully they will be ok
3284182 warfarin dosing comparison of a pharmacogenetic algorithmic approach with the current empirical approach
3284183 if they didnt get irb approval and they didnt get consent from people and theyre taking the blood for research then its wrong on lots of levels
3284184 consumers will get to enjoy the best of the programming on both services
3284185 theyll also be able to pick and choose channels at a lower price
3284186 this is a slap on the wrist for comcast but it will be a cutting off of the hand for the next provider who violates rules
3284187 if we didnt do this wed go out of business
3284188 i dont quite see metering as an outrage and in fact is probably the fairest system going though of course the psychology of knowing that youre paying for bandwidth may change behavior
3284189 i love this product no more endless days spent in bed surrounded by tissues and syrups just a few tablets and symptoms are a thing of the past amazing
3284190 i am writing in to let you guys know how much this product has helped me i had a big ice hockey tournament coming up last week i woke up with a running nose and i couldnt stop sneezing which quickly progressed by mid morning my mother uses your immunityplus and i quickly ordered this flugo stuff online all i can say is wow my symptoms improved and i could feel my body fighting back i was able to take part in the tournament and i wasnt groggy or jittery like when i take over the counter meds thanks so much

3284198 said stewart a baker assistant secretary for policy at the
3284199 european governments are entering into these agreements much more readily than they were four five years ago because concerns about terrorism are no longer confined to one side of the atlantic
3284200 we seem to be opening the floodgates left right and center
3284201 it seems to me there are hardly any restrictions left
3284202 personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin political opinion or religious or other beliefs trade union membership or information concerning health and sexual life
3284203 any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
3284204 recognizing the special sensitivity of the above categories of personal data shall take suitable safeguards in particular appropriate security measures in order to protect such data
3284205 which data are of concern is not really completely clear second who are the competent authorities on the u s side third and most important there is a lack of independent supervision in the united states over data protection
3284206 its all well and good to say the estonian government will provide a right of access and redress but under what circumstances is an american citizen going to know that the estonian government has even received his information
3284207 i was talking with him this morning and he will go with us to belgium
3284208 he is progressing really well but we will check after training i will speak with the doctor and with steven and then decide
3284209 i dont support additional legislation because i think we have authority
3284210 network management has never been defined and they are now saying we are defining it now and you violated it
3284211 what this means is that the internet is the first mass medium with a legal guaranteed access for anybody
3284212 we believe the order which we think will be favored by an fcc majority will be negative for comcast and set some precedents that could trouble other cable and even telecom broadband providers
3284213 the reason why you cant do enforcement on the principles alone is that they arent rules and they didnt go through the rulemaking process that is required to make regulation
3284214 i love it because any citizen can go there and enter their address and see whats going on around them
3284215 it really simplifies our desire to get that information out to the community in a packet that is easy to use
3284216 the big thing that i see is that it does enable us as a state to coordinate activities and analyze crime patterns and trends on a regional basis
3284217 of course the ultimate goal is seamless coordination and consistent information sharing to improve public safety
3284218 we think its a wonderful tool for the community to have to get a visual idea of whats going on in their community
3284219 the bottom line is the u s is trying to give the impression in europe that theres a simple well established process for records access that any european can avail themselves of
3284220 but as this lawsuit shows its a difficult time consuming process that might ultimately not result in anything being obtained
3284221 i dont expect to find anything specific in the files
3284222 but i am entitled to know what is in them
3284223 there must be something if im traveling in and out of the united states

3284246 mccain likes to say he would rather lose an election than lose a war to this i guess his campaign is now awkwardly adding that he would rather lose an election than have terrorists succeed in another attack the sad part is that now we are having this conversation we can look forward to days of cable news chatter over the issue and meta chatter about who benefits from the chatter is it a dark atwaterian rovian ploy or another embarrassing mccain campaign stumble

3284253 cubans are now allowed to purchase mobile phones and dvd players and computers
3284254 now that the cuban people can be trusted with mobile phones
3284255 they should also be trusted to speak freely in public now that the cuban people will be allowed to have toasters in two years they should stop needing to worry about whether they will have bread today
3284256 if ra l is serious about his so called reforms
3284257 he will allow these phones to reach the cuban people

3284265 to call us an arm of the dnc is a joke
3284266 we have people with multiple points of view everyone is getting a little thin skinned we argue and debate every topic
3284267 we happen to have programs that at times are driven by opinion on msnbc and we have a worldwide news organization driven by nbc news
3284268 the only people trying to lump it all together are people who tend to view these things through a political filter or are our competitors
3284269 international organized crime poses a serious threat not only to the united states and romania but to all nations
3284270 criminals who exploit the power and convenience of the internet do not recognize national borders therefore our efforts to prevent their attacks cannot end at our borders either

3284295 creo que siempre hay mucha presi n al enfrentar a un equipo tan poderoso como estados unidos pero las muchachas hicieron lo mejor posible
3284296 vamos a aprender mucho de ella y ma ana las cosas saldr n mejor
3284297 por supuesto que siempre vamos a tener problemas frente a estados unidos siempre perdemos por cuatro o cinco carreras
3284298 its a sensible deal theyre not betting the farm on it
3284299 it gets them entry into the market and thats what its all about but its a very very long term one
3284300 this is another exciting development for tesco it complements our entries into china and the united states giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world

3284302 market conditions are obviously challenging and have adversely affected the capital markets division however collins stewart has three other business in hawkpoint securities and wealth management which are still operating profitably
3284303 no one knows better than a broadcaster that localism is the lifeblood of our business
3284304 given the seismic changes and increased fragmentation in todays media world we would respectfully ask how increasing mandates on broadcasters and broadcasters alone will serve the public interest
3284305 political cover to weaken broadcast ownership rules and permit more media consolidation
3284306 for over a quarter century the commission has outsourced its obligation to ensure that broadcasters will address the programming needs and interests of the people in their communities of license
3284307 at the top of our list is a commitment to public service in their news operations
3284308 the question is over time have they served the needs of their community defined by the community or have they broadcast what they like to broadcast
3284309 no es una sensaci n agradable irme temprano del torneo algo est aconteciendo en m en los ltimos meses es algo que me est pasando un momento de desconfianza
3284310 creo que no he dicho nada sobre retiro estoy buscando una soluci n es un a o dif cil para m porque no estoy en mi mejor momento mis expectativas no son las mismas que a os anteriores pero sigo entrenando
3284311 aqu una derrota se siente m s pesada y dolorosa porque es una llevando la bandera de mi pa s pero no fue por el partido de dobles ni la humedad no son excusas porque a todos se nos exige jugar en las mismas circunstancias

3284313 fails to make the substantial changes necessary to bring the federal government into the 21st century
3284314 we knew it wouldnt meet everyones wish list but experts tell us its an important start in dealing with the challenges of electronic records
3284315 the vast majority of federal agencies treat electronic records like paper records by printing them out and saving them in paper files
3284316 record chaos the deplorable state of electronic record keeping in the federal government
3284317 there has to be a massive effort to push the government into the 21st century
3284318 having it all together in one place brings us one step closer to the kind of scary movie scenario where they can track somebody moving across the city
3284319 will provide decision makers with a more efficient and effective source of video information both for day to day monitoring as well as during emergencies
3284320 to have police or any government persons looking at those cameras is a waste of money
3284321 these cameras are there so theyre already in use were just not making the best use of them
3284322 we really need to come up with a district wide policy to make sure we dont violate any civil liberties and dont co mingle monitoring functions with police surveillance
3284323 its clear looking at other cities that cameras displace crime they dont reduce crime
3284324 we dont want the camera swooping in on a cute girl in a short skirt
3284325 the distinction between the private and public sectors will be blurred
3284326 i dont believe our transportation infrastructure will ever catch up
3284327 maryland is building light rail the district is doing streetcars the little change we will see in transportation infrastructure is totally disconnected
3284328 housing sales in this region had the best october in history
3284329 european cities have lived with terrorism for years and years
3284330 the next period will be about recapturing the public realm from fear of crime and of people who are different
3284331 the fear that led to gated communities and shopping in enclosed boxes will give way to streets that feel more friendly safer and more full of cultural experiences
3284332 the more technology permeates our lives the more people want to be together
3284333 the internet will be pinged and hacked and become unreliable
3284334 the government is the next big player in affordable housing because the government has land

3284339 by charles stross oddly enough its another book about an artificial person a woman but this time it is about a post human society of the robots and androids we left behind its a lot of cloak amp dagger espionage amongst the androids and its an interesting idea i believe this may be the best one ive read covering post human artificial intelligence not recommended for children lots of gratuitous but non graphic sex the sort where you know whats going on but its not intended to be too graphic it was an interesting read but i doubt id read it twice use of weapons

3284362 dec 19 was our first group session and essentially its a support group for girls age 9 to 18
3284363 we ran two separate groups one for 14 and 15 year olds and another for 16 to 17 year olds so we havent worked with any younger girls it seems like were having better luck getting the older girls to participate in the program
3284364 each week we have either a verbal or creative activity we work on weve done collages we do a lot of journal writing and weve done role playing in the past
3284365 when some of these girls are placed on probation if we think they are a good candidate for the program the probation officer will send over a referral
3284366 the majority of the feedback weve received has been positive
3284367 once we have a group established its a closed group so they start to almost feel like family they start to open up and realize they arent the only ones dealing with certain issues
3284368 we talked with other probation officers about it and how successful they felt it was so we brought the idea back to our court
3284369 here in portage county the other court staff have been very receptive to it
3284370 im really pleased with the results ive seen so far
3284371 opinion polls are one thing but on every occasion that the voters have been asked to cast a vote since the november election there has been a massive swing against labor
3284372 in the gippsland by election when both brendan nelson and prime minister kevin rudd took a very high profile role there was a 10 per swing against labor
3284373 weve seen a swing against labor in the northern territory and i believe there will be a massive swing against labor here in western australia at the next state election
3284374 it demonstrates that when people actually have to focus on the issues and cast a vote they are reflecting their disillusionment and their dismay with labor governments across the country
3284375 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3284376 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate

3284390 im going to recommend you come in for an in person interview the coding was a little weak to be honest but i think you have great potential
3284391 i cant tell you who comes after this if you do well the last interviewer will take you to the next person if you dont do so well theyll take you back here and well talk about it
3284392 there was a piece of lawn that was labelled as the under 15 rugby teams victory spot last year
3284393 they planted grass there and we were told to respect it since then various black pupils who walk past have been hassled so we named it the no kaffir zone
3284394 when i turned around and asked who had done it one of the boys pushed me i fell on a pole and hurt myself then i got up and pushed him too the other one started swearing at me so i grabbed him by the jersey
3284395 thats when the teacher showed up and took us to the principal
3284396 there were almost no civilians there as they were evacuated previously
3284397 we want to get the youth off the street and stop alcohol and drug abuse
3284398 when i refused permission for the event to be held on the rugby field the council threatened to sue the club
3284399 we cant host a game now as players could sustain serious cut wounds
3284400 we were involved at a very late stage and were never informed that liquor would be freely available
3284401 although mighty proud of our premier league achievements and success in the champions league we know that we have to start all over again
3284402 certainly thats the point i have been emphasizing to the players during our pre season preparations
3284403 for while i enjoyed the celebrations as much as anyone last may i never allow myself to get carried away
3284404 the euphoria for me evaporates very quickly as i lock the memories away and start to prepare for the next challenge
3284405 i expect the players to follow that lead and i know they will because as always i have studied their reactions and i am satisfied that the driving hunger for more success is still burning within them
3284406 what have i been doing for the last 34 years i must have missed something or been asleep somewhere
3284407 they are saying because of scolaris experience chelsea are going to win the league i do not understand that
3284408 of course we had a little thing with ronaldo this summer but we have a good squad of players
3284409 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does there will be injuries loss of form red cards and clearly we need luck at crucial times as well
3284410 the likes of anderson rooney nani and ronaldo theyre all going to progress
3284411 the young lads will continue to progress im looking for big things from them and hopefully that progression will help us retain the trophies we won last year
3284412 we also have the experience of the likes of ryan giggs paul scholes and gary neville theyre remarkable men
3284413 its not that the faa is disarming its soldiers but we need to have greater control of weaponry and guarantee greater security for the maintenance of peace and stability in the country
3284414 this particular one was chosen to demonstrate our might of going below sea level to sabotage oil facilities
3284415 this is one of our plans to cripple the economic base of rivers state
3284416 maggie is back home with her family after a congress lake road teen found the missing dog two weeks after she escaped a house fire
3284417 her mom mustve been in the background picking up a word here and there because i heard her screaming
3284418 what if the dog wasnt maggie and shed gotten the familys hopes up for nothing
3284419 she alysha oaks the daughter asked me if the dog had one ear up and one ear down

3284421 i believe that socially assistive robotics has a part to play in helping families
3284422 the winning margin in spitzs relay races ranged from 3 to 6 seconds
3284423 when i flipped at the 50 and saw how far ahead he was the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way
3284424 i got a supercharge and took it from there it was unreal
3284425 his last 50 were absolutely incredible he had a perfect finish
3284426 theres never been a split like this in my memory not running down somebody who holds the world record whos on their game that was incredible
3284427 the 400 free relay has been spanked around the last two olympics this was the toughest one to win those are always the best ones to win

3284431 i am super proud of logan and how he has never let his team down
3284432 he always comes through he is super dedicated and always stays cool under pressure
3284433 we have had unbelievable kids and parents over the past four years
3284434 i cant even explain how great they have been all are very dedicated both parents and players there are never any complaints
3284435 the parents are always offering to help with extra work
3284436 whether it is helping another parent drop off or pick up a player scrap books videos or pictures everyone just has a lot of fun
3284437 i am proud of all the kids in the brimfield organization
3284438 each year they seem to get stronger and stronger and their interest level grows as they keep learning

3284445 cable is also being watermarked so that police can identify them if they are sold
3284446 were still trying to identify those young guys and letting them roll lappano said
3284447 well do that a couple of more days and around friday well have to say that we are looking for seven receivers and four running backs and the rest of them thats just the way it is
3284448 some of them are doing pretty good some of them are struggling a little bit he said
3284449 but this happens every year so they make plays when they know what they are doing some of them make some really nice plays that make you go wow they are pretty good
3284450 i asked them if anyone was scared and wanted to go home today and they said no everybody looks good in their laundry meaning before pads are on but they seem not to shy away from contact
3284451 we just need to make sure that thing is as stable as it needs to be before we step on the gas he said
3284452 we dont want to go too far too fast we still have three weeks before we have to play football
3284453 before that decision gets made hes going to have to show me that he can go full speed and not limp around or not have any soreness denbrock said
3284454 because the last thing we are going to do is put him in jeopardy or re injuring that
3284455 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3284456 the furniture and home related sectors continue to bear the brunt of falling consumer confidence and increasing demands on household budgets
3284457 the strength of the current order book and contribution from recent acquisitions will deliver further progress in the second half of the year
3284458 continued strong performance underpins the boards confidence in achieving current market consensus for profit before tax intangibles amortisation and exceptional items
3284459 market conditions are obviously challenging and have adversely affected the capital markets division
3284460 frankly speaking the way its dropping i think 800 will be taken out very soon just look at the rise in the dollar and plunge in the euro golds decline is quite justifiable
3284461 gold has broken the chart points and everybody is rushing to sell their gold it seems to be very bad we are waiting for gold to hit 800
3284462 with everything falling i guess platinum will follow suit i am currently looking at the 1 400 levels for support
3284463 organic beauty products have a reputation of being watery earthy and lackluster when really things have come a long way in the world of organic cosmetics skin care is important to most people especially women and it is also important that they know they have the option to use high quality luxury products that work just as well as their traditional products but contain none of the toxic ingredients
3284464 organicbeautysource com is meant to be equally as useful to the experienced organic cosmetics shopper as to the newcomer i am researching reviewing and adding new listings regularly and encourage visitors to leave their comments so we can all be better informed
3284465 what this means is that almost every page is now a place for conversations
3284466 instead of just reading static product descriptions we encourage site visitors to create conversations with the commenting blog feature almost every page on the site is bloggable so our customers and partners can interact and contribute to the conversations regarding how our transformational legacy modernization tlm platform can help organizations overcome their legacy system headaches at lower cost and risk than any other approach

3284471 most of us dont live in brazil so we cant eat freshly picked acai and since the fruit is highly perishable it cant be transported to other countries in fresh form so the only real options are freezing the skin and pulp or freeze drying it we think freeze dried acai is the best for a number of reasons
3284472 freeze dried acai and specifically our favorite acai supplement called perfect acai is as close as most people will get to eating fresh acai berries from the amazon rainforest in brazil
3284473 the reason the perfect acai product is our favorite and our customers favorite is because this product is the purest acai supplement on the market its the most potent since its 100 pure organic acai it is also priced the best by far
3284474 perfect acai is the perfect acai product because it fits all of our essential criteria for selecting a quality acai product which includes potency purity and price
3284475 an informed acai berry consumer is our best customer whenever you have an exciting new product like this and the ensuing hype the inevitable health food imposters will start to appear and that has already begun

3284505 practitioners need a common language to talk about problems facing conservationists and potential solutions that they encounter
3284506 these can then be shared through common databases of conservation practice enabling practitioners to share and compare experiences more readily ultimately leading to the development of a more systematic science of biodiversity conservation
3284507 just as it has become accepted scientific practice to refer to species by their scientific name alongside their common name we hope that conservationists will use the classifications of threats and actions to describe and report on their work around the world

3284556 kata kata ini beberapa kali digunakan oleh kitab suci yang bisa dipahami bila perbuatan melihat yang dimaksudkan adalah secara sadar dengan inderawi jasmani dan bukan didalam mimpi misalnya firman allah kepada nabi muhammad saw
3284557 sesungguhnya jika tuhanku tidak memberi petunjuk kepadaku pastilah aku termasuk orang yang sesat
3284558 hai kaumku sesungguhnya aku berlepas diri dari apa yang kamu persekutukan sesungguhnya aku menghadapkan diriku kepada rabb yang menciptakan langit dan bumi dengan cenderung kepada agama yang benar dan aku bukanlah termasuk orang orang yang mempersekutukan tuhan qs 6 76 79 beranjak dari defenisi rukyat ini maka dalam kaitannya dengan proses penentuan awal bulan baru pada penanggalan islam hijriah berartikan sebagai melihat dengan mata kepala lahiriah akan status visibilitas hilal atau penampakan bulan sabit dilangit secara langsung 1 kelemahan utama dari sistem rukyat ini ada pada keterbatasan mata inderawi kita terhadap halangan halangan yang bisa timbul dilangit saat pengamatan seperti cuaca mendung hingga penglihatan tertutup awan hitam ketinggian tempat pengamatan waktu dan lain sebagainya permasalahan klasik tersebut sudah disadari juga oleh rasulullah saw sehingga kemudian beliau bersabda berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal bulan sabit dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika kalian terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah syaban tiga puluh hari
3284559 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya dan janganlah kalian berbuka sampai melihatnya hilal syawal jika ia hilal terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah bilangan tiga puluh hari kemudian berbukalah iedul fithri dan satu bulan itu 29 hari
3284560 apabila datang bulan ramadhan maka berpuasalah 30 hari kecuali sebelum itu kalian melihat hilal
3284561 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan penampakan hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
3284562 sesungguhnya kami ini umat yang ummi tidak pandai menulis dan tidak pandai menghitung perjalanan bulan bulan itu ada yang begini begini dan begini dikurangi beliau dengan ibu jari pada kali yang ketiga 29 dan bulan itu ada yang begini begini dan begini 30
3284563 dan orang yang berpijak pada hisab dalam menentukan hilal sebagaimana ia sesat dalam syariat iapun telah berbuat bidah dalam agama dia telah salah dalam hal akal dan ilmu hisab
3284564 manusia sedang melihat lihat munculnya hilal aku beritahukan kepada nabi saw bahwa aku melihatnya maka beliau berpuasa dan memerintahkan manusia untuk berpuasa
3284565 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan
3284566 dan apabila dikatakan kepada mereka ikutilah apa yang diturunkan oleh allah mereka menjawab tidak tetapi kami dapati dari perbuatan nenek moyang kami apakah mereka akan mengikuti juga walaupun nenek moyang mereka tidak mengikuti suatu apapun dan tidak mendapat petunjuk
3284567 bulan ramadhan bulan yang di dalamnya diturunkan permulaan sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda haq dan batil karena itu barangsiapa di antara kamu hadir di bulan itu
3284568 dan telah kami tetapkan bagi bulan garis edarnya sehingga setelah dia sampai ketitik edar tertentu kembalilah dia sebagai bentuk tandan yang tua
3284569 sesungguhnya kami ini segolongan umat yang ummi kami tidak pandai menulis dan tidak bisa menghitung sebulan itu ada yang begini dan begini yaitu kadang kadang 29 hari dan kadang kadang 30 hari
3284570 kalau misalnya hiduplah nabi kita muhammad saw dijaman kita ini agaknya akan beliau suruhkanlah bilal bin rabah melakukan azan dengan memakai loadspeaker dan mikrofon akan beliau suruhkan agaknya muaz bin djabal menyebarkan islam kenegeri yaman bahkan keseluruh dunia dengan memakai radio
3284571 perintah berpuasa sesudah melihat bulan dengan mata kepala adalah lil irsyad bukan lil idjab yaitu melihat bulan dengan mata kepala hanyalah salah satu jalan memulai puasa tetapi bukan satu satunya jalan ini hanya jalan yang ditempuh oleh umat yang belum pandai berhisab karenanya sangat menggelikan hati kalau orang berpuasa yang fanatik kepada lahir perintah terus menetapkan bahwa dialah rukyat bil fili satu satunya jalan buat memulai puasa
3284572 sebenarnya bulan itu dua puluh sembilan hari maka janganlah kamu berpuasa sampai kamu melihat bulan dan janganlah kamu berbuka sampai kamu melihatnya
3284573 lalu kami tentukan bentuknya maka kami lah sebaik baik yang menentukan
3284574 wahai masyarakat jin dan manusia jika kalian sanggup menembus melintasi penjuru langit dan bumi silahkan lintasi tapi kamu tidak dapat menembusnya kecuali dengan
3284575 sesuatu yang diketahui dengan jelas oleh akal sulit dibayangkan akan bartentangan dengan syariat sama sekali bahkan dalil naqli yang shahih tidak akan bertentangan dengan akal yang lurus sama sekali kita tahu bahwa para rasul tidak memberikan kabar dengan sesuatu yang mustahil menurut akal
3284576 seseorang hendaknya berpuasa bersama penguasa dan jamaah umat islam baik ketika cuaca cerah ataupun mendung
3284577 akan ada sepeninggalku nanti para penguasa yang mereka itu tidak berpegang dengan petunjukku dan tidak mengikuti caraku dan akan ada diantara para penguasa tersebut orang orang yang berhati setan namun berbadan manusia
3284578 hendaknya engkau mendengar dan mentaati penguasa tersebut walaupun punggungmu dicambuk dan hartamu dirampas olehnya maka dengarkanlah dan taatilah
3284579 puasa itu pada hari ketika kalian semua berpuasa idul fitri pada hari ketika kalian semua ber idul fitri dan idul adha ketika kalian semua beridul adha
3284580 seburuk buruk penguasa kalian adalah yang kalian benci dan mereka pun membenci kalian kalian mencaci mereka dan mereka pun mencaci kalian
3284581 jangan selama mereka masih mendirikan shalat di tengah tengah kalian dan jika kalian melihat mereka mengerjakan perbuatan yang tidak kalian sukai maka bencilah perbuatannya dan jangan meninggalkan ketaatan
3284582 kewajiban seorang muslim adalah mendengar dan taat dalam melakukan perintah yang disukai ataupun yang tidak disukai kecuali bila diperintahkan melakukan maksiat bila dia diperintah melakukan maksiat maka tidak ada kewajiban untuk mendengar serta taat
3284583 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat bulan dan berhari rayalah kalian karena melihat bulan dan beribadahlah kalian karena melihat bulan kemudian jika bulan itu terdinding awan maka genapkanlah tiga puluh hari tetapi jika ada dua saksi muslim yang melihatnya maka berpuasalah kalian dan berhari rayalah
3284584 kewajiban seorang muslim adalah mendengar dan taat dalam melakukan perintah yang disukai ataupun yang tidak disukai kecuali bila diperintahkan melakukan maksiat bila dia diperintah melakukan maksiat maka tidak ada kewajiban untuk mendengar serta taat
3284585 tidak ada ketaatan kepada seorang makhluk yang dapat dibenarkan jika hal itu berupa perbuatan maksiat terhadap al khaliq
3284586 kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah dan rasul sunnahnya jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu adalah lebih utama dan lebih baik akibatnya
3284587 hendaklah kamu mengikuti dengan sunnahku dan sunnah khulafaur rasyidin yang mendapat petunjuk dimasa setelah aku
3284588 adalah apa apa yang bersesuaian dengan kebenaran walaupun engkau sendirian
3284589 jamaah itu adalah apa apa yang bersesuaian dengan ketaatan pada allah azza wajalla
3284590 jamaah itu demi allah adalah kumpulan orang orang ahli kebenaran walaupun mereka itu sedikit
3284591 sesungguhnya aku hendak memperingatkanmu pada satu hal yaitu supaya kamu menghadap allah berdua dua atau sendiri sendiri
3284592 sesungguhnya umatku tidak berkumpul diatas kesesatan maka dari itu bila kamu melihat perselisihan maka hendaklah kamu
3284593 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3284594 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3284595 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3284597 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3284598 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3284600 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3284601 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3284602 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3284613 she just completed a 78 5 mile road race i dont think
3284614 just 2 of articles and 1 of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and womens sports just 1 4 of sports photography featured women and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports pages there were more images of models footballers girlfriends the french presidents wife and a nun than of sportswomen
3284615 there were 367 links from the front page to articles but just five links went to female sports 1 there was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites out of 129 images both photos and film there were four images of women 3 sky sports did have a film of two female sports presenters a third image was of former big brother contestant kate lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot and a fourth image was of an advert for womens health
3284616 team ethos an interest in what the british team is doing as a whole there isnt a separation between male and female events
3284617 when you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court theres definitely an attitude that theyre looking for the feminine shot those moments when they can zoom in on a womans legs for example and then in all the tennis coverage theres the massive interest in fashion even the people who are interviewing the women post match will say how are you going to dress for tonights event which is a long way off the point
3284618 whats great with the olympics is the immediacy of it all you see the women competing and then theyre on the rostrum straight away looking incredibly natural and thats so great to see when it comes to tennis coverage there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now a lot of the promotion around wimbledon this year concerned parties for instance rather than just that specific focus on the sports field
3284619 my coach rang to say bmx had been introduced to the olympics that was it id wanted to be an english teacher but you can go back to college you cant go back to being an olympic gold medallist

3284624 the hydraulics failed they were about to land then all these alarms went off because the hydraulics had failed on one side of the plane they had to fly all the way back to zurich with the landing gear extended and land there it was a very rough landing and it became chaos after that
3284625 all of my books are really romances typically love triangles
3284626 i was driving home in the middle of the night after having been to my fathers house in the mountains i began to imagine the story of someone probably a travelling salesman who had to travel a great deal periodically when he felt overwhelmed by the circumstances of his life he would park his car by the side of the road leave the headlights on walk a few paces in front of the car and then lie down as if he was the victim of an accident or a heart attack or a crime
3284627 he could have this enormous cathartic emotional outburst in their arms people would console him and tell him that everything was going to be all right that is what the story choke started as me in the dirt
3284628 the contrast between what i would have thought of this person had i seen him on the street and who he really was was so shocking it made me look at people in a different way and realise that seemingly the most boring person may have the most fascinating inner life
3284629 i have no idea what to say to people i have no idea how to be with people
3284630 so many author events can be boring and pretentious i really dont want those kids to be bored it is worth the effort to make the events crazy so that its more likely they will come back
3284631 my private history in terms of people in my life who are dead is very easy to discuss i dont feel those people can be threatened or intruded upon now but i am enormously protective of the people who are currently in my life my existing friends and family that is where the curtain is drawn
3284632 its about doing everything youve been taught to do as a child and then realising you dont know what to do next and also realising that those nice things youve been taught to do are only going to get you so far and unless you do something differently youre going to be that disappointed child for the rest of your life
3284633 sexual orientation shouldnt be a barrier to participation in the public sphere
3284634 its a difficult issue for my opponents to try to use against me overtly without a backlash
3284635 but there have been some jabs insinuations and whisper campaigns
3284636 the chances of a republican winning in this district are zero

3284638 there arent many anti gay votes to be found in this election
3284639 we havent heard a lot about it either positive or negative
3284640 polis hasnt made it an issue either which is why it hasnt been raised much
3284641 voters are not responding to jareds desperate attempts to buy this election
3284642 the fact that hes put in so much of his own money has energized our supporters more than ever we want to send a signal that money cant buy you love
3284643 im not running for congress to be wined and dined
3284644 its a sign that the cost of running federal campaigns is skyrocketing and not just at the presidential level
3284645 there are three ways to fund campaigns and none of them is very good
3284646 you can have rich friends you can have support from special interests pacs and lobbyists or you can fund a campaign yourself this race has all three but money cannot buy elections they are won by leg work by going door to door and by demonstrating that you can turn ideas into action
3284647 weve really come back from my initial position clearly third place to where we are right there neck and neck coming down the line
3284648 were never thrilled with government programs here in south carolina but the government does have a responsibility to do things that the private sector wont do for themselves

3284696 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3284697 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3284698 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3284699 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3284700 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3284701 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3284702 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3284817 the way in which the situation in south ossetia has deteriorated is cause for profound concern it is extremely important that all those involved show restraint and play their part in bringing about a political solution

3284819 alexander solzhenitsyn was undoubtedly one of the great authors of our time and a central figure in the story of russias tragic 20th century like no one else he could capture in his books the reality of the stalinist hell that was the soviet union in the books one day in the life of ivan denisovich the first circle and the gulag archipelago he created some of the truly great works of contemporary history and literature on a day like this we have reason to remember him and the great work he did for his russia

3284830 i do not condemn adolf hitler for his actions i forgive him
3284831 you cannot look on another as tromping on your life and bringing about things that you did not ask for that you did not want
3284832 somewhere in your experience there was an allowance and an ability for this to happen
3284833 heres a woman who said she can talk to dead people and thinks hitler can somehow make amends and oh by the way shes also dealing with parents who are abusing their children
3284834 i want to make it clear again that i feel no regret to have lived and died as i did
3284835 my soul was directing my life and it wanted those experiences i do not lay blame on the people who imprisoned me and contributed to my dying

3284850 he also applied sociobiolgy or evolutionary psychology or whatever the pc buzzwords were back then to his later foundation works in a rather simplistic manner chaos theory is important but chaotic behavior does not at all remove the prospect of predictability of the psychodynamic structure cf
3284851 asimov knew the science as the greatest science writer of the 20th century per his agreement with arthur c clarke and knew how to present it all in a compelling narrative
3284852 my concluding praise for asimov is not intended as hyperbole but rather and maybe i should have been explicit a famous compact between asimov and sir arthur c clarke made in a taxicab on i think madison avenue new york city each agreed to tell any interviewer

3284875 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops

3284878 people think its too flattering to me that alexei miller was kind of stalking me when i was in the region
3284879 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
3284880 the united states does not have a clear consistent strategy to promote our long term security interests or our near term energy and economic interests the russians do

3284891 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3284892 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3284893 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3284894 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts

3284904 de sterke opbouw van het werk en het warme coloriet gerealiseerd met aan het impressionisme ontleende toetsen deden mij vermoeden dat het hier om het werk van een grootmeester gaat

3284908 rand gains have been based on unsustainable short money probably carry trade related inflows
3284909 by their nature these are unsustainable and it seems only a matter of time before underlying fundamentals bite we see no reason to change our bearish medium term outlook and reaffirm our r8 50 year end forecast
3284910 we see the rand as very vulnerable to the turnaround in terms of trade
3284911 at present even with sa rates unlikely to shift higher the interest rate
3284912 but carry trade flows are by nature limited in time and may appear less of a bargain to investors now in the medium term we think that they will limit downside rand risks but not prevent a renewed depreciation

3284920 its so instant you get a reaction straight away having spent a lot of time making television recently you hunger for that immediate response
3284921 its great to find out what people think of your material right away rather than months or even years later you can improvise as youre going along which is a real thrill too live work is incredible and when it goes well nothing can beat it
3284922 the only way i can measure it is by the people who come up to us in the street it used to be just cool kids but now its cab drivers and chavs which is great because it means youre appealing to more people
3284923 in the past when i got into taxis the cabbies would always ask who are you now they immediately say the mighty boosh chavs come up to me and say that show is sick it doesnt sound it but apparently thats good
3284924 they dont stab me so thats fine dont touch him hes on telly when you dress the way i do its great to have things like that to save you
3284925 kids really like because there are lots of visual elements to it
3284926 its one of those programmes kids tend to like more than their parents its like with music if a parent says that band is awful their kids will immediately go out and buy all their albums
3284927 stuff like the office is great but people know where its coming from when i was young i used to watch the goodies or spike milligan and i had no idea where it was going we try to create a world that people can get into and love
3284928 my favourite programmes like monty python or the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy conjured up their own worlds once youd entered them you could go where you pleased we aim to do the same thing we put in all sorts of different elements music animation loads of characters
3284929 its never too narrow weve never stopped ourselves doing anything on the boosh
3284930 im sure well do things separately in the future but it really works as a double act
3284931 as individuals were very different and thats crucial to our success
3284932 weve created a universe we love and its fascinating to bring all sorts of different ideas to it difference is very important to us
3284933 and you have to maintain a healthy cynicism about it there is a flavour of the month aspect to it so you have to keep moving on and mutating were never precious about work we never say right thats it that is the crystallised form of the boosh
3284934 its vital to keep changing if we kept doing the same thing wed soon get bored and the audience would say weve seen that next fortunately there are loads of new places to take the boosh weve never had a day where weve said we havent got any ideas today

3284941 i just had this melody and i didnt know what to say and one day i just sang this sex is on fire and i laughed and the other guys are like what are you laughing at
3284942 i thought it was terrible but they were like its good its got a hook i was like fuck off but i ended up writing it theres an element of sex thats expected in our songs so i tried to wrap it all up in one song
3284943 after successfully defending a defamation case brought by one of frances premier television networks philippe karsenty is going on the offensive
3284944 depicting me as a manipulative liar they said i was the same as those who say 9 11 was an inside job
3284945 the colombian government has steadily been opening the colombian economy more and more to u s corporations ever since 1985 the free trade agreement between colombia and the u s is the marriage after a long courtship
3284946 if you were to map out the paramilitary activity in colombia and then superimpose a map of the countrys natural resources they would coincide completely
3284947 in argentina people dont necessarily support the left but they view the left with a certain degree of sympathy because they see them as people who sacrifice themselves for the oppressed in colombia however leftists are seen as kidnappers and extortionists
3284948 it was far safer to be in a union than to be an ordinary citizen in colombia last year
3284949 of the 87 convictions won in union cases since 2001 the judges found that 15 of the murders were related to common crime 10 to crimes of passion and 13 to membership in a guerrilla organization
3284950 there will always be winners and losers the best we can do for the losers is to mitigate their losses
3284951 for example in terms of veterinary vaccinations say that were functioning at 99 safety in other words laboratories are working with extremely high safety standards but instead of 99 they impose 99 9 of course were talking about arbitrary figures but the increase in technology is going to rob part of the profits they are making so you see how technical standards can also become a factor for imposing the price of multinationals and monopolies
3284952 colombia is an example of how the resistance against neoliberalism can be paralyzed by massive violations of human rights through persecuting social movement leaders to permit this model of violence and impunity as has occurred with the negotiation by the colombian government with the paramilitaries is a new model of impunity if we allow this model to be imposed in all of latin america it will constitute an essential element for imposing the ftaa in all of latin america

3284965 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3284966 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3284967 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3284968 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3284969 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3284970 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3284971 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3284972 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3284973 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3284974 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3284975 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3284992 dear all as you may very well have noticed by now we recently announced the cancelation of our appearances at several uk and european festivals due to illness i wanted to make the point that there are genuine reasons for us deciding to do so and also that these were all dates which we had been looking very forward to playing for some time i am sat in hospital writing this from my bed which is where i have been for the past 7 days and indeed will probably be for seven or so more tthe food is rotten and my neighboring inpatient frequently soils his sheets but i guess things could be worse the reason i am here is due to pressure sores on my feet which are common among people who suffer from my disability they come and go but having pretty much caned it since we stared touring the record at the beginning of march my body finally gave in on our recent trip to play at the fuji rock festival in japan where i came off stage and felt the most horrendous fever take over my body one 15 hour flight later and i came off the plane and straight to a amp e where the doctor a stern polish madam put me straight on a ward and advised to my horror that i kiss goodbye to any plans i had for the coming 2 or 3 weeks my immediate feelings were ones of anger and of guilt why did this have to happen in the middle of summer and in the middle of festival season but in truth the warning signs have been there for some time and i would be a fool to ignore them any longer its already been a turbulent year for us and i want to make sure we see the year out as we all intended astoria kooks tour australia america and not to have to pay for it with a lengthy spell on a ward getting skin grafts at this point in time it is impossible to say when we will be back on full fighting form but id say reading and leeds are definitely as good a goal as any i want to apologise to our fans up north who were looking forward to some mystery jets love this weekend at summer sundae and at y not and kendall last weekend too and to those who had planned to see us at haldern and newquay as well believe me i would swap my entro venus drip and shitty hospital lasagna to be there any day of the week anyway its time for my m r i scan whatever that is so i have to go but watch this space x blaine

3285027 ik was vijftien en zat nog op school dus dat was een enorm bedrag
3285028 het probleem met de middelbare school was dat je je tijd niet zelf kunt indelen dagelijks moest ik tijdens kantooruren lessen volgen je klanten verwachten natuurlijk wel dat ze je kunnen bereiken
3285029 colleges worden meerdere keren per week aangeboden zo kan ik kiezen wanneer ik mij met mijn studie bezig houd
3285030 mensen zijn vaak meer bezig met het maken dan met het uitvoeren van plannen ik houd me niet bezig met de lange termijn ik richt me op periodes van pakweg vier weken mijn agenda is ingedeeld in blokken blok a is voor mijn belangrijkste zaken domeinbalie en mijn studie blok b valt in de ochtend en aan het einde van de middag dan doe ik de wat minder belangrijke dingen en blok c bestaat uit de avonden en het weekend met dit schema deel ik mijn tijd in
3285031 dat maakt het ook makkelijker om nee te zeggen of te delegeren je moet nee leren zeggen in het begin belden klanten mij ook voor allerlei relatief gemakkelijke klusjes daar gaat veel tijd in zitten die tussendoorklusjes geef ik nu uit handen
3285032 de uitbreiding van het werknemersbestand is voor mij het belangrijkste wat je adviseurs je ook vertellen ook als ik er niet ben moet het bedrijf door kunnen draaien
3285033 in het begin had ik het gevoel dat ik mijzelf moest bewijzen tegenover mijn eigen personeel
3285034 ik weet niet hoe het is om een kind te hebben maar je onderneming voelt denk ik hetzelfde om ineens anderen hun gang te laten gaan met mijn kindje vond ik ontzettend moeilijk
3285035 de andere genomineerden hebben vooral een bijzonder idee domeinnamen verkopen is natuurlijk geen bijzonder concept maar ik ben wel de enige met veel personeel
3285036 ik vind het hartstikke leuk dat ik blijkbaar bij de beste zes inzendingen hoor en dat ik van die zes economisch het verst ben maar ik vraag me wel af hoe de jury daar mee omgaat het wordt toch een beetje appels met peren vergelijken

3285076 our growth during the quarter was driven by several factors
3285077 larger orders which included both wireline and mobile operators accounted for more than 40 of orders received during the second quarter
3285078 as we anticipated orders for the service gateway increased in the second quarter this platform which was recently recognized by isocore as the dpi industrys first full fledged revenue generating platform continues to be trialed among a growing number of tier 1 and tier 2 operators worldwide we believe that our customers are increasingly recognizing that this true 10g open platform will enable them to both optimize and monetize their ip networks

3285129 we intend to use helicopter models as the platform for the new technology we need a vehicle that can carry cameras and various sensors as well as the control mechanisms a helicopter type unmanned vehicle would be able to hover and would be more stable than an aeroplane for specific operations
3285130 ultimately the intention would be to send several of these unmanned vehicles a swarm out at one time to enable them to cover a very large area in the shortest possible time
3285131 they would be controlled from a command base which could be a jeep roving about the area or possibly airborne but they would also be able to act autonomously for example if one uav detected a signal such as a heat source or a radio pulse from clothing or a mobile phone call it could leave the other vehicles to investigate and then return and relay its information back to base

3285134 legacy search is increasingly becoming an obsolete tool for deadline driven media professionals working in an environment of information overload
3285135 in a sharp contrast idols conceptual search capabilities are unmatched in the industry through the understanding of the interests needs and requirements of users as well as its automatic hyperlinks and alerting features idol delivers unique conceptual search of editorial content regardless of where data resides in the organisation idol will also enable agile development and deployment of new and exciting content rich web services to our business customers and readers plus providing significant benefits from the consolidation of disparate content systems and locations
3285136 recent years have witnessed the transformation of the media market
3285137 professionals in the sector face the challenge of keeping audiences satisfied meeting tight deadlines and keeping abreast of new developments forward thinking organizations like northcliffe media embrace meaning based computing to allow journalists to depart from purely mechanical tasks such as searching for content and enable them to focus on producing high quality stories ultimately giving them a leading edge in the market
3285138 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
3285139 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3285140 at least one from each major family in the series
3285141 there are six long months of work in this research
3285142 some will be against this and some will be for it
3285143 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3285144 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3285145 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are
3285146 but in time people will be able to judge on their own whether we got it right
3285147 that boy had a big dick and gave it to me good
3285148 thats when you get a skinny boy and a big girl and i grab your ass and hold you ins
3285149 i love the public and love to work with people
3285150 i fantasize about having sex with two guys or having sex in public and lately about my pool contractor
3285151 men would always tell me oh youre so beautiful you have such a great body you could be doing movies
3285152 i told them this is as good as it gets to improve care and tower costs which doesnt happen often in medicine
3285153 if you dont implement this i said you might as well close up shop
3285154 were trying to put nearly a million people on these drugs
3285155 the problem is that we dont know what we are doing
3285156 we dont have the evidence that treatments work and we are not investing very much in getting the evidence
3285157 clearly there is a lot in medicine we dont have definitive answers to
3285158 better than the model we use now which is called thinking
3285159 i concluded that medicine was making decisions with an entirely different method from what we would call rational
3285160 he had decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life bringing logic and rationality to the medical system but said he didnt have the math i said why not just take it so he went out and aced all those math courses
3285161 here was a heart surgeon doing math that was weird enough
3285162 hes smart as hell with a towering clarity of thought
3285163 dr eddy is one of my heroes hes sort of the father of health economics and he might be right
3285164 dr eddy challenged the community to prove that we actually had evidence he did a service by stimulating clinical trials
3285165 all the doctors were trying to estimate the same thing and they all gave different numbers
3285166 ive spent 25 years proving that what we lovingly call clinical judgment is woefully outmatched by the complexities of medicine
3285167 go to one doctor and get one answer go to another and get a different one
3285168 you dont have to hire an expert to lie you can just find one who truly believes the number you want
3285169 how is a poor patient supposed to decide among those
3285170 because there are no definitive answers you are at the whim of where you are and who you talk to
3285171 if you drive one and a half hours down the road to indianapolis there is almost no brachytherapy
3285172 doctors often assume that they know what a patient wants leading them to recommend the treatment they know best
3285173 there is no question that the economic interests of the physician enter into the decision
3285174 there really isnt good evidence to suggest that one treatment is better than another
3285175 when there is more than one medical option people mistakenly think that the more aggressive procedure is the best
3285176 as a nation we always want the best the most recent technology
3285177 we spend a huge amount developing it and we get a big increase in supply
3285178 combine that with americans demand to be treated immediately and it is a cauldron for overuse and inappropriate use
3285179 the investment in health care in the u s is just not paying off
3285180 there is a massive amount of spending on things that really dont help patients and even put them at greater risk everyone thats informed on the topic knows it but it is such a scary thing to discuss that people are not willing to talk about it openly
3285181 a lot of things we absolutely believe at the moment based on our intuition are ultimately absolutely wrong
3285182 the popular version of evidence based medicine is about proving things
3285183 but it is really about transparency being clear about what we know and dont know
3285184 patients typically dont understand that they have options and even if they do they often wildly exaggerate the benefits of surgery and wildly minimize the chances of harm
3285185 the archimedes model is just fabulous in the validation studies
3285186 one thing not yet adequately embraced by evidence based medicine is what to do for someone with diabetes hypertension heart disease and depression
3285187 but we fail to pick the right ones consistently so we have misdirected utilization and a great deal of waste
3285188 cardiovascular disease is the worst complication of diabetes and what people die of
3285189 the wright brothers plane were off the sand and flying to raleigh
3285190 they can see what happens to such things as the complications suffered by diabetics the lost time from work the amount of angina or the rate of heart attacks the number of deaths and the cost of new employees if one dies
3285191 our mission is that in 10 years no one will make an important decision in health care without first asking what does archimedes say
3285192 go to one doctor and get one answer go to another and get a different one
3285193 ser a una excelente soluci n dada las nuevas aportaciones h dricas que supondr a para la comunitat valenciana
3285194 es hora de poner en marcha una segunda fase que permita la conexi n de zonas excedentarias con las deficitarias mediantes trasvases
3285195 fuimos los socialistas valencianos quienes defendimos la necesidad de los trasvases en base a la solidaridad de los territorios y as se aprob
3285196 los socialistas vamos a solucionar un problemas hist rico de los valencianos porque creemos de verdad en su progreso y no como hace el pp que ni invierte ni deja invertir mientras trata de manipular a los valencianos con mentiras

3285199 vital para el sector tur stico y la poblaci n
3285200 el pp sigue con sus enfrentamientos internos ya que los populares aragoneses se oponen al trasvase del ebro y tratan que tambi n la sociedad se enfrente en vez de aportar soluciones
3285201 canal 9 y de la fundaci n agua y progreso pero aun est por ver que han hecho para aportar m s agua al sistema
3285202 la suprima de un plumazo por ser un elemento m s de derroche y propaganda del pp alimentada con el dinero de los impuestos que pagamos los valencianos

3285222 we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are
3285223 of course if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature

3285233 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3285245 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
3285246 you have to win eight gold medals to get noticed he wins a gold medal and everyone says one down seven to go people have no idea how hard it is to get up on the blocks and swim out of his mind like that
3285247 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3285248 we gave our best effort if we came up short hes not going to be looked at as a guy who was on a relay that lost or that he came up short nah hes an amazing athlete probably the best ever in this sport regardless of what happens here hes going to go down as that
3285249 i jumped in the air and almost fell in the pool
3285250 i was thinking if there was anybody on this team or in the world who could do it it would be jason who could pull this off i was pounding on the blocks saying aaaaah come on we looked up at the board and it was phenomenal i dont think anybody in the world could have done a better job without a doubt
3285251 we were the favorites in both of those years this year we were actually considered the underdogs in past olympics it just wasnt attainable theres no way i was going to catch a guy whos two seconds ahead of me
3285252 when i flipped at 50 meters and saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder until about two minutes before that the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then i changed i said you know what this is ridiculous its the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going to go out in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got supercharged and just took it from there it was unreal
3285253 he got his hand on the wall and i got chills seeing their reactions and how happy they were

3285259 when a soldier is due for retirement it is the office of the chief of personnel and administration which handles it ceases to be a matter of pgb
3285260 therefore the responsibility of the welfare of those intending to retire how they get their retirement package rests with cpa
3285261 since we arrived at kakiri we have been with no food no medicine we live in a dilapidated hall with no facilities we look after ourselves

3285263 we have done a noble duty of protecting the president whom we know appreciates our service we want to be sent off honourably
3285264 if our concerns are not addressed by those in charge i think the president should be informed through the media since we are not allowed to go to him
3285265 if the alleged sodomy is consensual why was i the only one being charged this is political persecution
3285266 their greed for power has made them capable of undermining national institutions and democracy in the country
3285267 it proves that they are facing a moral crisis and a crisis of confidence
3285268 the malaysian government appears to be manipulating the legal system to shore up support for its continued rule and undermine the opposition
3285269 however this time around the malaysian public is no longer amused or titillated by this sordid allegation rather they are disgusted
3285270 but by allowing the situation to degenerate so far he is indirectly responsible
3285271 they are always wanting to charge anwar and he has been going in and out of the police stations and the courts
3285272 but what they dont realise is that people like us are carrying a heavy burden
3285273 i earn about rm800 900 a month barely above the official poverty line how on earth are we to survive when the oil price hike has triggered a round of price increases now i hear even the bus fares might rise things were more tolerable during the mahathir era
3285274 people from all over the country are coming here now
3285275 there are even people coming here from sabah and sarawak
3285276 its not a smart move politically because it now makes it easier for anwar at permatang pauh people will punish the bn heavily because of this episode

3285285 the ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups
3285286 it went by real fast it was like a blur
3285287 if you ask every guy that passes by right now what we see out of chad
3285288 its that the ball comes out on time receivers turned their heads and it almost hit them in the face a couple of times its amazing to see that on day 1
3285289 its instinct of the game thats what he brings to us and today was kind of evident not to disrespect the other guys that were in there but chad brings a certain presence everybody had a little swagger on the other side of the ball and it was good to see
3285290 he brings that veteran leadership and you can definitely see it in the huddle weve been waiting for that and looking for that
3285291 as a competitor you want to play but i trust what theyre doing
3285292 its different but we need chad to get into things as quickly as possible
3285293 the only way it works is if you have good people and good professionals and all three of those guys understand its tough there are a lot of emotions involved ive been there before
3285294 weve seen an awful lot of a couple of guys here of three players so we can see a little bit less maybe of the three players there as we get on in this we obviously have to get chad pennington work it might be a little bit dominant in here early
3285295 it did give me a little bit of a foundation
3285296 some things are a little bit different trying to recall something from eight years ago is a little bit difficult ive got a long way to go but im excited about the progress
3285297 i pitched good enough to give us a chance to win but im not really happy with it
3285298 we lost its our fourth game in a row the seasons getting shorter so its not what we want right now
3285299 maybe the results dont look it giving up four runs in eight innings but i thought he pitched a heck of a game
3285300 felt there was enough strength and flexibility its just a matter of tolerating the pain
3285301 our approach as offensive linemen is the same no matter whos back there
3285302 in that sense nothings changed but what hes done on the field speaks for itself hes a valuable player an important part of the equation and well treat him that way
3285303 i made the suggestion that he waits until friday when we get home so its in front of us
3285304 that way we have a chance to look at him
3285305 everything has been addressed about sundays game the day before the day before and the day before we take care of it
3285306 justin christian has had a lot of success off of left handers for us and has played very well
3285307 justin christian has had a lot of success off of left handers for us and has played very well
3285308 you guys ask me these questions before we have a chance to talk as a group and to my general manager but i liked what i saw today four out of the five innings he was very good you guys are asking me to make decisions without talking to anybody hes in our rotation i dont mean to get irritated but we talk as a group as an organization we talk about whats best for all of our pieces and weve been in here two minutes im just saying that hes in our rotation today
3285309 justin christian has had a lot of success off of left handers for us and has played very well
3285310 justin christian has had a lot of success off of left handers for us and has played very well
3285311 i want him as a starter and so does everyone else including him and that is what we are working toward and we need him there now there is no question about it you dont have a guy with a 100 mile per hour fastball and keep him as a setup guy you just dont do that you have to be an idiot to do that
3285312 the mistake was already made last year switching him to the bullpen out of panic or whatever i had no say in it last year and i wouldnt have allowed it that was done last year so now we have to catch up it has to be done on a schedule so we dont rush him
3285313 jobas staying in the bullpen right now thats where were at putting him in the rotation is not something thats going to happen here early on and hank knows that weve talked about it i dont know what set him off
3285314 if you had bet on the hughes and kennedy doing great out of the gate it wouldnt necessarily be a safe bet but were betting on them in the long term not necessarily in the short term its way too early to start making judgments on anything
3285315 why have this guy only throw x innings when he can throw twice that as a starter
3285316 justin christian has had a lot of success off of left handers for us and has played very well
3285317 justin christian has had a lot of success off of left handers for us and has played very well
3285318 justin christian has had a lot of success off of left handers for us and has played very well
3285319 we are very sorry for the delay phone back later
3285320 the latest price reductions are pretty much in line with the fall in wholesale prices
3285321 unless retailers intend to hang on to some of the reductions thats the way fuel prices are heading there is absolutely no reason why the other supermarkets are not meeting asdas prices
3285322 we give all our customers the same price on fuel whether your in bangor or bournemouth
3285323 we dont hide behind average or local pricing and we would encourage our competitors to do the same
3285324 we continue to review prices daily and we will be reducing petrol and diesel by up to 2p from tomorrow to ensure we provide customers with the best possible value for their fuel on a local basis
3285325 if the price of oil goes down the consumer council wants to see that reflected in lower prices at the petrol pumps for consumers
3285326 i havent raced all that often at the ulster so i suppose i cant complain
3285327 that was a good day for me but i would like to improve on it
3285328 there are some pikeys out there putting some new tarmac down at turn 10 apparently are they out of the way yet
3285329 its a fairly mercenary system here and you always had the impression he could buy his way out of trouble
3285330 justin christian has had a lot of success off of left handers for us and has played very well
3285331 it is so clear what is happening we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war
3285332 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3285333 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3285334 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3285335 all the russian troops who arrived by ship have crossed over to zugdidi
3285336 the city is deserted but there are no russians here
3285337 its not south ossetia only but the whole of georgia
3285338 we heard statements saying that the russian railroad troops that entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there for a humanitarian mission now we know the truth these forces were there to aid a russian invasion
3285339 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3285340 ja helemaal we zitten net voor de tweede keer de herhaling te kijken op tv rijnmond t gaat nu wel kriebelen

3285365 the russians are looking for an excuse to kill georgians
3285366 generally when a country is being invaded you dont call on it to show restraint
3285367 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
3285368 would kicking russia out of the g 8 have stopped this invasion
3285369 i dont see how those two are related that is the test of leadership are you proposing things that can advance american interests
3285370 to condemn russias aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3285371 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3285372 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3285373 anytime you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3285374 there are some things i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown
3285375 and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support there are some good things too i take the good with the bad with that i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3285376 i think we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3285377 were never thrilled with government programs here in south carolina but the government does have a responsibility to do things that the private sector wont do for themselves
3285378 sexual orientation shouldnt be a barrier to participation in the public sphere
3285379 its a difficult issue for my opponents to try to use against me overtly without a backlash
3285380 but there have been some jabs insinuations and whisper campaigns
3285381 the chances of a republican winning in this district are zero
3285382 the deciding factor will be whether 5 million is enough to swing the district
3285383 there arent many anti gay votes to be found in this election
3285384 we havent heard a lot about it either positive or negative
3285385 polis hasnt made it an issue either which is why it hasnt been raised much
3285386 voters are not responding to jareds desperate attempts to buy this election
3285387 the fact that hes put in so much of his own money has energized our supporters more than ever we want to send a signal that money cant buy you love
3285388 im not running for congress to be wined and dined
3285389 its a sign that the cost of running federal campaigns is skyrocketing and not just at the presidential level
3285390 there are three ways to fund campaigns and none of them is very good
3285391 you can have rich friends you can have support from special interests pacs and lobbyists or you can fund a campaign yourself this race has all three but money cannot buy elections they are won by leg work by going door to door and by demonstrating that you can turn ideas into action
3285392 weve really come back from my initial position clearly third place to where we are right there neck and neck coming down the line
3285393 following recent media reports of significant civilian casualties isaf has now concluded a thorough investigation of the claim and has evidence that those killed were insurgents
3285394 anybody who wants to beat me up for this they should have at it
3285395 the truth is you cant possibly beat me up more than ive already beaten myself up
3285396 i was taken in by his magnificent rhetoric and now i think hes treacherous
3285397 its an insult greater than i could ever imagine that he would do this to that magnificent family he has
3285398 he was trying to relieve himself of the horror of what he had done almost saying had i known that she was in the last stages of her life i would never have done it
3285399 what that demonstrates is that he had no love for his wife because you dont do that to someone you love he has soiled her
3285400 i dont think that candidates private lives are particularly relevant to how theyll perform in office
3285401 if we rated our presidents by the quality of their private lives youd have to say that nixon and bush are two of the best presidents we ever had
3285402 john edwards knows what the rules are he knew at the time he ran for president that he was having an affair and he should have known that was going to come out it was reckless for him to run for president under those terms i feel very disappointed in him his campaign the judgment he showed
3285403 it would have been better if hed issued an apology and just gone away
3285404 tarnishes the moral credibility hes built through his work on poverty and it also raises questions about his overall judgment
3285405 they are using half people karolyi said after the tiny chinese womens team grabbed a significant lead over the americans in team competition sunday night
3285406 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
3285407 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like he said
3285408 you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
3285409 they understood it a 10 is perfect that is good for the sport what is this system they say it cannot be manipulated it can be manipulated
3285410 im alan yeah i just got into an argument with my drunk wife
3285411 i saw them as a tribe that i wanted to study
3285412 and i ended up writing this book story of my life which is about a group of girls five or six friends coming to new york and conquering or failing to conquer the city
3285413 it seemed like a very half assed confession and i think it was unchivalrous of him to basically say that he wasnt in love with her i think he has some more explaining to do although on the other hand the sooner this is all behind us the better
3285414 i think shes a wonderful girl and she has a good heart and shes a good person i still wish her well
3285415 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a home wrecker she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over
3285416 i can chat all night long but im not the guy who goes ok back to my room
3285417 nbc is spending more than 1 billion to broadcast the olympic games to the u s they believe footage available on other web sites would take away their audience
3285418 expands to any footage filmed within the accredited area or interviews conducted within the accredited area
3285419 an irish person via a mobile phone and they happened to be in an official olympic car we cannot play that interview outside of ireland
3285420 realistically this means we need to block all live streams radio and television because we cannot monitor all of the streams 24 hours
3285421 its not even common for the olympics no other sporting event in the world requires this level of restrictions including the 2004 games
3285422 were making more of these olympics available to american audiences by far than any olympics in history
3285423 all government is evil and trying to improve it is largely a waste of time
3285424 we believe any decision at this time on whether he should remain majority leader is premature and wrong
3285425 this analysis was not undermined in any way by politicians
3285426 i love the ronsons theyre close to me and i respect all the work they do
3285427 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3285428 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties
3285429 draft created on may 31 2008 at 5 30 am
3285430 but the oakland as are proud of having them be a part of team usa
3285431 the experience they get over there will be worth it pitching in that environment in high pressure situations will be great for their development
3285432 hes grown into his body and his confidence has jumped his body language looks like he belongs in the big leagues brett also carries himself with a ton of confidence and his command is phenomenal he can place his fastball where he wants and he competes hes got some bulldog in him
3285433 of course youd want to play for your country but its even better to get an opportunity to play in the big leagues
3285434 we have an offday at home and maybe we can relax and get away from baseball
3285435 come back with a little revived spirit on tuesday and get back on track
3285436 but weve got to start swinging the bats better thats the main thing
3285437 remember in american idol season 5 when that guy who looked like me came back for the season finale and i surprised him by coming out and singing dont
3285438 it was just the empty space under the power lines nothing was growing there but it was our playground
3285439 i guess thats where everything started for gio its like one of those movies going from there to the big leagues
3285440 he went from nothing to this its hard to believe it we played with tires and cardboard for bases threw them down under the big electrical poles if you hit it left or right youd hit a window and youd be out so we all learned to hit it up the middle if we had a rock to hit and a broomstick to swing we were playing
3285441 i remember he threw it once in khoury league youth baseball and you could see the ball bite straight down from center field
3285442 everyone said thats it never mind there was no way anyone could hit it
3285443 i remember throwing the curveball to my cousin and it started at his face and almost hit him in the foot
3285444 he dropped his glove and said forget it i dont want to catch
3285445 im telling you i cant wait to put on that white uniform
3285446 wherever i go home i get a warm welcome from everyone
3285447 they treat me special but not because im a baseball player but they know me they know my personality they know ill talk to anyone
3285448 he can meet you today and he wants to try to help you theres a bum in hialeah and gio is his best friend everyone who sees him has to give him money and food because of gio he goes over and above
3285449 whatevers in my pockets whatever is in the car i can have 10 bucks and be starving but i think well i have a home i can go to so i give it to him
3285450 ive told everyone if they pass joe under the bridge at 103rd make sure to give him money or food or books because he loves to read
3285451 i dont know anyone in naples my friends are here in this block my aunt is in the next block everyone here has helped me this is my support
3285452 it feels like that community is with me forever it has to be
3285453 nothing that exists is absolutely worthy of love so we must love what does not exist
3285454 how difficult it is to be palestinian and how difficult it is for a palestinian to be a writer or a poet how can he achieve literary freedom in such slavish conditions and how can he preserve the literariness of literature in such brutal times

3285485 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3285486 there were some paf civilians as well travelling in the vehicle we are trying to ascertain exactly how many were inside
3285487 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack or a roadside bomb
3285488 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge
3285489 the guy picked him up on wyse road and went to a couple of spots throughout the city and he was confronting him about an alleged relationship between him and a female
3285490 halifax is a port city and we need to entertain our guests
3285491 no wonder there arent any americans coming here anymore why should they theres nothing here for them we only have one strip club and its not even in halifax its out in the outskirts of dartmouth so we shouldnt even expect tourists to come here
3285492 i have to put up the money first instead of just hoping it will fall from the sky if i cant reach my financial goals then im not going to run
3285493 we need to protect our public transit drivers taxi cab and school bus and city transport drivers by making stiffer sentences for attacks on them and give them more power to act in self defence

3285495 i know hes been involved in politics for some time
3285496 hell bring his issues and platform forward and the public will choose whom they wish to have in place
3285497 as a result of the process with the mayors roundtable on violence some of the issues being promoted would certainly take us back many steps and they certainly wouldnt be ones i would be promoting
3285498 it takes everybody living in and around a lake setting to make sure that their lake stays clean by not polluting
3285499 the quantum leap is that people believe automatically when theres fecal coliform in fresh water that there must have been some sort of sewage overflow
3285500 but we are very very firm in suggesting that lakes may be contaminated for various reasons at any time
3285501 with heavy rain each drop of rain that falls on buildings roads and driveways ends up through the storm water systems into our lakes
3285502 so what i believe were experiencing is a very natural spike in an urban area
3285503 dog and bird feces have been known to raise the fecal coliform level of the lakes substantially enough to have this kind of spike

3285510 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3285511 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3285512 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3285513 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3285514 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3285515 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3285516 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3285517 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff

3285528 id love to play more tests for australia and that remains a big goal but theres a lot of work to do before i think about that valentine said
3285529 my immediate goal is to win the starting job for the western force and hopefully play some really good consistent rugby next year

3285537 well jen if you hadnt been out carousing about town getting drunk off of stand up buzzed off of improv and high off of fringe maybe you would have had a little more time to pay attention to the needs of your wife and home you know the place that takes you in regardless year after year the place that first saw your potential and nurtured your love of performance
3285538 obviously very pleasing to go with a win with a slightly different side different captain and a great finish for us
3285539 everything went right for pietersen probably not in the script was for him to get out and not hit the winning runs
3285540 whats been nice is hes confident and simple in his approach and it hasnt affected him in the short term and so it bodes well for the future
3285541 the headlines should be about marco as he had another great game
3285542 as long as we can keep all our players we can do well in this league
3285543 the manner of telling the story is a provocative and artful blend of music dance and plot and the music and the dancing are superb
3285544 in the score there is the drive the bounce the restlessness and the sweetness of our town
3285545 the story appealed to societys undercurrent of rebellion from authority that surfaced in 1950s films like rebel without a cause
3285546 west side story took this one step further by combining the classic and the hip
3285547 robbins energetic choreography and bernsteins grand score accentuated the satiric hard edged lyrics of sondheim and laurents capture of the angry voice of urban youth
3285548 was for the audience to rediscover west side story again as if for the first time as well as to bring it to a new generation who have never seen the production on stage
3285549 our mantra is keeping it youthful because that is the energy of the show but musically its very much in its original form
3285550 a new fresh feel and look with new sets and costumes to give a very urban look to it we play with the tempos a little bit because we absorb faster we move faster now but its all meant to take the audience into a timeless era one that is not a tired remake of the fifties
3285551 i have chosen to go as high energy and youth orientated as possible to really create an atmosphere in which the violence of the youth is able to take the journey of racism and hate into a very natural realistic place
3285552 my goal is for the audience to feel the emotion of the piece thats all important
3285553 you may well know how the story ends but i still want that to feel like a shock for the audience to be so caught up in the emotion that they dont expect that to happen and they dont want this love to be thwarted
3285554 he was like a mentor to me and it was a great honour 11 years later to be asked to direct a version of west side story at la scala in milan which was my first job as a director i learned from watching mr robbins that dance is everything to west side story it carries character emotion plot
3285555 if you removed the original choreography it would not be west side story
3285556 reminds us of our first love its about first love
3285557 after 50 years it continues to be relevant because we still have conflicts it could be in any country and in any conflict and there is a beautiful lesson to it
3285558 we feel a responsibility passing on this piece of work its not a job its a passion
3285559 i cannot nominate myself but if i am nominated i will be available
3285560 those who are interested in my return will nominate me if i am nominated i will serve if i am not nominated i will support whoever is nominated the question you should have asked is if i am nominated will i accept and the answer i am giving you is yes if i am nominated i will be available

3285684 thats the first time really weve seen each other for a couple of weeks
3285685 its been a little bit hard but to see her so happy and to get the gold medal its been more than worth it
3285686 i mean its hard at the time to deal with criticism and i copped a lot of it in athens
3285687 its really difficult but its made me a much stronger person and has made this performance much sweeter
3285688 i sensed in the end just a little bit of wanting to get to the wall and grab hold of it at the end

3285704 industrial growth is stoking fuel and energy consumption but it can hardly account for the entire 50 per cent increase industrial growth was roughly 6 7 per cent with fuel consumption rising by more or less the same margin which leaves higher prices to account for the remainder
3285705 the preliminary gdp data for the second quarter indicates that the farming sector grew by just two per cent that showing means it is still reeling especially livestock breeding and unable to meet domestic demand individual consumption is closely interlinked with the import of consumer goods and stimulates its growth
3285706 a large number of bulgarian businesses have launched from a very low base and we are vulnerable in this environment of energy inefficiency most of the growth momentum is coming from sectors like metallurgy and transport and less so from sectors like services which are less resource intensive

3285764 house to house inquiries are continuing in the vicinity of the crime scene and the search of the scene is ongoing looking for possible weapons used in the attack
3285765 we are using chinese media outlets internet websites and community contacts to try and build up a lifestyle profile of the victims and identify the last sightings of the couple alive
3285766 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children
3285767 its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3285768 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3285769 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile
3285770 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3285771 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3285772 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3285773 i think i m delivering pizza because my parents are alcoholics
3285774 but the other key is the product the retail concept ties in very much to the product
3285775 the idea is that while people love to come to retail stores and they do it all the time what they really appreciate the most is that undivided personal attention
3285776 apparently a lot of them like what theyre seeing in the stores they like the experience and they go back to buy the products
3285777 everyone is free to use the internet and do anything they want within reason
3285778 whenever we ask consumers to cite a great retail experience the apple store is the first store they mention
3285779 basically everything about it works the people who work there are cool and knowledgeable they have the answers you want and can sell you what you need customers appreciate that even the fact that theyll e mail you a receipt makes you feel like youre in a store just a little bit further ahead of everyone else
3285780 these stores are going to become iconic places that people go to see when they come to new york
3285781 rockefeller center as for ms jade whose modeling career is advancing she has yet to buy a computer from the apple store but she is still welcome to check her e mail and stay as long as she likes
3285782 are abundantly clear throughout the pages of the old testament
3285783 women exchanged their natural function for an unnatural and abnormal one
3285784 etliche menschen wurden verletzt und liegen auf der stra e
3285785 ob sie durchgeht oder nicht h ngt jetzt ausschlie lich von russland ab
3285786 you cant ask anyone to make decisions for you because its just too heavy there is a lot of rush to treatment when what you really need is time to research and think about how you want to approach this take your time christina there is no rush use your cancer to learn and grow and as a force to work for you you will make it the success and drive you have had in your career will be the same strengths you will use to win over this nasty disease and i am here if you want to talk to someone who was there
3285787 my own people used to say to me you speak like a white woman what does that even mean anyway everyone has their way of speaking and living their life
3285788 no one should be judging and assuming that because im black i have to speak in that hip hop way thats something i prefer not to do
3285789 erin and i are thrilled and cant wait to meet our newest addition
3285790 years ago you got the spontaneous creativity that happened between live musicians
3285791 you cannot get that from machines or producers working on their computers
3285792 the taglines are a part of a way to honor this being the 60th anniversary of the prime time emmys by featuring some of tvs most unforgettable classic lines from the past 60 years recited by some of entertainments biggest stars
3285793 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3285794 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3285795 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
3285796 hai capito che questo non un test per temi infetti
3285797 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3285798 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3285799 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3285800 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3285801 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3285802 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3285803 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3285804 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3285805 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3285806 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3285807 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3285808 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3285809 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience
3285810 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3285811 i liked the fact that i got to see something blow up
3285812 hunting and fishing with dad has helped me prosper quickly
3285813 my father was my biggest inspiration he has always been behind me
3285814 let me explain the problem science has with jesus christ
3285815 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
3285816 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
3285817 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
3285818 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
3285819 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
3285820 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
3285821 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
3285822 who created them there is still no answer suddenly the
3285823 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
3285824 have you ever actually felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
3285825 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
3285826 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
3285827 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
3285828 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
3285829 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
3285830 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
3285831 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
3285832 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
3285833 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
3285834 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
3285835 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
3285836 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
3285837 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
3285838 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelled the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
3285839 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
3285840 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
3285841 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
3285842 scargills talk came after many in the mining community had expressed dismay at the camps anti coal position particularly slogans such as no new coal and leave it in the ground
3285843 our children deserve the same standard of living that we have
3285844 i felt very disappointed in the conservative party because i believed in their vision i believed in what stephen harper had to say
3285845 the report left the impression that there was something dreadfully wrong here with this money in money out campaign and i did not wish to be identified as a person who was doing something wrong
3285846 what happened in the riot is one hundredth of what should happen what will happen
3285847 this is just crazy talk from someone who is pissed off
3285848 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3285849 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3285850 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3285851 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3285852 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3285853 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3285854 on saturday the cops overreact and shoot three young guys who did nothing wrong on sunday they do nothing while this happens
3285855 i heard my brother say what are you doing to my brother and then i heard gunshots
3285856 my brother tried to help me and now hes dead
3285857 i feel very bad i feel very upset and we will get to the bottom of what happened
3285858 because of an idiotic move by one officer the bums and the gangs get inflamed and then the cops are powerless to do anything
3285859 you mean that air over there is worse than this air over here
3285860 i just need five minutes in my house i need to go to my house
3285861 one would think from this kind of incident youd have more
3285862 this asbestos and how close we were and how much asbestos is on our lawn and around the house
3285863 we didnt know where to go because we were shaking
3285864 erin was a big tough mountain of a man who enjoyed the outdoors
3285865 he was a true warrior and just the person you would want beside you in a firefight this was his fifth operational tour and his third tour in afghanistan
3285866 he was a good friend to have on your side of things
3285867 he was always a bit of a rebel the army was his cause
3285868 i would rather not talk to you i have just lost my youngest son
3285869 i need to go far from this fighting to sperwan village which is safe now
3285870 are out there amongst the population in the most difficult parts of these two districts zhari and panjwai largely to do what we can to increase the peoples confidence that the government is delivering the services for them and one of those services is clearly security
3285871 they are in combat outposts because these are difficult areas where the insurgents have a reasonable grip
3285872 what they tend to do is fire a few harassing rounds and then they will disappear into the woodwork
3285873 in this particular case it happened at 5 40 this morning the combat outpost was engaged in a classic shoot and scoot fashion and unfortunately mcpl doyle was killed by a direct hit on the outpost
3285874 that combat outpost is where he would have wanted to serve the most himself he would not be happy back in camp he was out there doing his job with the soldiers
3285875 there was a time when i probably did feel a little too much pressure
3285876 now ive embraced it it was one of the things dawn coe jones taught me after the first couple of canadian opens i played in people want you to do well theyre not trying to add to your pressure embrace it and use it to your advantage
3285877 when we were talking about where the tournament might go two things came to mind the hunt club in 94 and royal ottawa in 2000 i thought the fans in this city really came out to support us and i encouraged cn to come here
3285878 the cn canadian womens open is a major too because i am canadian
3285879 its tough to play on home soil we always have great crowds and theyre always pulling for the canadian players for us it feels like a major i doesnt need to be classified as a major by the lpga
3285880 this tournament for me last year was my stepping stone because i finally broke into the top 10 i havent had a top 10 this year but ive played more consistently i just havent shot any really low numbers
3285881 my career is progressing slowly and it always has done that of course im a little anxious to play a little better
3285882 im going to have to pretend its not an olympic final because it could be really nerve wracking im going to pretend im back home in ontario
3285883 i dont want to get overwhelmed but i just showed i belong there so im not going to be scared
3285884 my mom and my dad and my sister were all there and they started flipping out
3285885 coach lori sippel said to us before the game get em bloody type of thing
3285886 we went up there swinging that was our mentality for today
3285887 its just a totally different team in every single way possible
3285888 we knew we wanted to come out swinging today and put a lot of runs up if it comes down to runs for and runs against at the end of round robin portion of the eight country tournament we want to be on the right side of those runs four
3285889 it allowed me to fight through what i was fighting through
3285890 it allows you to completely relax and focus on what you need to do without the pressure that one run might be the ball game
3285891 chinese taipei was scrappy they did a good job on some good pitches fouling them off id throw a good pitch and theyd just get a piece and the at bat would go on and on and on it was really fun to be part of some of those at bats

3285893 builders continue to manage their supply levels as they face higher inventories combined with recent price escalation and strong competition with the resale market
3285894 if youre in the market for a brand new home in either of albertas two major cities youre likely to be seeing some good deals lately
3285895 buyers in alberta are finally seeing some good opportunities in the real estate market
3285896 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3285897 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack or a roadside bomb
3285898 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge
3285899 ich habe keine die l sung aber ich bewundere das problem

3285901 a decision was made to remove the dryers out of the blue and we werent asked about it they were ripped out just like that
3285902 we couldnt believe it especially as the rent has gone up normally the council would ask for comments first but this seemed to have been hurried through without thought for any of us
3285903 the council are really going over the top on this they say that dryers cost 415 annually to rent but that sounds overblown when you could buy the dryers for that sort of money
3285904 i will be pursuing this with the housing directorate at the council this is not the sort of service our tenants deserve
3285905 all tenants were written to on july 2 confirming that the tumble dryers were to be removed and that washing lines could be put up in their place for the convenience of some tenants who might like to use them
3285906 i did the same thing as i did in the summer but i dont think it is as bad as before this time i dont think the ligament is torn
3285907 maybe i will be back in a couple of weeks its too soon to say but i will have a scan maybe on wednesday because the ankle is swollen at the moment
3285908 there are more tackles in the championship but this was unlucky because i stepped on his foot and then fell
3285909 its frustrating because this is a difficult season and i want to get back in the premier
3285910 but i am looking forward to the season i am happy at reading it is a good team
3285911 there are few signs the slowdown as yet bottomed out

3285914 tingginya harga listrik serta keterbatasan pasokan listrik paling mengancam sektor industri ritel dan perkantoran padahal ketiga sektor ini memegang peranan penting jalannya perekonomian kita
3285915 misalkan satu supermarket besar seperti carrefour atau hypermarket ada 2 ribu lampu lalu dikalikan 36 watt karena itu saving 30 persen itu cukup besar belum untuk satu perkantoran yang lebih besar dari ini
3285916 there were some fantastic collisions in the game real contact proper proper football proper hard face to face football and also a word to the referee who kept it absolutely controlled
3285917 theres no reason to be dissatisfied after dipping our toe in the championship i dont think weve got anything to be frightened of the players have got to go and show the ability theyve got
3285918 why worry ourselves with who were facing or teams that we might go up against
3285919 they are opposition to us and that is what any team is you dont look at the label or what they did in the previous week they are the opposition 11 people that we want to pit our wits against
3285920 there are names bigger and brands bigger than everybody else weve got to go out and prove our worth
3285921 it was a tough game but reading are a championship team and were a championship team so weve got to compete with them thats the reality of the situation
3285922 i could see a danger when they broke forward and we lacked a bit in the second half down to fitness i think but that will come with matches
3285923 its nice to come out and not get beaten but its also nice to win

3285938 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3285939 this is an issue that we had settled and he tsvangirai is also suggesting that he must be given full authority to appoint any new government

3285968 im disgusted and annoyed that a spanish cyclist has been the first athlete to be found positive of doping at the olympic games
3285969 im very angry that it is cycling that is in the headlines of the worlds media despite all of the crackdowns we have been doing
3285970 moreno is the third spanish athlete to test positive for third generation epo also known as cera after moises duenas nevado and manuel beltran did at last months tour de france
3285971 any statements coming out of the spanish federation dealing with doping i would treat with a certain amount of skepticism
3285972 because the spanish federation have constantly defended athletes who have been involved in doping cases they have been light in the way theyve treated doping cases how many spanish athletes have been caught in spain i dont think anybody has been charged under that law
3285973 puerto has been badly handled by the authorities from the outset they keep hiding behind the spanish judicial system
3285974 there doesnt seem to be a real will to go after the athletes involved it shows that there is a cultural problem in spain if so many cyclists are ready to take doping products
3285975 im aware of parents of junior cyclists who have purchased doping products for their sons its a shocking thing to say
3285976 the spanish cycling federation tests junior racers and eight out of 10 of the guys they have tested are approaching the limit and these are juniors

3286014 he had a pop at me before the last dive i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do
3286015 thats just thomas hes over nervous thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform
3286016 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens
3286017 certainly not so much for me im a little bit older than tom so i can take things on the chin a bit easier
3286018 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3286019 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city
3286020 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used
3286021 we did our best to create a rendering that would look like the shot was taken live

3286023 youre talking at two or three removes from the real power
3286024 they have to talk to the people who do control this
3286025 its a very clear message to the insurgents that there will be no other chance
3286026 i knew if i tried my best id win it
3286027 so far this is the highlight but i hope theres more to come
3286028 obviously i felt the pressure but i kept my mind free during the competition
3286029 were not trying to put on a show were trying to play the game the way we know how to play
3286030 usa softball plays the game hard plays the game aggressively playing it smart and thats my concern
3286031 if it was a great show i hope we have more great shows throughout the week
3286032 my goal is hey feed off the energy if they dont want me to succeed man im going to exactly do the opposite
3286033 bob plays better when people are going against him so im looking forward to the match
3286034 if we go out and happen to win tomorrow its going to be like usa basketball vs
3286035 by the end of the games we will have been here for five weeks
3286036 its a mistake to think that the games are easy because it is sports
3286037 none of us are experts on sports rules so we must prepare ourselves
3286038 they have all been telling me what a huge achievement winning gold is
3286039 i realise that but frankly the enormity of the goodwill generated has caught me by surprise

3286042 it would be a mistake to assume that all communications with government lawyers no matter what their origins purpose and subject matter fall within the ambit of the states legal professional privilege advice taken from lawyers on issues of law reform and public policy does not necessarily attract the privilege especially in the context of the oia and legal advice to government courts need to be on their guard as they evidently had not been in the instant case concentrating instead on issues of waiver of privilege against any inclination of lawyers to expand the ambit of legal professional privilege beyond what is necessary and justifiable to fulfil its legal purposes

3286078 this type of behaviour is a crucial part of emo ideology
3286079 of course there are emo teens who just listen to their music but our actions are not directed at them but rather at those who also hurt themselves commit suicide and promote those acts
3286080 suicide is not a symptom of emo culture i work with other teens too and every group has emotionally troubled kids
3286081 people have expectations and people are comfortable when the work is straightforward and it addresses one topic
3286082 but once there are all of these different things going on people are forced to intermingle they are all trying to figure out the same problem i enjoy watching that
3286083 i wanted to see rather than putting characters in the setting to tell the story if i could tell the story with just the setting
3286084 its about awareness of where i am what i need to do and whos paying attention
3286085 its a really bizarre combination of things and thats the whole point to throw people off as to what it is supposed to represent and give people options on how they choose to relate to them
3286086 i sort of make my work as a way of socializing its my way of communicating with people
3286087 thats how i touch base with everyone to make sure that what i am doing is appropriate and what i am thinking is right
3286088 ive been doing this as long as i can remember
3286089 my ideas expand so theres changing but i honestly feel like ive been in the same gear since kindergarten or first grade
3286090 first grade was when i was big into it and organizing things
3286091 thats an unfortunate thing that happened but those were the times that ive learned a whole lot
3286092 i did a lot of growing up i figured out how i want to function how i could help people out and how people are going to help me out i realized that people are really willing to support me
3286093 no one has ever discouraged me from doing art as a matter of fact i dont even allow it

3286103 how can we hold our great fag um ah ah flag high in the air under the pretences of fa reedom and democracy when we cant even grant those god given rights with respect to our own people i know a few of my party members have made some poor and tasteless comments regarding two very courageous and daring individuals nathan knorrs and falou bitter the founders of monq and for that on behalf of my party i apologize
3286104 id like to make this a day of celebration a symbol for all the people of this great nation declaring the common ground on which we stand and fight and struggle and further our time honored fa reedoms and democracy
3286105 hey falou move your fat german ass i cant see the tv

3286121 i was just thinking to myself this is the last lift girl you do this
3286122 i get really nervous before a competition but i tell you watching her i could barely sit still
3286123 it was a different feeling being in the stands but she did incredible and were all so proud of her its the best competition shes had since i cant even remember when
3286124 im disappointed with how i did the last lift was an american record lift thats probably the biggest disappointment because ive done it in the gym
3286125 its kinda like the difference between china and the u s in basketball
3286126 i need howard to set me up and i can smash all day
3286127 gold would be nice but just to get a medal would be a huge achievement for us
3286128 i started wearing it at the u s open and when i won i decided to keep wearing it
3286129 we want to show the american public that this is a competitive sport
3286130 i think the sport could explode in the u s if we get a medal
3286131 right now its getting popular in california but if we win a medal that could change

3286133 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3286134 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3286135 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3286136 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3286137 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3286138 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3286139 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3286140 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3286141 if a contributor lies to campaigns thats outside the control of the campaign

3286144 i thought i would see this only on tv never in real life
3286145 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
3286146 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all

3286151 it is an exciting new addition to our knowledge of the relationship between dylan thomas and his wife
3286152 it is very raw and emotional sometimes she says oh my god i wish id never married him and at other times she wishes she was in the grave with him giving him a cuddle

3286157 we attack the opportunism of the partisan and political interests of the governing left who allied themselves with the right to give rise to the law that validated yesterdays recall vote and with the referendum they sought to destroy departmental autonomy
3286158 to impose his illegal and racist constitutional project because he will then have entered a blind alley with no way out
3286159 the referendum changed very little of the situation this means the two sides will keep on pressing their agendas
3286160 the results do not strengthen the perspective of imposing a new constitution
3286161 although you feel tired and youre in an awful lot of dirt you just cant beat it
3286162 in the county fair season this year weve had some record attendance

3286166 its something the district has been anxiously awaiting to begin
3286167 this is the moment weve been waiting for we wanted to be sure to take our time and get things ready properly and judiciously to make sure well have quality workmanship and a quality product in the end
3286168 theres a lot of pride and excitement in the community
3286169 ive been to a couple class reunions where some of those kids have siblings in the schools and you can just sense how proud they are that the time has come to upgrade our school facilities and how it will benefit the students a big factor is that weve been able to keep our academic programs right at the top of everything well be rated excellent on the next state report card which will be the sixth time in the past six years thats certainly helped keep the excitement for this project going
3286170 we all have various emotions and various thoughts and feelings about the program
3286171 compatible solution to the needs of the various organizations that are here
3286172 prime land in the middle of the city very attractive and green
3286173 commissioners will always consider the kinney building and the land around the kinney building as sacred land
3286174 its greenspace being enjoyed by the entire county its a jewel in the middle of the city
3286175 i as a commissioner would not want them fields inside the walking track
3286176 i think that we need to leave it for enjoyment of all not just soccer parents
3286177 the fields will actually go parallel to the walking track which reduces the velocity of any ball going into the track
3286178 the walking path gets a lot of use as well
3286179 make sure you know what you need and you can project what you might need five years into the future

3286182 every nine years and 38 days i feel like sharing
3286183 and not just one game but wins the league away from them
3286184 our kids are continuing to work hard and hopefully we can take the next step this year
3286185 were just trying to figure out where were at right now
3286186 lexington looks really strong and has an excellent junior class and i think ashland will reload
3286187 i think it should be a real competitive league again
3286188 is as good as anyone weve had at his position
3286189 we feel like we have some real nice skilled players and our line isnt as big as in past years
3286190 i think everybody knows what shawn riley 1 302 yards rushing last year can do and dmetre house will play receiver and some running back
3286191 nick allen has worked real hard and were excited to have him back at quarterback we have some good experience back on the lines too i think its going to be a real even league whoever gets the momentum early could be the team to beat
3286192 we have some good returnees but were real young up front
3286193 we have about six guys in the lineup who really havent played much varsity football
3286194 we did pretty good in our scrimmage with waynedale and tuslaw and the kids hit real well which was a concern i just want us to keep working and getting better
3286195 i learn a lot when i play with grant and i enjoy playing with him maybe he gave the rest of us a chance by not being there
3286196 i never really had a big number today i kept it in the fairway pretty good
3286197 my short game was good too and that helped its nice to start off the season with a solid round
3286198 dannys cool and he makes good decisions on the golf course
3286199 he doesnt follow one mistake with another one hes resilient out there and i hope we have a solid season with him leading the way
3286200 with max ive had him for four years and hes a great kid and a great leader
3286201 he knows this is his team and the rest of the guys know it
3286202 brices round could have been even better he had a couple of double bogeys
3286203 brice and justin both know they have to shoot five or six over for us to compete at least until our younger kids improve as we go along
3286204 we only get five days before the season starts to get ready and not all of the kids play every day but hopefully the more matches we play the better well get
3286205 but if brice and justin stay consistent i think well compete
3286206 to do that in your first high school match i couldnt be more pleased
3286207 it was just a very solid round he was just very calm and played solid today
3286208 this was the first match for two of our top four scorers and another one was playing this course for just the second time
3286209 so while we know we can do better were so young and inexperienced that i am pleased with this start to finish as solidly as we did were pleased with that
3286210 i know where your g spot is and i know how to crush guts

3286219 you just take it out of the cage display and put the chicken back inside
3286220 if you keep it close to your body it wont flap its wings at all
3286221 it feels safe ive always said i can take a bird on a roller coaster if ive got a good hold on it
3286222 o mighty king lover of justice you have established equity you have executed justice and righteousness in jacob
3286223 o lord our god you answered them indeed you were a god who forgave them yet punished them for their evil deeds
3286224 although you are barren having borne no children you shall conceive and bear a son now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink or to eat anything unclean for you shall conceive and bear a son no razor is to come on his head for the boy shall be a nazirite to god from birth it is he who shall begin to deliver israel from the hand of the philistines
3286225 a man of god came to me and his appearance was like that of an angel of god most awe inspiring i did not ask him where he came from and he did not tell me his name but he said to me you shall conceive and bear a son
3286226 o lord i pray let the man of god whom you sent come to us again and teach us what we are to do concerning the boy who will be born
3286227 the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me
3286228 now when your words come true what is to be the boys rule of life what is he to do
3286229 let the woman give heed to all that i said to her she may not eat of anything that comes from the vine she is not to drink wine or strong drink or eat any unclean thing she is to observe everything that i commanded her
3286230 allow us to detain you and prepare a kid for you
3286231 we gave you strict orders not to teach in this name yet here you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this mans blood on us
3286232 we must obey god rather than any human authority the god of our ancestors raised up jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree god exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior that he might give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are witnesses to these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
3286233 fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men for some time ago theudas rose up claiming to be somebody and a number of men about four hundred joined him but he was killed and all who followed him were dispersed and disappeared after him judas the galilean rose up at the time of the census and got people to follow him he also perished and all who followed him were scattered so in the present case i tell you keep away from these men and let them alone because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin it will fail but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow them in that case you may even be found fighting against god

3286423 league tables increase pressure on teachers to move away from authentic learning and towards merely preparation of students to pass tests
3286424 pates appears near the top so you might think i like league tables
3286425 however nothing could be further from the truth league tables impoverish education

3286436 i probably should clarify things right now as far as the starting running back position is concerned
3286437 were going to use a number of running backs and the starter as far as im concerned will be the guy that plays the first play in the game not because one has earned the privilege to start over another itll be based on what we decide to do as an offensive staff to start the game
3286438 theyre going to play and obviously were going to have two players and as it looks right now its going to be lendale and its going to be chris johnson and were going to interchange them throughout the game and back them up with the other guys
3286439 it doesnt look severe it looks like were pretty fortunate well list him as day to day
3286440 my original plan was to graduate from bahs and go to my dream school tufts
3286441 i had never thought of the possibility of not going to college
3286442 i had always looked forward to being in an intellectual environment where people are interested in what theyre studying
3286443 there people dont apply to go college and go through the anxiety if they have good grades they are automatically in
3286444 keep your mind open to other possibilities of what your life can be take advantage of what you have in front of you and although you may run into difficulties you can get beyond them
3286445 i had surrendered to the idea of not going to college this fall now the idea of having roommates orientation classes is great

3286453 le times ne voulait pas r gurgiter les articles de lenquirer sans les v rifier ce qui est une attitude responsable mais le times na pas essay de les v rifier au del de quelques tentatives ce en quoi il avait tort je pense
3286454 il existe une tendance quelle soit juste ou non ne pas prendre au s rieux ce quon lit dans le national enquirer

3286475 world records arent just being broken by single seconds they are going by four seconds
3286476 as soon as i dived in they filled up with water and i stopped and put them back up and then i couldnt see anything to spot my turns
3286477 so i think that is what did it this hat isnt mine so there was a bit of panic last night for hats they have ordered new ones in but they couldnt get them here for this race i think they are here tomorrow
3286478 the irish logo was fine but we had two speedo logos on the hat and you are supposed to have one we have used these hats at meets before and there has been no problem but the olympic rules are a bit different
3286479 i wasnt nervous or anything i still felt pretty strong in the water this is hard but these things happen i probably went out and came back at the same speed so i had the fitness for it if i get this hat situation sorted i will be all right i am aiming for an irish record i havent really been training front crawl
3286480 its amazing i felt really good and strong in the water that was just a warm up i wasnt nervous going out at all it is so well run
3286481 so for it to happen at the olympics is a bit of a bummer i was considering just pulling my goggles off and i probably should have i can train without goggles but then there is a lot of chlorine in that pool for obvious reasons so i dont know everything has gone well except for that race i have been training well the perception was we were prospects for 2012 but i still felt that i had earned it and not just been given a place i dont want to repeat myself but i couldnt see where i was going and that is always a bit of a negative when you are trying to swim
3286482 it is a fast olympics world records arent just being broken by single seconds they are going by four seconds it has been an eye opener already

3286511 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3286512 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3286513 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank if you do it you are on your own
3286514 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3286515 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3286516 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3286517 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about

3286561 wat is er mooier om te zeggen zo hier is het het is klaar ik ga zeilen
3286562 als je de hoogte vergeet zijn het de afmetingen van een graf
3286563 ja de afmetingen van dit kamertje dwingen mij om me te concentreren een werkruimte moet afsluiten weinig licht is ook prettig hoewel de eerlijkheid gebiedt te zeggen dat mijn tweede werkkamer in huis goede verlichting heeft maar in deze ruimte heb ik een klein lampje dat op mijn handen schijnt en ik brand wat kaarsjes voor de sfeer dat brengt me in de juiste gemoedstoestand
3286564 ik heb aan de wanden geluidsisolerend materiaal bevestigd want omgevingsgeluid haalt me direct uit mijn concentratie en zelfs daaraan heb ik niet genoeg ik heb ook nog altijd een koptelefoon op mijn hoofd als ik aan het schrijven ben
3286565 absoluut als de telefoon gaat dan ben ik verloren ik heb namelijk altijd wel een uur nodig om in de juiste stemming te komen en als ik daarin word gestoord kan ik weer van voren af aan beginnen
3286566 vroeger vond ik dat je je eigenlijk eerst moest scheren en een schoon overhemd aan moest trekken voordat je begon met schrijven
3286567 de eerste uren moet ik inkomen ik noem dat indalen dan lees ik keer en keer over wat ik de vorige dag heb gemaakt
3286568 maar ik kan ook hele lange dagen en nachten maken waarin ik makkelijk negen of tien uur doorschrijf normaal dwing ik vijfhonderd goeie woorden af in een sessie van vier of vijf uur maar als ik het gevoel heb dat ik de goede vorm gevonden heb en het ga winnen van de chaos dan haal ik per dag gemakkelijk vijftienhonderd of tweeduizend woorden
3286569 ja dat raakt aan iets heel wezenlijks in mij ik wil de werkelijkheid fixeren het niet voorbij laten gaan in mijn oude verhalen staat dat ik lijd aan de vasthoudziekte want ik doe het al heel lang vishaakjes waarmee ik een karper heb gevangen hang ik aan de muur met de twee loodjes er nog bij om me die mooie vismiddag te blijven herinneren of ik neem van vakantie stenen en schelpen mee zo bouwt zich dus een verzameling van tastbare herinneringen op maar het is een speelse verzamelwoede niet pathologisch ik kan alles best weggooien na een tijdje in mijn oude werkkamer dat is nu de kamer van mijn zoon heb ik alle knipsels weggehaald daar hingen de muren helemaal vol mee
3286570 met een boekje over mijn uitgevers ik heb er een hoop versleten de afgelopen veertig jaar ik put onder andere uit mijn briefwisseling met geert van oorschot iemand die altijd in mij heeft geloofd toen ik nog alleen korte verhalen schreef en mijn lezerspubliek niet zo groot was dat wordt dus essayistiek ik heb met nestor de verering van quirina t en eindelijk volstrekt alleen een trilogie afgerond
3286571 laat ik beginnen te zeggen dat die boeken nooit als trilogie zijn bedoeld maar dat ze organisch zo gegroeid zijn ik heb de themas die voor mij belangrijk zijn in deze boeken vormgegeven mijn verhouding tot vrouwen de strijd met de drank mijn maatschappelijke positie dus het onderwijs en niet in de laatste plaats mijn jeugd en de verhouding tot mijn vader het familiedrama uit mijn jeugd is me altijd blijven achtervolgen mijn vaders hele familie behalve hijzelf pleegde op de eerste dag van de oorlog gemeenschappelijk zelfmoord dat heeft een enorme impact gehad op mijn jeugd want mijn vader heeft daar nooit over kunnen praten terwijl ik dat van hem eiste maar ik kon van hem eisen wat ik wilde hij had zijn eigen leven en maakte zijn eigen keuzes maar ik wil mijn leven in woorden fixeren zoals ik ook die vishaakjes ophang het is voor mij van belang dat het verleden mijn leven mij niet door de vingers glipt daar heb ik een term voor niet anoniem passeren
3286572 kort en goed komt het hierop neer ik schreef de novelle nestor waarin een jongetje indruk wil maken op het mooiste meisje van de school met een uil die hij probeert af te richten daarbij kwam er zoveel van mijzelf naar boven dat ik dacht dit moet meer worden toen drong zich een nieuwe laag op victor van gigch mijn literaire alter ego leraar en schrijver vertelt nu dat verhaal in een derde laag beschrijft l h wiener victor van gigch na nestor ben ik aan een nieuw boek begonnen de verering van quirina t waarin ik als hoofdthema de verhouding tot mijn vader neem een man die vermorzeld uit de oorlog is gekomen daarin kwam ook mijn jeugd aan bod en het ontluikende gevoel voor vrouwen een obsessionele fantasiewereld rondom een beauty van toen de moeder van een schoolvriendje victor is in quirina 57 en gaat op audi ntie bij die dame die inmiddels 83 is dat is de rode draad in quirina in eindelijk volstrekt alleen keert victor van gigch zich van wiener af waarmee er weer een laag minder is en de schrijver wiener op zichzelf is aangewezen dankzij quirina het jonge meisje waarmee wiener een verhouding heeft is in eindelijk volstrekt alleen zijn omgang met alle vrouwen uit zijn leven tot een cirkelgang gekomen
3286573 mijn hele oeuvre heb ik altijd op een organische manier laten ontstaan al die lijnen in de trilogie zijn op een natuurlijke manier samengekomen ik zit in mijn eigen leven als een spin in een web ik verzin weinig maar ik kan wel vormgeven
3286574 dit is een mooi moment om te kijken of ik mijn fantasie kan aanspreken om boeken te schrijven ik heb het nooit met het mes op de keel geprobeerd want mijn eigen leven gaf genoeg stof maar als dat niet lukt dan maal ik er geen moment om wat geeft het als het op is hoezo nieuwe boeken nescio heeft vier boeken geschreven en toch een prachtig oeuvre neergezet in eindelijk volstrekt alleen wijd ik er een passage aan wat is er mooier dan te zeggen zo hier is het het is klaar ik ga zeilen

3286633 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3286634 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3286635 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3286636 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3286637 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience
3286638 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3286639 this is a big competition and its being held in china so there was a lot of pressure to perform at our best
3286640 it felt like the only people that believed in us was us
3286641 we will learn from the chinese and we will be up for the next challenge

3286663 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country there is no possible justification for these attacks
3286664 the united states europe and all other concerned countries to stand united in condemning this aggression

3286667 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3286668 the roots of this tragedy lie in the decision of georgias separatist leaders in 1991 to abolish south ossetian autonomy this turned out to be a time bomb for georgias territorial integrity

3286672 t he nazi bell was said to be extremely dangerous causing illness mutation and death in animal and possibly human subjects one of nick cooks scientist contacts in the hunt for zero point even went so far as to claim that the bell was a torsion field generator and that the ss scientists were attempting to build some sort of time machine with it
3286673 represented something at the very pinnacle of ss general hans kammlers occult and super secret ss wonder weapons empire
3286674 the following are the salient features of the bell according to information cook received from both german and czech sources
3286675 one of the most fascinating sections in your book is in chapter 3 entitled nazi wonder weapons on page 87 you write time traveling nazis this horrendous idea sounds preposterous but the science is there and the bell did exist explain what the bell was to hitlers nazis and why it is linked to time travel well the bell and even today there are attempts to duplicate the experiments they were conducting on the bell it was simply called the bell because it was kind of a bell shaped object this object had an outer chamber and inner chamber and created electromagnetic energy fields that were set into rotation movement then one layer would rotate clockwise the other layer would rotate counter clockwise in doing this it increased the power and the efficiency of this energy field generator in doing so there were some very unusual properties around the bell plants either blossomed and grew or withered and died people would die around this thing this plays into some of the stories that weve heard from other sectors such as the infamous philadelphia experiment experiments with energy and magnetic fields that apparently altered the whole composition of material objects including people editors note wikipedia operation ghost was an alleged naval military experiment at the philadelphia naval shipyard in philadelphia pennsylvania on or about october 28 1943 the u s destroyer escort uss eldridge was to be rendered invisible to human observers for a brief period in what was called project rainbow allegedly conducting the experiment was franklin reno or rinehart ph d as a military application of the unified field theory theorized by physicist albert einstein the unified field theory describes the interrelated nature of the weak and strong forces and electromagnetic and gravitational forces to date no single theory has emerged with a viable mathematical expression it is said that reno et al thought it might be possible to use some version of this theory to bend light around an object so that it became essentially invisible this would have required specialized equipment and sufficient energy the navy saw the military value and sponsored the experiment the uss eldridge would have been fitted with the required equipment at the naval yards in philadelphia according to some accounts one test on july 22 1943 resulted in the eldridge being rendered almost completely invisible with some witnesses reporting a greenish fog in its place crew members allegedly complained of severe nausea afterwards by october 28 1943 it is said in another test the eldridge teleported and appeared 215 miles south of philadelphia offshore the norfolk virginia naval base then disappeared before eyewitnesses in norfolk and reappeared at the philadelphia naval ship yards it has been reported that one of the men on the ship was found embedded in a brick wall in italy and some others in the crew went mad no hard evidence in government records of such a ship teleportation have ever publicly surfaced today in 2008 given the fact that you and i and others have been exposed to a lot of information about what lt col philip j corso of our own u s army described as extraterrestrial biological entities do you think there is any hard evidence that germany had non human intelligence help either building these bell craft or that they are literally non human craft that were placed underground in the peenemunde region of germany and led to the advanced technologies of the hitler reich thats a really fascinating question linda and i try to address that in my book the rise of the fourth reich for years i had heard stories that the nazis had captured a flying disc or a flying saucer and had back engineered it die glocke the bell is the name of a purported secret nazi hunt for zero point but every time you try to track those stories they just seem to peter out theres no real hard evidence that anything like that ever happened and now what i and several other researchers are coming to the conclusion is that beginning in the early 1920s just like in america in germany there was a resurgence of interest in spiritualism and in the occult and we can trace hitler and some of his handlers directly into some of these occult societies such as the vril or thule society what seems to have happened in an early day version of remote viewing or perhaps what we would call channeling they did come in contact with non human intelligences which this contact then provided them with clues if not direct knowledge of technology that was far beyond what the allies were able to come up with this is one of the key explanations for how the nazis were able to continue on after wwii do you have anything that supports strongly that the bell was truly extraterrestrial technology made by tall blond haired blue eyed humanoids and that was why hitler had an obsession about a super race of tall blond blue eyed people i think that falls under conjecture but informed conjecture there is no question that hitler who was kind of short and dark haired he certainly did not match the description of the aryan superman nevertheless he and his ss were obviously just fixated on the idea of the tall blond blue eyed nordic german aryan now where did that come from so i think the assumption that it came from their channeling or remote viewing experiences with the nordic e t s as has been described by numerous experiencers i think that might be valid but we really dont have any hard proof of that the bell that nazi germany apparently had at peenemunde might be truly an example of an extra terrestrial biological entity technology e t technology thats true and the difference here is that in discussing the tall nordic blond e t s all we have are narratives there does not seem to be any hard evidence of their existence and yet when it comes to the nazi bell we have living witnesses who were involved in that project who have described it we have the physical remains of some of the testing facilities the ruins are still there in germany they are very real they do exist so there is a lot of physical evidence support for the nazi bell technology than there is for the tall blond aryan e t s why was the bell linked to time travel because when you get these counter rotating vortices of energy fields apparently it can negate gravity of course anti gravity is something that weve been searching for over a very long time apparently what happens is that if you negate gravity you concurrently are negating time this gets back into the missing time element within so many of the ufo sighting reports people say well i saw this ufo at 6 pm and i didnt get home until 7 pm and yet its only a ten minute drive what happened to the missing time its well known in the literature that when the ufo comes over the car stops right and yet when the ufo moves away the car starts again but no one ever talks about turning on the starter or turning the key no the car stops and then it starts thats because in the energy fields around the car time stops as well as gravity is neutralized and thats what holds the ufo up in the air the pistons which were pounding away in the car engine freeze they just stop because time has stopped then when the energy field moves off the pistons go back to banging again and the car motor is running again so this is the correlation between gravity and time if you have this e t technology that can negate gravity then you can also negate time which indicates you might be able to move within time and that raises the distinct possibility of time travel were talking about the bell project which definitely existed and were talking about some of the theoretical effects of the bell but the main problem is that not much is known about the bell its all been kept top secret and i personally believe that the secrets of the bell are still in certain files accessible by certain globalist factions today notice i did not say the u s government because the u s government implies your local irs agent and your postmen and your local representatives and they dont have a clue no this power of technology is being kept very close to the chest by the people who see it as a means to power and control where did all the alleged bell shaped or disc shaped craft go after world war ii good question i dont know anyone who knows what is your greatest fear going forward from july 2008 i dont think there is any easy remedy for washington d c its so out of control so over bloated so convoluted so corrupt that theres not going to be any way short of just a massive march on washington to tell everybody there to go and get a real job and that aint going to happen so what do you think is the fate of the united states well i do think were kind of at a crossroads and i think its going to be a foot race to see whether enough people wake up and we begin to take charge of our own lives and our own communities and our own neighborhoods hermann goering at nuremberg said getting the people to go along with the leaders is no big deal its no secret you just tell them theyve been attacked and then you describe anyone who protests as unpatriotic and we see that happening today in the united states

3286803 e la risposta nel dire che comunque la forma c e che stamattina abbiamo veramente soltanto sbagliato gara la forma c come sempre sappiamo reagire dopo una delusione quindi limportante quello
3286804 c amarezza per non aver centrato la finale a squadre
3286805 e difficile vincere una volta ma avere il peso e la rsponsabilit di doversi confermare era tutto cos vicino ma tutto cos lontano
3286806 c amarezza per non aver centrato la finale a squadre
3286807 non pensavo di tirare con jeannet con questa facilit avevo capito che la gara delle olimpiadi era una gara differente dalla altre semplicemente per lapproccio mentale e quindi ho cercato di lavorare su quello e andata bene
3286808 c amarezza per non aver centrato la finale a squadre
3286809 io ho cercato di stare con le altre nel primo 200 per cercare una progressione nel secondo 200 e non fare come ieri che magari son passata troppo veloce e poi per sinceramente sembra una scusa banale per per noi gareggiare al mattino assolutamente non impossibile perch ci siamo allenati tutto lanno magari facendo lavori forte al mattino per comunque gare al mattino non ne abbiamo mai fatte quindi forse la colpa non proprio solo nostra dovevamo fare le gare soprattutto in casa nostra di mattina gli assoluti gareggiare di mattina solo cos magari ci si pu abituare e vero che abbiamo fatto tutto lanno gli allenamenti forti al mattino per diverso gareggiare non sono solo io che parlo sono i risultati di tutti gli altri atleti che hanno gareggiato fino adesso che al pomeriggio sono andati fortissimo e alla mattina hanno peggiorato
3286810 c amarezza per non aver centrato la finale a squadre

3286820 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3286821 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3286822 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3286823 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3286824 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3286862 i dont think people who harass women on the street are necessarily single or necessarily sexually frustrated there are many millions of people who are extremely frustrated but they do not harass women
3286863 i think the issue is one of violence and gender disparities pure and simple
3286864 they ask young girls here when they are three or four who would you marry they implant the idea your only purpose in life is to get married

3286868 i have all these people poor people and they are waiting for treatment some of them will die for lack of an operation that is the reality
3286869 what would be the point of doing that for five or 10 years if after that you could not look people in the eye
3286870 i am watching a lot of people dying and it hurts me these are innocent people and the government is there with its big villas and cars i cannot accept that
3286871 the president has made it clear that health is a priority
3286872 if we had people who were really patriotic it would be different

3286893 that was the most amazing swim ive ever seen it got a lot of us really pumped up
3286894 ive never been the guy to put on a certain image just because i run the 100 meter dash
3286895 basically im the same person on and off the track i just get a little more intense when the gun is shot
3286896 i said mom kobe bryant asked about my leg she was shocked as well it was amazing

3286906 goodbye dad i never want to see you again or speak to you again
3286907 and were on this side whats the difference between this side and that side
3286908 i understand theyre trying to make a buck but they werent supposed to be allowed in like this
3286909 is it wise to have a propane facility of this kind immediately adjacent to residential properties obviously in light of what happened the answer is no
3286910 i think the municipalitys got some responsibility here and definitely the owners of the company im seeing the lawyer at 3 oclock and well see whats going to happen
3286911 im concerned about the foundation the base the condition of the house these are old houses most of them
3286912 the australian coach is taking tapes of us making tackles they took those to the technical delegate tried to stir it up about our play to see if the refs get involved
3286913 i found that a shame and i wanted to let them know that were a proud country and were proud of where we are and we deserve to be here
3286914 i think they respected our play why else would you bother wasting time with little old canada no 15 in the world we took that as a bit of a confidence boost for us we kept quiet and after the game i let them know
3286915 they were in the papers saying that when they play canada its going to be half hockey half rugby
3286916 well you know we just play tough hockey we play within the rules
3286917 not only us there were a whole bunch of other countries that they thought were a bit physical and stuff but thats gamesmanship it happens in all sports
3286918 it is one if we are to progress up the ladder and world rankings we must get it
3286919 weve played them a couple of times theyve been close games we beat them once we tied them once and they beat us once
3286920 there are winnable games we played great britain and we did okay with them south africa i think is ranked close to us but theyre probably thinking the same
3286921 we came in with a best time of 3 16 i think to go from that to 3 08 and beat the americans pretty much is near impossible
3286922 weve been on the right track and were still on the right track and were just going to keep building on it
3286923 the team itself feels really good together strong as a group they feel they belong here
3286924 a lot of good things have happened and theyre feeling it feeling theyre getting a lot closer to all the competitors theyve been reading about
3286925 youre seeing a bunch of young kids excited about swimming theyre here now with the suit which we didnt have at the national trials
3286926 ive been saying for a couple of years that the team has the possibility to win medals and id be disappointed if we didnt but it wouldnt be a deal breaker
3286927 m any documents were included in the exhibits that referred to a variety of names for sunrise
3286928 the judgment itself im sure speaks volumes of the ethics for sunrise
3286929 weve done nothing wrong my husband had his company for 13 years providing hundreds of jobs please leave us alone
3286930 again i have no further information to provide im sorry
3286931 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
3286932 i dont want to say i cruised it the 23 year old commented of his or heat and lets try to keep these things straight
3286933 i think michael knows we didnt do this for him lezak pointedly observed later
3286934 he was a part of it whether he wins eight or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3286935 i am making preparations to travel back to my home
3286936 master cpl doyle was killed while he was protecting his position and his fellow soldiers
3286937 the combat outpost was engaged in a classic sort of scoot and shoot fashion and unfortunately master cpl doyle was killed by a direct hit on the outpost
3286938 erin was a big tough mountain of a man who enjoyed the outdoors
3286939 he was a true warrior and just the person you would want beside you in a firefight
3286940 hed been in contact before with the enemy so he knows what to expect
3286941 he knows how to get through it and that sort of experience is very valuable for young ncos
3286942 remembered with the utmost gratitude and respect of this nation
3286943 he was an exceptional canadian and courageous soldier who died while bravely serving his country
3286944 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3286945 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3286946 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3286947 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3286948 no one was out of their houses no one was sitting on their front lawns the numbers of casualties we could have had would be tremendous
3286949 the problem with asbestos is when its disturbed and becomes airborne it becomes dangerous to people
3286950 we are unable to allow people in the vicinity until the ministry of the environment approves our plan for cleanup
3286951 the city does not give permission for a facility of this kind
3286952 the city keeps saying they have no record of any written complaints about the corporation and that probably is true but only because they told us the residents its a done deal
3286953 the kind of place someone would go fill up their barbecue
3286954 a little scary but no big deal then overnight it was this massive operation
3286955 every time maria augimeri would turn around and say zoning
3286956 for the city to suggest they didnt know the community was upset it isnt true
3286957 this was the first time ive closed my store in seven years
3286958 i dont even close it during snowstorms i cant afford to
3286959 again and again they asked how is it possible that a propane facility like this was their next door neighbour as citizens as government representatives their questions are our questions
3286960 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3286961 oh we really wanted to add a couple of women to the list but didnt
3286962 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3286963 with the u s economy possibly worsening is it really a good idea to use that much money to make it a full subsidiary
3286964 when i sent my first tape to the head of gramophone programmes at the bbc i had made the fatal mistake of forgetting to rewind it to the start
3286965 yet that gentleman took the time to wind it all the way back and once hed listened to it things went from there
3286966 i can tell you if i was a young chap coming over from ireland today they probably wouldnt even listen to my tape let alone rewind it
3286967 somehow that old fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared i suppose no one has the time for it anymore
3286968 when i started people who worked for the bbc knew they werent earning as much as people in commercial television but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest if not the finest broadcasting organisation in the whole world
3286969 im not sure they feel that any more or at least that it means as much as it used to
3286970 i was considering giving up before belgrade and now i have to say im very doubtful about ever wanting to do eurovision again
3286971 ive had so much fun but i think its time for someone else to take over
3286972 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3286973 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3286974 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3286975 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3286976 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3286977 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3286978 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3286979 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3286980 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3286981 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3286982 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3286983 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3286984 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3286985 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3286986 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3286987 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3286988 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3286989 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3286990 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3286991 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3287017 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3287018 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3287019 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3287020 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3287021 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3287022 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3287023 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience
3287024 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3287025 we want the learning families to increase the students chance of creating strong significant relationships with others in their school
3287026 there are no sidewalks that im aware of on brentwood
3287027 one of the things ive proposed often among ourselves is we do a sidewalk program very similar to the traffic calming program
3287028 if 75 percent of the residents sign a petition we can bond it out over 20 years and it would be them paying to improve their property values
3287029 if were going to look at sidewalk projects and sidewalk programs we need to do that in quite a few areas of the city and we may want to look at something next fiscal year something a little more comprehensive to set priorities throughout the city
3287030 i would think theres more people coming from vermilion parish up here than going down there
3287031 i just think its time for us to make those gateways look a whole lot better its just trying to give a little bit better presentation for lafayette
3287032 the idea of giving customers more time to pay their bills is a good first step
3287033 we may have identified as much as 10 million in dnr the department of natural resources for the home energy loan program
3287034 high oil and gas prices are a blessing and a curse
3287035 its a blessing for the state of louisiana because its getting so much more in severance taxes but its a curse for so many people because their utility bills are being driven up by the high price of natural gas senior citizens and those on fixed income are suffering
3287036 couldnt afford to pay their utility bills because of the storm
3287037 this is an opportunity for them to build and do new things i felt like it was an appropriate time to make this move
3287038 coach gave me my first opportunity to become a university administrator
3287039 he was one of my first mentors and taught me to be sensitive to students and their needs over his many years of service he has also mentored dozens of college administrators that are now serving on campuses across the state
3287040 many of the remarkable things he has done at the university have gone unnoticed but have had a lasting impact on many students faculty and staff
3287041 the mold was removed rooms have been tested and sprayed and tests have come out with good air quality
3287042 the main thing was that the teachers had not had an opportunity to prepare their rooms
3287043 they worked all friday saturday and sunday and they were ready to rock and roll today
3287044 imagine what this could do for students in a classroom
3287045 instead of looking at the solar system in a book they can walk around inside of it
3287046 it would serve to better integrate the university into the daily life of acadiana
3287047 right now the pipeline of upcoming trained professionals isnt enough to meet demands
3287048 we need to do what we can to attract more students and diversify the education of the ones we have
3287049 we start with the kind of professional we want to create
3287050 then we work backwards crafting a program to meet those needs
3287051 the re education of professionals is just as important as the training of new ones if not more so
3287052 it gives someone in the workforce real options to continue their education that they wouldnt have if they had to come to campus to learn
3287053 todays professionals need to be prepared for the changes in their job and the market in general five years from now
3287054 if you want to see the future of business look to what the university is researching today
3287055 the university can be a leader in articulating the communitys economic future
3287056 were still of course running that shuttle which we just started today
3287057 mel oliver come in cap youre crossing the bottom of a ship coming at you
3287058 we just took his tow the barge is right in front of us and were running it over
3287059 he had become one of my closest and dearest friends
3287060 he played with us on at least eight shows here over the past six plus years
3287061 he enjoyed our music our food and our culture and was always ready to join us i will miss him
3287062 il macrolane nasce come versione per il corpo dellacido ialuronico che da anni gi ampiamente utilizzato per il viso infatti pi denso di restylane e perlane ed prodotto dallazienda svedese che unica in america ha ottenuto lautorizzazione dalla severa fda
3287063 biosintetico non di origine animale ed ottimo per il ripristino di volumi persi e per il bodyshaping cio il rimodellamento del corpo
3287064 in questo caso meglio aspettare prima di gridare al miracolo nel mondo la sperimentazione sul corpo del macrolane ha solo cinque anni in italia luso stato autorizzato lo scorso settembre per il corpo pochi mesi dopo anche per il seno la casistica di cui disponiamo ancora troppo bassa per valutare se si tratta di un impianto sicuro lunico studio serio conosciuto e pubblicato dal giapponese inami handa sul journal of plastic surgery americano riguarda 1 100 casi tutti giapponesi perch questa tecnica piace moltissimo in un paese in cui le donne sono minute e hanno poco seno una misura in pi su di loro un cambiamento eclatante
3287065 anche perch non affatto vero che si esegue in cos poco tempo non sempre basta lanestesia locale spesso bisogna anche sedare la paziente e quindi necessaria la presenza di un anestesista spaventata da un ago decisamente ragguardevole che penetra sottocute
3287066 non solo per effettuare pi punture e distribuire bene vari cc di gel possono bastare 30 40 minuti il recupero per richiede vari giorni ma la vera controindicazione che da chirurgo e da donna mi sento di dover sottolineare che nel seno andrebbero utilizzate solo sostanze ben delimitate come le protesi che nel caso sia necessario possano essere tolte come corpo unico perch non bisogna dimenticare che il seno pu anche essere colpito da tumori

3287070 a style of computing where massively scalable it enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to external customers using internet technologies
3287071 as service provisions a critical aspect of cloud computing grow vendors must become or partner with service providers to deliver their technologies indirectly to users
3287072 user organizations will watch portfolios of owned technologies decline as service portfolios grow the key activity will be to determine which cloud services will be viable and when
3287073 she was the love of my life and her children and her family everyone who knew her
3287074 she was absolutely the love and the light and the glue of our family
3287075 when it happened i kind of had a bad feeling when i didnt hear from her
3287076 she would have called to let me know she was all right
3287077 loved her kids she loved god and she loved to teach
3287078 she just retired this year when she sold the marina to us she was just enjoying her retirement
3287079 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3287080 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3287081 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3287082 this should not be a very difficult decision to make
3287083 while ata cannot by law even suggest uniform pricing policies to our members we will bring this matter to their attention for their independent consideration
3287084 air transport association member airlines have always been committed to supporting our nations military
3287085 airlines routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
3287086 we can help them with additional expenses for travel but soldiers have to submit a receipt and it has to be looked at by our finance people
3287087 they dont do it for the money there are bills they cant pay
3287088 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3287089 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3287090 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3287091 theres evidence that the bus may have suffered tire tread separation
3287092 we really want to have someone here who can speak that language who can really relate to that community
3287093 i would like a handful but one would be a great start
3287094 brazilians are very warm people it is easy for us to get used to other backgrounds other cultures
3287095 the women see the telenovelas and the brazilian magazines and they want those styles they like to look good and theyre not afraid to spend money
3287096 with the shops and the restaurants it gives a little bounce
3287097 we want to participate and give something before we ask for anything
3287098 we want to change peoples ideas of what immigrants are like
3287099 if youre a victim of a crime your immigration status is not going to come into play
3287100 we are trying to overcome this lack of trust because it hurts the people
3287101 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3287102 know your own risks the research doesnt mean we should stop worrying about weight all together
3287103 the data from these studies really show that there are limits to relying on bmi as a simple diagnostic test and you cannot assume that all people who are obese are the same in terms of their health risks bmi is just one measure of obesity and clearly does not tell the whole story
3287104 i think the message to the public should be that if you have a high bmi that is like getting a positive on a screening measure next you should see your doctor and have more extensive assessment to find out what exact health risks you are experiencing and what behaviors you can change to improve your health
3287105 in the end your weight may not change much but you can improve your health outcomes by improving diet and activity levels
3287106 the diet myth why americas obsession with weight is hazardous to your health
3287107 the bmi measurement is nonsensical it has zero scientific basis
3287108 and that is exactly the type of indiscriminate warfare at which the russian army is so adept their job is not so much a matter of defeating an opposing army as it is inflicting maximum destruction on all who oppose them civilian and military
3287109 they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them
3287110 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us why did we help them in iraq
3287111 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3287112 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3287113 we are confident that we have taken the right steps to address these challenging market conditions

3287118 ive never been to the festival before but there are similarities to manchester and the commonwealth games it dominates the city and it is what everyone is talking about
3287119 i started to learn italian while i was swimming because my brain was turning to mush i went once a week to whitefield adult learning centre and by the time i went to perugia i was fluent i did a year there and it was a major turning point in my life
3287120 i came back to study at the royal academy of dramatic art which was a bit different to the btech i did at sheena simon college in manchester
3287121 at rada i was treated as an actor first and foremost not as a swimmer turned actor
3287122 i dont want people to come and watch me for novelty value im deadly serious about this career hopefully this will be a breakthrough for me
3287123 ive not performed in manchester yet but the ultimate would be for me to act at the royal exchange
3287124 russian jets have carried out strikes on military targets in the central georgian town of gori close to the breakaway region of south ossetia
3287125 georgian officials say 60 people were killed when bombs hit two blocks of flats in the town
3287126 the comments came after russian commanders announced they were sending more troops into south ossetia
3287127 after days of exchanging heavy fire with the russian backed separatists georgian forces launched a surprise attack on thursday night to regain control of the region which has had de facto independence since the end of a civil war in 1992
3287128 in response moscow sent armoured units across the border russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said about 1 500 people had been killed so far including 15 of his countrys soldiers
3287129 georgia said russia had also launched air strikes on targets inside its territory in what it described as
3287130 the uk the us and france are pinpointing what they say is russias aggression as the key factor in the slide towards war while moscow insists georgia is to blame
3287131 they took a convenient time to attack such a small country
3287132 lets see some facts and how it present on us media
3287133 most viewers thought it was live shots and our work achieved its effect
3287134 elevation of the state total authoritarianism and mass performance without a single individual person it was stunning on the visual level barren on the human level
3287135 this sense that the world was coming to pay obeisance of course it was all harmonious only chinese civilization was visible and nothing about world civilization
3287136 this kind of opening ceremony is possible only in china because nobody else has that many people
3287137 to achieve these kinds of effects is possible only in china which has a state system that can attain perfection at all costs
3287138 my mother simply doesnt want to live any more in this situation
3287139 she feels she has lost her second chance at life and her extradition doesnt permit her to imagine herself in the future
3287140 this is a story that i know well because i had to leave italy because of these events
3287141 also because i had friends who were extremely close to slipping into terrorism like you slip into drug use
3287142 the courts have never established the full truth about what happened even though many of the terrorists are free or have never spent a day in jail for the public this is intolerable
3287143 enable the two companies to benefit from the rapid development of a modern supply chain

3287146 this is the time to cement brand loyalty with the mass consumer market getting buy in to brands by displaying awareness of consumers needs and continued interaction during an economic downturn will make sure that a brand is top of mind during the downturn and actively embraced in an upturn
3287147 a cost effective and highly visible approach for example is through community events marketing whereby brands gain exposure at weddings sports events and other community ceremonies
3287148 it is customary for large numbers of people to attend these functions giving manufacturers the opportunity to reach these consumers through activities such as hosting branding and sampling although this may seem an unusual practice by western standards this type of one on one interaction is greatly appreciated because it provides additional hands on support and equipment at these large functions and adds status to the events entrenching the brand in the hearts and minds of the community for marketers the events ensure exclusive trial and awareness of the product to an economically active audience more importantly it follows a philosophy of izandla ziyagezana support those who support you
3287149 these figures indicate a mounting consumer market ready to experience new and existing brands but perhaps in a more non conventional manner

3287182 a game im not interested in can be 100 000 hours long and i dont care maybe if it was one hour and all the attention was put on that one hour the game might be something i could get interested in meanwhile if something is awesome but too short i dont feel value for my investment the goal is to find the sweet spot

3287231 we are deeply disappointed that epa has failed to heed the very clear signs that the food to fuel policy is causing severe harm to the economy
3287232 when food prices are rising and chicken companies are losing money because of high feed costs it is outrageous that the federal government continues to require and even to subsidize the diversion of corn from the food supply into the fuel supply

3287235 the biovator is an in vessel composter that uses in vessel technology to enhance an age old process of composting
3287236 it speeds up the microorganisms and produces a pathogen free safe compost out of your mortalities in a very short period of time
3287237 the big driver right now is the price of fuel for incineration which a lot of producers are still doing thats really driving those producers to take a look at other alternatives
3287238 we compost everything on the farm from the weanling pigs after birth to the 500 and 600 pound sows to any of the other gilts in the operation
3287239 we soon found that the cost of incineration along with the air emissions was not something we could afford with diesel fuel approaching 4 50 so we in october of 2007 decided to seek another remedy for our mortalities and thats when we teamed up with biovator and began using the rotary drum composting system to dispose of our mortalities
3287240 during that audit we found several items that we could improve on but the largest one was our mortality removal and the method that we got rid of our mortalities
3287241 the energy audit itself showed that we had a value of about 28 000 to 30 000 a year in savings on diesel fuel alone not to mention the benefits for the environment and the ability to utilize the end product
3287242 we had looked at a number of different ways of composting and this just seemed to me to be a better and easier system to work with
3287243 the composter itself runs approximately 35 000 to 45 000
3287244 the whole composter runs on one one horse power motor so the electricity bills are very very minimal it only runs approximately two hours per day on a one horse power motor so its a matter of pennies per day
3287245 over the years weve handled deadstock on the operation every way conceivable and were always looking for a better way
3287246 the bin composting was far more labour intensive for one
3287247 the single biggest reason was that the bin composting tended to go anaerobic and therefore there was significant odour when we would turn the bins the other thing was in the summer months we ended up in a situation where we had a lot of flies the vessel composting has eliminated those issues and in addition the possibility of animals dogs coyotes or whatever digging into our bin composter and packing stuff off into the fields or the neighbours place
3287248 the beauty of it is the ongoing cost of running a biovator only come in at about 120 per year
3287249 this has become a lower cost option but more importantly to us its just become a much more pleasant operation in dealing with the unpleasant side of livestock production
3287250 if youve ever been to a store and bought potting soil its very similar probably a little more wood chips in it
3287251 nitrogen has become very expensive commercial fertilizers have become so expensive over the last two to three years with the rising cost of fuel its been important to utilize all sources of nitrogen that we can on the farm to produce our small grains and our hay
3287252 while were talking about the compost the composition of it if you have weak land like here in north carolina in certain areas we have sandy land that doesnt do a very good job of holding moisture this compost really builds up the land and the quality of the soil to help it maintain a little more moisture to grow a better crop
3287253 in the future i would expect a large swing over to some form of composting whether it be in vessel or just your standard form just due to the energy crisis i dont see those energy costs coming down any time soon and farmers are going to be watching their dollars a lot closer
3287254 i fantasize about having sex with two guys or having sex in public and lately about my pool contractor

3287268 god saw all that he created and behold it was very good

3287270 look at three things and you wont come to sin where you are going to the grave ethics of the fathers 3 1 ethics of the fathers does not say where you will be going in the future but where you are already going from the time we are born we begin a journey whose destination is our eventual death and entry into the afterlife thats why we must make the most out of every single day of our lives as the talmud states rabbi eliezer said repent one day before your death his students asked him does a person know when his day of death will occur he answered them then he should repent today perhaps he will die tomorrow thus all his days will be full of repentance this is what king solomon said in kohelet 9 8 your clothing should be white at all times there is an allegory which illustrates this a king invited his servants to a grand feast but did not inform them when the feast was to transpire the smart ones dressed in their finest clothes and prepared themselves by waiting outside the palaces entrance the foolish ones remained in their common clothes and continued to engage in their own pursuits thinking they had plenty of time suddenly the king asked for all to attend and only the smart ones were asked to sit eat drink and enjoy

3287292 tomorrow the city planning commission will hold public hearings on three controversial projects lower east side rezoning hunters point south and willets point redevelopment
3287293 each of these projects deserve a full and frank discussion and that means giving citizens in each community the time and attention they need to voice their opinions pro or con
3287294 the size and potential impact on affected communities and the city as a whole warrants an individualized public hearing and review process for each proposal
3287295 good government demands that we provide our citizens with every opportunity to be heard councilman hiram monserrate said
3287296 by rushing through a process peoples voices are denied the city planning commission must take its time and hold separate hearings for these major projects one is simply not enough
3287297 by grouping the hearings on these actions together the commission risks limiting the amount and quality of public participation for one or even all three items by forcing community members to wait for overly long periods of time before being heard this delay is likely to frustrate community members and may drive away speakers thereby limiting the breadth of expressed community opinions such a consequence is contrary to the spirit of a public hearing
3287298 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

3287317 its a talented squad and a great coaching staff and im very much looking forward to getting over to perth and making the most of my opportunities
3287318 the war is terrifying horrifying for civilians and we cant let it go on the french presidency of the european union council like all the countries of the eu is concerned and sometimes indignant at what is happening on its doorstep we must therefore try together with the americans and with the russians of course who are a participant in this conflict to stop the killing

3287406 there has been numerous initiatives launched to tackle community issues in rural areas but most of them have disappeared because they have tried to tell people what they need this is never going to work
3287407 nexus is all about giving communities the opportunity to bid for funding towards projects that will make a real difference to the quality of life in villages and towns in the zone
3287408 by strengthening the ties that bind individuals we can create a real can do attitude and this has been reflected in the notable achievements to date
3287409 the figures are encouraging but it is the detail of the projects and the benefits they provide that really shows what can be achieved through nexus
3287410 for example youve got the creation of a learning centre at oak farm to enable people with learning disabilities to develop farm tours a 4000 grant to help convert and refurbish martley village hall and we are providing funding towards vital members of staff at outreach groups
3287411 in short the scheme benefits everyone from the young to the old from individual groups to up and coming businesses
3287412 the rural regeneration zone has realised the important role the voluntary and community sector plays in providing vital services and facilities to local villages and this has been reinforced through nexus
3287413 without a doubt the funding has helped more projects come to fruition and what has been really pleasing is that the application process is straightforward so it appeals to everyone

3287501 at first i tried to just shove it in real hard and push the refrigerator door closed
3287502 it was too tall so i had to lower the shelf a notch
3287503 you put the bucket in your lap and eat right over it
3287504 that way you catch and save all the little fried bits and eat them when youre out of chicken
3287505 i could hear everything fall out when i shut the door i think because its slanted
3287506 the hardest thing to do is watch the one you love love somebody else
3287507 mr musharraf is going to fight these charges on a moral ground to try to disprove them but when it comes to the numbers i think hes lost it
3287508 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1bn a year the americans have been giving for the armed forces the army has been getting between the range of 250m to 300m 125m to 150m reimbursement for what they do but where is the rest of the money
3287509 absolutely president musharraf will prove all this wrong there is no way he will quit now quietly while being blamed for corruption
3287510 negotiations are going on for a safe exit to be given to him general kayani will be meeting mr musharraf later this evening
3287511 shahbaz sharif mr sharifs younger brother is acting as the interlocutor for the coalition i think the americans and the army are demanding he be given safe passage impeachment would mean a huge distraction from the war on terror
3287512 tengo que agradecer a mis amigos que hayan venido a tocar
3287513 yo soy un archivo viviente la m sica tiene una geograf a y una historia en el fondo la nuestra es la base de la occidental por eso puedo tocar con todos esos grandes m sicos y la kora es el pasaporte de la cultura mandinga
3287514 he o do a muchos pero ninguno es como l
3287515 siempre le ha dicho a toumani si quieres algo de m no tienes m s que pedirlo bj rk siempre repite que despu s de todo lo que l ha hecho por ella es lo m nimo
3287516 me gust mucho especialmente el mercado y la gente me gustaba pasear
3287517 eran las seis de la ma ana y recuerdo estar en su antigua casa en bamako con aquellos confortables sillones toumani se puso a tocar y yo intent unirme con mi mel dica pero soy un m sico tan limitado que sonaba disonante ahora al menos puedo tocar en armon a
3287518 no intento fusionar nada no se trata de imponerse es cuesti n de escuchar y aprender en occidente corremos el riesgo de que nuestra m sica pierda el alma por el dinero la m sica africana nos la devuelve
3287519 me hablaron de l durante a os y finalmente en una gira coincidimos en un hotel toumani estaba en el vest bulo saqu mi guitarra y tocamos juntos hasta que nos dijeron que par semos aquello se estaba llenando de gente
3287520 en la m sica hay gente que puede pasarse la vida estudiando son doctores pero toumani naci para ser toumani lo lleva en la sangre
3287521 ah donde le ves tenemos mucho en com n es un andaluz y un gitano

3287525 saya ingin memberi penjelasan karena kita akan hidup bersama kamu tidak perlu bertanya tanya lagi untuk selanjutnya
3287526 sejak saat ini bila pada suatu malam kamu melihat rambut saya sedang rapi maka artinya saya sedang tidak menginginkan seks bila rambut saya agak kurang rapi maka kemungkinan saya sedang tidak ingin seks namun bila rambut saya sangat berantakan maka itu berarti saya sedang menginginkan seks
3287527 saya juga ingin menjelaskan bahwa kalau saya pulang di malam hari biasanya saya habis minum di bar kalau saya minum 1 botol berarti saya tidak ingin seks kalau saya minum 2 botol berarti mungkin saya tidak ingin seks sedangkan bila saya minum 3 botol berarti saya tidak perduli dengan bentuk rambutmu
3287528 akhirnya uang lima juta impas gua kembaliin ke otang plus bonus ngeliat tamara bugil
3287529 iya mas dia orangnya baik sekali ya mas dia tadi ngasih hadiah ke aku uang sebanyak lima juta
3287530 and please make your position and speak with one united voice
3287531 i like your articles but the independent had a footnote the other day saying that stalin divided north and south ossetia its not true south ossetia has always been georgian
3287532 when blaze went down you just pray for him to be okay you know its tough but that s what happe ns its footb all and coach cal is doing a good job of getti ng the next guys ready
3287533 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed which he lived his life by
3287534 josh would be there for his friends at any time to lend a hand or to give them honest advice sometimes it was not the advice they wanted to hear but it was always the advice they needed
3287535 josh was a soldier he had always wanted to be a soldier and he loved what he did he felt strongly in what he was doing and the family is hopeful canadians will understand and appreciate the sacrifice josh has made for all canadians and the sacrifice of all families of military personnel serving in afghanistan
3287536 he was the kind guy that we would describe as the soldiers soldier
3287537 and i know thats a coined phrase but in fact he was one of those real guys always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades
3287538 hes a leade r by examp le and when he speak
3287539 its their job to approve a facility the city does not do that
3287540 some parts of toronto this would be permitted some it would not be
3287541 the safety of propane storage is especially significant to the city of toronto because resident and working population densities are so high that any level of hazard is one that could affect hundreds of persons in a single incident
3287542 it may be assumed that as redevelopment in the city continues and as the automotive propane distribution networks grow this fundamental conflict will intensify
3287543 the city wouldnt be in a position to know whether a facility has followed up with the province and achieved its licence
3287544 what happened in the riot is one hundredth of what should happen what will happen
3287545 this is just crazy talk from someone who is pissed off
3287546 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3287547 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3287548 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3287549 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3287550 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3287551 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3287552 on saturday the cops overreact and shoot three young guys who did nothing wrong on sunday they do nothing while this happens
3287553 i heard my brother say what are you doing to my brother and then i heard gunshots
3287554 my brother tried to help me and now hes dead
3287555 i feel very bad i feel very upset and we will get to the bottom of what happened
3287556 because of an idiotic move by one officer the bums and the gangs get inflamed and then the cops are powerless to do anything
3287557 una clara muestra de c mo est cambiando eeuu y una tendencia mucho m s importante que los propios ndices de audiencia
3287558 el harlem hispano est dominado por mexicanos el bronx tiene puertorrique os washington heights est lleno de dominicanos y en queens y brooklyn hay colombianos y mexicanos
3287559 we wouldnt believe her except she knows too much and her eyes she has your eyes
3287560 genetics man it was a trip kesh her lips even shaped just the same
3287561 well we have a few choices now but the question becomes what do we want to accomplish
3287562 i was shooting in hyderabad when some friends who saw the movie called me though i am the heroine in the film my name came after nayantaras in title card they didnt have to put me down so badly
3287563 when they quiz me about the treatment my role i have no answers for them its all right if i had been indifferent from the beginning but i was assured that my role would be satisfactory even before the project commenced i did not expect to be treated like this from a highly respected team
3287564 pasupathy and i had three children in the film two girls and a boy in this particular scene the boy who is dark skinned like his father asks me why he is dark it was a touching scene and came out very well everyone on the sets applauded it i was surprised that it was not used in the final version that made it to the theatres
3287565 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3287566 there were some paf civilians as well travelling in the vehicle we are trying to ascertain exactly how many were inside
3287567 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack or a roadside bomb
3287568 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge
3287569 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3287570 absolutely that will be the case after a five year period in term why wouldnt that be the case
3287571 weve got to be mature enough to handle that and deal with it
3287572 coming into the last year of contract with speculation and everything else that will go on over that six month period before the season
3287573 but thats no problem were all big boys we know thats where its exactly going to sit so i wont shy away from that at all
3287574 would i love to see brett deledio get to 25 years of age to see trent cotchin when hes got 100 games under his belt when our backmen have played together five or six seasons absolutely thats my desire to do that
3287575 ill be working as hard as i can to do my part of it and then decisions will be made
3287576 if we continue to improve with young players playing well were heading in the right direction
3287577 if we stagnate now that weve got young players playing or dont continue to improve well were not heading in the right direction
3287578 not where we want to be but a step in the right direction
3287579 as robots enter our everyday life they need to have sensors everywhere on their bodies like humans
3287580 imagine they bump into babies robots need to feel temperatures heat and pressure like we do to co exist otherwise it would be dangerous
3287581 it could be completely integrated into the normal driving system making users unaware of using it
3287582 objects that come into contact with humans are often not square or flat we believe interfaces between humans and electronics should be soft
3287583 we cant rule out the possibility of using this in living bodies but were sticking to using it in electronics
3287584 det mange oplever ved business intelligencen er hvad jeg kalder business forvirring de to ting l ner sig meget t t op ad hinanden
3287585 vi kan for eksempel sagtens sidde og kigge p et tal og sige hold da op hvor er vi blevet ringe vi har m ske tabt 60 procent af alle de tilbud vi har haft ude det tal er bare ikke relevant med mindre man f r koblet hele forretningsflowet p hvis tallet skyldes at vi i stedet har f et en stigende m ngde ordrer der g r lige igennem og udenom et tilbud s agerer man jo ud fra et forkert grundlag
3287586 det er en utrolig tung proces som man underkender at man skal igennem vi har pludselig s mange m letal og s meget information at vi kan blive forvirrede
3287587 my wife doesnt grow gm products and has no intention of growing gm products so people will make their own judgment about the veracity of that map and that document
3287588 i would hope that people would respect the right of farmers to make a choice
3287589 its fine for him to now say im being victimised or im being picked out but im afraid thats far from the truth
3287590 hes the one with millions of dollars to spend on promoting this technology and researching it and he needs to take responsibility for his actions because he is now exposing many other rural industries like the bee keepers and the grain harvesters to contamination
3287591 all weve done is collate whats in the public domain so no ones any more exposed than they were before
3287592 the operation is being carried out solely by forces of the abkhaz army
3287593 in the course of the next few days we will take full control of this district
3287594 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3287595 the georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3287596 the reason weve picked him is because were confident hell play
3287597 yesterday he did a bit of running on the treadmill and hes going to do some ballwork with us on wednesday and he goes back to the specialist on friday
3287598 he had a bit of a bounce in his step last week but he didnt get a clearance but this week were very confident he will
3287599 i did a couple of good sessions this morning so im reasonably confident ill be right to go
3287600 ive been hanging to get out there im a terrible spectator and i want to get out there as much as possible
3287601 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3287602 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3287603 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3287604 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3287605 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience
3287606 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3287607 this is an insult to the real singer and to all the people who listened
3287608 at every election theres been a massive swing against labor
3287609 i think that reflects the disillusionment that people have about labor governments across the country
3287610 we showed everybody the heart and soul of this team
3287611 we can store drop filter mutilate grope or modify data heading to you
3287612 we construct the man in the middle attack on the internet
3287613 internet routing is inherently trust based we told the route that we know the best way to an address a hacker could blast a lot of spam or launch a lot of phishing attacks
3287614 you can hijack stuff from china or the opposite it may already be happening who could tell
3287615 aggression against a small country in europe not be passed over in silence or with meaningless statements equating the victims with the victimizers
3287616 plant the seeds of love do not rip out the plants with hate
3287617 you talk about pruning the twigs as if they dont come from deep roots
3287618 the logic is so utterly flawed that i think a new fallacy was invented
3287619 my student loan is 865 a month for 30 years
3287620 i have a family to support and a mortgage to pay
3287621 people who cant afford to pay those payments are stuck
3287622 our staff has already been in touch with dr maris and were working to make sure he gets properly reimbursed
3287623 we need to get paid for our patients or we cant take care of them
3287624 it affects 20 to 30 percent of their cash flow
3287625 were thrilled to be in partnership with the santa cruz yacht club
3287626 im putting out an appeal to whoever has her to bring her back
3287627 it seemed like it was a pretty successful enforcement at least from our point of view
3287628 both judges showed good judgment in balancing out what i would call the more lenient cases to the more moderate and serious cases
3287629 theres a handful of people who didnt appear at all so there are bench warrants out for their arrest
3287630 whether or not people are going to avail themselves to that is another thing
3287631 considering the buildup that happened before this its all a big nothing
3287632 were still working out the details and grasping the complexity of owning this property
3287633 we are just in this morass with everybody else in the development business
3287634 were waiting for a clear signal that its the right time to move ahead
3287635 its not because brooks properties arent strong enough or santa cruz isnt a strong enough market but the lenders arent strong
3287636 i want to try and somehow get the communication back between parents and the board which has kind of taken away from parents
3287637 its about technical aspects of the building code not about appealing red tags
3287638 they dont want someone from the outside dictating how to run their process but thats whats made people upset people feel like they have no control
3287639 has the santa cruz county planning department been operating covertly behind the scenes has it criminally denied access to the building board of appeals
3287640 the planning departments idea of what they should be hearing is certainly different than the anti planning people
3287641 we need a thorough discussion of what the jurisdiction of this board is
3287642 why people do and call it home ill never understand
3287643 streets are wide everything is new you expect everything to be new you know
3287644 and the list goes on there were consequences co founders rick meikle the former ceo and don fitzpatrick the former chairman no longer work at towne some depositors have fled and borrowers even those with good credit are finding loans much harder to come by
3287645 they didnt want to do any more real estate loans
3287646 i fantasize about having sex with two guys or having sex in public and lately about my pool contractor
3287647 men would always tell me oh youre so beautiful you have such a great body you could be doing movies
3287648 with abc buying 18 to life its american television but you can still be here its a really nice door thats opening with flashpoint ctv cbs and the listener ctv nbc you can still be here and have success
3287649 i was supposed to go down to l a for the last three pilot seasons but i always come up with a viable excuse not to go
3287650 i also got a car because i had to be able to get there and its on an island so i had to get a boat
3287651 why go to l a i like whats going on here
3287652 my friends are here my family is here my home is here my cottage is up north im really happy here
3287653 im all for meeting new people but it can be awkward
3287654 they come up to you and theyre like hi michael how are you
3287655 basically we take opera out of its conventional form and bring it to the people make it more accessible for audiences who might be intimidated by going to the opera in a conventional setting like the opera house where youre so distanced from the scenery and the actors so our aim is to really bring it up close so that people feel what its like
3287656 it resembled sort of a cross between a versace fashion show and a hollywood premiere
3287657 we had a long red carpet that ran through the space the orchestra was almost on top of the audience the action was everywhere
3287658 it felt incredible it really felt like something exciting was beginning
3287659 ive always wanted to stage this particular production of pagliacci the setting is coney island on the day of the mermaid parade and id always conceived it to be staged inside a tent so it would be like a circus tent
3287660 when i staged things in new york the singers that were literally on my doorstep were phenomenal and everybody wants to work
3287661 i tried high and low to find someone who was not from too long a distance to cast i put notice out in edmonton and no one wanted to join the production so that was a real bummer
3287662 he was originally going to be an ensemble member because he sings but hes not very experienced on the operatic stage at all and it was a huge risk but i couldnt find a silvio
3287663 so hopefully this one will be such a smashing success that people will start throwing money at us

3287746 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients

3287750 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumours and alter our treatment goals accordingly

3287753 this report was fairly ugly and points to the growing body of evidence pointing to cooling in the canadian housing sector
3287754 the deceleration in the appreciation in the price of a new home is particularly pronounced given that two years ago prices were rising at a double digit pace
3287755 home builders are very concerned about the market turbulence in the months ahead
3287756 in recent months builders have reported much lower levels of new home sales activity job losses across the province as well as tightening credit conditions and negative media reports stemming from american housing markets are affecting consumer confidence
3287757 julys slide was triggered most notably by the apartment sector a sector which is more prone to irregular activity through the year
3287758 a slowing economy rising mortgage costs and more balanced resale markets will dampen the pace of new home construction moving closer to 2009
3287759 the construction timing of large scale high rise projects the kind that have dominated recent housing construction in toronto has routinely resulted in month over month starts volatility
3287760 canadian home builders have been putting up houses faster than the estimated household formation rate
3287761 year after year they have not able to provide the expected returns and have not even been able to set off losses leave aside earn revenue this has to stop as soon as possible
3287762 be it sail or any other public sector enterprises investments of very high order have been made in them
3287763 does it make any sense economically to increase capital outlay or investments in areas where even the minimum returns on investment were not realised or where even the repayment instalments could not be paid
3287764 such ventures need to be closed down sooner it is done the better it will be or they should be handed over to organisations that would be able to fetch decent returns thereon
3287765 the nation today faces a supply crunch of 80 000 megawatts the entire state of maharashtra faces the prospect of being without electricity for hours daily
3287766 it is largely because we have put in our scarce productive resources into unproductive loss making and unviable enterprises
3287767 if we divert resources out of such enterprises we could hope to meet our power requirements
3287768 the officer has been removed to the hospital for treatment
3287769 bill has gone through all the required channels now only is waiting for the finance minister to ask the speaker to move the bill
3287770 it will open investment of the pension money into the financial market that can optimise returns and cover them against high inflation levels
3287771 unless they have the numbers they wont bring it on the floor
3287772 all those who voted in the trust vote may not necessarily be wiling to vote for the bill
3287773 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3287774 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3287775 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children

3287783 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3287784 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3287785 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3287786 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3287787 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3287788 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

3287802 if stoke are serious about jon then they should make an offer if not then they should go away
3287803 he is an ipswich town footballer on a three year deal we dont want to sell him we want to keep him if stoke are showing serious intent in getting jon then they should do something about it
3287804 if not they should leave alone and let us get on with it
3287805 there has been no fall out that is all rumour
3287806 it is important that we sit down and talk i sit down with all my players
3287807 jon is a player that other people covet which is good for us because we have taken him from chester and he has done fantastically well
3287808 we have no reason to sell our best players we want to move on to the next level and we see no reason why john cant help us do that
3287809 we do for sure but we also need a bigger squad to finish seventh sixth fifth in the league
3287810 if we sign a few more players we will be a better and stronger team and so then we will have no choice but to try to finish higher and i feel we can do that
3287811 when you see the top four you see not just the best players in england but also some of the best players in the world
3287812 one of the main reasons they able to get them is money what they can spend in transfer fees and in wages
3287813 they also have the biggest squads you need to compete successfully in four competitions that is something the other clubs currently dont have
3287814 we already have great players in the squad david james sol campbell peter crouch all internationals but we would always welcome more anything to make the squad stronger
3287815 we know what we can both do and our record is quite good when you are talking about goals
3287816 it is still early days but we are kicking off next week with the game against chelsea and we can take a lot out of the game against united
3287817 it will be difficult at chelsea but it will be difficult for them too
3287818 i think if their manager watched the game today which i am sure he did then he will be thinking they will have a difficult game
3287819 it is up to the manager but we just need to focus on our club and get off to a good start
3287820 when the england squad gets selected then i am sure we will be ready
3287821 the england manager was at wembley and i think he knows what we can both do now

3287826 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody

3287831 foreigner became synonymous with enemy there was all this animosity directed towards any foreigner and at the same time there was an extraordinary outpouring of brotherly love within america we had this paradox that 9 11 led to intergroup harmony inside the united states while leading to intergroup conflict outside the united states
3287832 to the best of our knowledge this line of research is the first to document these relationships
3287833 our initial studies conducted during the week of the six month anniversary of 9 11 had americans read a u s senators policy on intergroup relations during this period of national challenge americans endorsed multiculturalism more as a domestic policy and assimilation more as a foreign policy
3287834 most recently we discovered that americans primed with 9 11 a foreign threat revealed higher levels of national identity than those primed with the columbine massacre a domestic threat

3287938 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
3287939 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward

3287944 realising that i had to set up an it system that was both scalable and robust enough to cope with massive data needs with a limited budget gave me a big headache
3287945 a supplier needed to convince me that they could deliver what they promised i knew intercept were on my wavelength when they explained how the system was setup when it could be delivered and the simple cost per user per month pricing model i liked the aggressive approach to getting things done thats something i can relate to

3287951 this survey is deliberately targeted at an age group that is being asked to choose its education and career path whilst this science statistic should worry uk plc and the governments of today and tomorrow the message is clear if we can educate them on the correlation between science and the gadgets they cant live without and spark their interest before choosing their gcse options we can influence the future of british industry
3287952 educators and private industry need to collaborate closely on how sciences are taught businesses worldwide are increasingly dependent upon technology to create new markets and achieve better margins technology is a lucrative thriving career option that seeks to drive down operational costs and increase innovation in a climate whereby the future careers of the realtime generation could be impacted by the credit crunch this is an opportune moment for the science and technology industry to reach out to this digital native workforce

3288122 i started to go over and this lady reached out and caught me
3288123 their way of dealing with me was to give me all kinds of drugs and to let me go
3288124 even to comb her hair and walk to the bathroom
3288125 i saw how upset my daughter was and heard my grandson say that i was deserting him so i decided that for as long as i have left im going to be sober and im going to deal with this pain and im going to do the best i can every day

3288138 wollen mittel bis langfristig wieder ein team mit perspektive aufbauen
3288139 wenn wir ber die gesamte saison unseren kader so zusammen behalten sind wir gut aufgestellt aber die konkurrenz ist unheimlich stark
3288140 die zun chst etwas problematische personalsituation hat sich durch die hinzu gekommenen jugendlichen deutlich entspannt seither ist gezieltes training m glich was sich auch in leistungen und ergebnissen widerspiegelte die letzten zwei drei wochen liefen nach plan wir haben gute spiele abgeliefert und ich denke die jungs gehen gut vorbereitet in die saison
3288141 da gibt es einige drei beispiele die jugendlichen julian koch und marcel kandziora sind in der abwehr bzw im mittelfeld echte alternativen dazu befindet sich sebastian tyrala k rperlich in einer viel besseren verfassung er arbeitet weit intensiver im training ist sehr konzentriert bei der sache und hat angedeutet dass wir ihn im angriff gut gebrauchen k nnen
3288142 alle drei haben sich als echte verst rkungen erwiesen bei lukas kruse im tor sieht man deutlich dass er ber erfahrung in der 2 liga verf gt er hat starke reflexe spielt gut mit und ist ein umsichtiger organisator damir vrancic hat in dieser ersten woche gleich best tigt was j rgen klopp ber ihn sagte er spielt im defensiven mittelfeld unspektakul r ist aber stark am ball beweist bersicht auch im passspiel nach vorn christopher kullmann schlie lich hat die in ihn gesetzten erwartungen voll erf llt ob als vorbereiter oder vollstrecker wir hatten im angriff probleme haben jetzt aber einen richtig guten mann hinzu bekommen ganz wichtig alle drei sind gute jungs und bereits vollst ndig integriert
3288143 wir hoffen auf marcel schmelzer und bajram sadrijaj allerdings sind sie im moment dort oben ziemlich nah dran k men sie zu uns w ren sie gesetzt daneben bauen wir auch auf patrick njambe nach seiner r ckkehr von den olympischen spielen und auf daniel gordon
3288144 wenn der kader so zusammenbleibt und sich noch weiter entwickelt sind wir ohne frage gut aufgestellt dann k nnen wir mittel bis langfristig wieder ein team mit perspektive aufbauen inwiefern sich aber personelle r ckschl ge verkraften lassen bleibt abzuwarten zum gl ck haben wir momentan mit ausnahme von lars ricken der ja vorerst nicht zur verf gung steht keine langwierigen verletzungen
3288145 ich erwarte wieder eine sehr enge liga in der vielleicht acht mannschaften ein wort im aufstiegsrennen mitreden k nnen wir wollen versuchen da mitzuhalten wobei rot weiss essen als hoher favorit gilt rwe hat sich f r unsere profis ber weite strecken als ein unangenehmer gegner erwiesen auch die leistungen von preu en m nster oder eintracht trier im pokal gegen bochum und hertha haben gezeigt welche qualit t in dieser spielklasse steckt nicht zu vergessen die starken nachwuchsabteilungen der bundesligisten k ln gladbach und leverkusen
3288146 wir wissen in der tat noch nicht so sehr viel ber die aus dem s dwesten gekommenen klubs mainz hat in der vorbereitung immerhin die s d regionalligisten ulm und darmstadt jeweils mit 1 0 bezwungen ein sicherlich unangenehmer gegner wir sind gewarnt

3288202 the fact that many sodas contain caffeine a stimulant is no secret on the contrary some soft drinks are being marketed on the basis of their high caffeine intake
3288203 too much caffeine can have serious consequences on health because it stimulates the release of adrenal hormones which can lead to a rise in blood pressure
3288204 another concern with soda is the high phosphorous to calcium ratio most soft drinks have very little to no calcium when we have too much phosphorus and not enough calcium the body will draw calcium from the bones in order to correct the imbalance in our bloodstream
3288205 this can eventually lead to osteoporosis as if that is not enough there is also the concern with other additives such as colour that are all too often found in soft drinks

3288210 do not stretch out your hand against the lad and do nothing to him for now i know that you fear god since you have not withheld your son your only son from me
3288211 in the mount of the lord it will be provided
3288212 by myself i have sworn declares the lord because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son your only son
3288213 in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed because you have obeyed my voice

3288229 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3288230 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3288231 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3288232 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3288233 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3288234 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3288235 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3288236 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3288237 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3288238 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3288239 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3288240 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3288241 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3288242 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3288243 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3288244 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3288245 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3288246 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3288247 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3288248 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3288249 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3288250 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3288251 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3288252 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3288253 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3288254 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3288255 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3288256 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3288257 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3288258 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3288259 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3288260 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3288261 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3288262 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3288263 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3288264 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3288265 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3288266 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3288267 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3288268 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3288269 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3288270 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3288271 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3288272 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3288273 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3288274 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3288275 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3288276 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3288277 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3288278 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3288279 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3288280 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3288281 despu s de varios meses consecutivos de alza los datos de julio muestran una estabilizaci n
3288282 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3288283 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3288284 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3288285 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3288286 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3288287 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3288288 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3288289 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3288290 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3288291 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3288292 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3288293 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3288294 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3288295 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3288296 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3288297 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3288298 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3288299 who are open to doing something on the production side
3288300 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3288301 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3288302 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3288303 people think it takes hard work to produce high level athletes it doesnt take hard work producing high level athletes takes play
3288304 people think it takes hard work to produce high level athletes it doesnt take hard work producing high level athletes takes play
3288305 people think it takes hard work to produce high level athletes it doesnt take hard work producing high level athletes takes play
3288306 people think it takes hard work to produce high level athletes it doesnt take hard work producing high level athletes takes play
3288307 japanese high school girls engage in compensated dates with middle aged men
3288308 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3288309 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3288310 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3288311 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3288312 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3288313 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3288314 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3288315 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3288316 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3288317 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3288328 simply put this is a case about a scheme to conceal largely through the submission of false financial disclosure forms to the united states senate
3288329 created reviewed signed and filed in the district of columbia and a substantial portion of stevens scheme to conceal occurred in or around the district of columbia
3288330 a minimal opportunity to personally participate in the electoral process that will decide his professional future
3288331 vocally proclaimed his innocence of the crimes charged against him
3288332 continue to offer explanations and characterizations of the factual and legal issues in the case
3288333 the girdwood residence is not the scene of the crimes but is rather merely the subject of some but not all of the defendants false statements
3288334 whether stevens knew he received more than 250 in benefits from a source that he did not repay
3288335 although stevens maintains a residence in alaska there can be no legitimate dispute that for all practical purposes he lives and works in the district of columbia his spouse is an attorney at a law firm in the district of columbia and the family owns a personal residence in the district of columbia
3288336 i said wendy if youve got any control get on the end of that barrel and guide at least one bb for her

3288343 i took three or four times as long as i usually do to shoot i walked up on the station took a really deep breath and asked god to give me this chance
3288344 i dont think i ever forgot what was on the line it was a matter of managing my fear

3288409 its more vulnerable so you have to be extra cautious about what you do its closer to the edge than it was

3288452 i will miss him and his contribution to the entertainment world and to human kind
3288453 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with i know one can never put a question mark where god puts a period so i will not question the almightys decision to call him home we all know when that call comes we all will answer
3288454 personally my buddy will be missed for many reasons by me he was family he will be a part of my musical life each time i sing the song d j vu as this was a birthday gift to me from him
3288455 his renditions of songs that i had recorded especially walk on by in my opinion the definitive version will always be another memory each time i sing it and the humorous side that he showed few that i knew so well

3288465 there were some paf civilians as well travelling in the vehicle we are trying to ascertain exactly how many were inside

3288468 the reason weve picked him is because were confident hell play

3288473 as robots enter our everyday life they need to have sensors everywhere on their bodies like humans

3288475 it could be completely integrated into the normal driving system making users unaware of using it
3288476 objects that come into contact with humans are often not square or flat we believe interfaces between humans and electronics should be soft
3288477 we cant rule out the possibility of using this in living bodies but were sticking to using it in electronics

3288482 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3288483 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3288484 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3288485 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3288486 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience

3288488 this is an insult to the real singer and to all the people who listened
3288489 absolutely that will be the case after a five year period in term why wouldnt that be the case
3288490 weve got to be mature enough to handle that and deal with it

3288495 if we continue to improve with young players playing well were heading in the right direction

3288503 yet if we eliminate from the start any notion that big facts like imperial domination can be applied mechanically and deterministically to such complex matters as culture and ideas then we will begin to approach an interesting kind of study my idea is that european and american interest in the orient was political according to some of the obvious historical accounts of it that i have given here but that it was culture that created that interest that acted dynamically along with brute political economic and military rationales to make the orient the varied and complicated place that it obviously was in the field i call orientalism therefore orientalism is not a mere political subject matter or field that is passively reflected by culture scholarship or institutions nor is it a large and diffuse collection of texts about the orient nor is it representative and expressive of some nefarious western imperialist plot to hold down the oriental world it is rather a distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic scholarly economic sociological historical and philological texts it is an elaboration not only of a basic geographical distinction the world is made up of two unequal halves orient and occident but also of a whole series of interests which by such means as scholarly discovery philological reconstruction psychological analysis landscape and sociological description it not only creates but also maintains it is rather than expresses a certain will or intention to understand in some cases to control manipulate even to incorporate what is a manifestly different or alternative and novel world it is above all a discourse that is by no means in direct corresponding relationship with political power in the raw but rather is produced and exists in an uneven exchange with various kinds of power shaped to a degree by the exchange with power political as with a colonial or imperial establishment power intellectual as with reigning sciences like comparatative linguistivs or anatomy or any of the modern policy sciences power cultural as with orthodoxies and canons of taste texts values power moral as with ideas about what we do and what they cannot do or understand as we do

3288518 look at it this way love is love sometimes homosexuals can show a kind of love that is even purer than the kind of love straight people have straight couples fight and quarrel so do homosexuals love is love who is to say who you can or cannot fall in love with sometimes homosexuals can teach us a thing or two about love because they may sometimes be more affectionate than the rest of us

3288521 absolutely but i also believe that for those that do not they may fail to include into their buying decision the vital role that population trends have on our economy and the county in which we live it is by carefully analyzing these figures that we can reasonably predict future housing demands
3288522 with an increase in future housing demands and a limited supply of land to build on existing home prices are likely to appreciate in the foreseeable future
3288523 investors recognize this and are patient enough to wait awhile to reap the rewards your average homebuyer is more emotionally connected with the day to day value versus the future value thus missing out on future equity appreciation

3288580 im very satisfied about the way the squad played in the summer friendlies especially against manchester united fc
3288581 we showed our defensive strength and overcame a stern test against the european champions there is no better way to approach the game against artmedia moreover we can count on gianluigi buffon he adds value to the rest of the squad
3288582 it will be a huge experience for me and of course for all the team i am only 21 the last time that artmedia played in the champions league group stage i only sat on the bench now i am in a different position i will really enjoy the moment when i stand on the pitch beside such a hero as gianluigi buffon
3288583 they are a big team with great individuals but we want to go there to fight for our chance not to be there and just playing football we want to cause a surprise
3288584 i believe that we are ready for the challenge of this game
3288585 we are getting better every time we run on to the pitch
3288586 without doubt this a hard game for us we are up against a big club with a big history but i still feel that our chances are 50 50 the team which shows its worth on the pitch will be one that goes through crvena zvezda are a great team but apoel are also a great team with a great history in cyprus
3288587 we will first of all be aiming not to concede at home
3288588 we will also need a little luck and if we manage to score at the other end that will also suit us well

3288639 the rise of china in particular represents the great unfolding drama of this new century
3288640 will china democratise how will china respond to climate change
3288641 and how will chinese culture adjust to the array of global influences now washing across its shores directly and through the agency of the greater chinese diaspora
3288642 its misleading its snake oil salesmanship of the worst order
3288643 were gonna drill offshore were gonna drill here and were gonna drill now
3288644 we have to drill here and drill now drill here and drill now
3288645 because oil prices are determined on the international market any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
3288646 our energy plan will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future so that no young american in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the middle east
3288647 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3288648 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3288649 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live
3288650 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3288651 as far as we are concerned we let off the fireworks thats whats important to us
3288652 all of a sudden just before theres a potential announcement theyre raising last minute issues which quite frankly have been addressed have been discussed and we now have support not only from the australian workers union but certainly public sentiment is behind us on this issue

3288656 we must protect ourselves from the global warming top scientists in colorado believe that global warming will strike two days before the day after tomorrow
3288657 its great to see others getting involved especially in events that are so competitive
3288658 when i first saw the time i thought they had made a mistake
3288659 it was a very fast time when i saw the 1 by my name i thought they had made a mistake then i saw my name there and i realized that id got it
3288660 i didnt know what anyone else was doing being so far away from everyone
3288661 really the race was for second i got what i hoped for
3288662 i knew if i jumped first the guys in the middle of the pool wouldnt be able to see me
3288663 by the time they did hopefully id have enough ground where i could hold them off
3288664 im just going to go back get some rest and some food in my system recover back at the village and prepare for tomorrow
3288665 that boy had a big dick and gave it to me good
3288666 thats when you get a skinny boy and a big girl and i grab your ass and hold you inside me
3288667 i love the public and love to work with people
3288668 how difficult it is to be palestinian and how difficult it is for a palestinian to be a writer or a poet how can he achieve literary freedom in such slavish conditions and how can he preserve the literariness of literature in such brutal times
3288669 a land on the brink of dawn let us not quarrel about the number of those whove died here they lie together furnishing the grass for us that we should be reconciled
3288670 cultures are in reality super life forms that is they are organic in nature and like all organisms must pass through the phases of birth life death
3288671 was one ancient institution no less evil than war which the western civilization had got rid of a society which had succeeded in abolishing slavery might surely take heart from this unprecedented victory of a christian ideal
3288672 in the hearts of the dominant white majority a christian conscience had insisted on abolishing negro slavery
3288673 the more fat i lose the lighter i get one day i may even just float to the finish line

3288682 we the leaders of once captive nations of eastern europe and now eu and nato members estonia latvia lithuania and poland express a deep concern over the russian federations actions toward georgia
3288683 self exams are no longer recommended in denmark as they have no benefits only harms
3288684 doctors should not recommend harmful interventions with no proven benefits they should explain to the women that self examination is such an intervention
3288685 the conclusion of the study that the data does not support using bse as a good screening test for breast cancer is correct the randomized studies are large and well done
3288686 i have many patients who confess that doing a breast self exam increases their anxiety considerably some of the smartest and most reasonable ones decided long ago to stop examining their breasts they were right
3288687 the new guidelines recommending that women not perform bse could seriously endanger womens health and lead to later detection of cancers in some women these guidelines do not reflect a new point of view but they are still very bad advice
3288688 the new guidelines recommending that women not perform breast self examinations could seriously endanger womens health and lead to later detection of cancers in some women
3288689 we have not measured the impact of actually teaching or advising women to not exam their breasts what are the downstream effects of such advice what other health maintenance interventions may get devalued as a consequence lets hope the review has no effect
3288690 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3288691 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3288692 the first thing i tell my clients is that this is not something that is abnormal
3288693 theres nothing wrong with you if you get nervous when you have to do public speaking the important thing is not to run away from it
3288694 i said manage because i believe there is a benefit to having a certain level of concern about public speaking its what you do with it thats important
3288695 most people will do anything they can to avoid taking the time to prepare
3288696 but if you are willing to make a commitment the results will pay off for you
3288697 if its a small group talk to people in advance
3288698 ask them questions about what they are expecting the more information you have at your disposal that is pertinent to your subject the less chance there is that you will be embarrassed which is what a fear of public speaking is
3288699 its almost like having a road map and seeing the destination
3288700 many times when you have the end that helps drive everything that comes before it then i try to think what are the two or three key pieces of information i most want the audience to hold on to and be able to use
3288701 your opening should be like a handshake that reaches out and really connects with your audience
3288702 that would be incorrect presentation skills are the only thing
3288703 whatever your opening was your closing should have some relationship to it
3288704 youre saying to your audience youve got everything you need to go out there and do whatever it is that i told you to do
3288705 what practice isnt is just thinking about it in your head
3288706 you dont ever want to be caught in a situation where you didnt prepare enough because they want you to talk for 45 minutes and youre only prepared for 15 minutes
3288707 you can be slightly under and fill in with questions and answers but you never want to exceed
3288708 you have to be comfortable with silence and knowing when to stop speaking to let a message sit out there and let people process information
3288709 youre giving the audience a subliminal message this is important
3288710 i welcome the anxiety because i know its my brain and bodys way of signaling that i need to get ready to do something new and exciting
3288711 i can shift it easily and it doesnt move or flap around
3288712 i want people to feel good and to be relaxed
3288713 the more they relax the more they absorb when they absorb more the more likely it is they will act on the things im suggesting and get great results
3288714 you should know what you are going to talk about who you will speak to and under what conditions you will speak
3288715 that doesnt mean to memorize exactly what you plan to say rather it is to have a good outline of facts and information that you can talk about
3288716 then when you walk up to the lectern thank the person who introduced you and then count to 10 before you start speaking this will allow the audience to get settled in and ready to hear you it is also a way that you are showing that you are now in control
3288717 they really dont care if you mess up or lose your place they dont care if you look at your notes and they dont expect you to start with a joke they know it could just as easily be them up there and they are rooting for you so make what the audience learns more important than how you appear when you are providing the information
3288718 i dramatically improved my listening skills and how i think and organize my message to meet the listeners needs
3288719 typically we are not thinking about what the listener needs we are thinking about what we have to say
3288720 i am aware of this positive dope test all i know is that it was an out of competition test that took place some time last week
3288721 she arrived in the first group of spanish athletes on july 31 it seems the same day she arrived she had a drug test and after that had a panic attack and asked the cycling federation to be allowed to return to madrid
3288722 even though her state of health is good she does not feel ready to justify or explain her reasons for leaving the village
3288723 you have no idea how we sat up at night
3288724 we are still hiring for this year with several jobs open in critical areas
3288725 we expect to have all positions filled but we wont have a surplus
3288726 if in fact a google property is taking money away from googles partners that is a real problem
3288727 the question in peoples minds is how unbiased can google be as it grows and grows and grows
3288728 when you see knol pages rank high they are there because they have earned their position
3288729 our vision still remains to be the best conduit that we can be connecting people between whatever their search is and the answer they are looking for
3288730 for that reason we are not interested in owning or creating content
3288731 our job which is to organize that information kicks in
3288732 google can say they are not in the content business but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work it is getting harder to make that case
3288733 they are competing for talent for advertisers and for users
3288734 assuming that google treats knol just like it treats other web sites it is just another company out there producing content
3288735 we participated in google knol as a test as weve done with other similar offerings
3288736 we are evaluating its effectiveness in further building brand awareness for webmd
3288737 you are continuing to build their business if you do that versus building your own
3288738 if i am a content provider and i depend upon google as a mechanism to drive traffic to me should i fear that they may compete with me in the future
3288739 a lot of the issues that we saw play out between microsoft and its ecosystem in the 1990s will play out again between google and its ecosystem
3288740 we planned our wedding around the 04 olympics we planned our little girl being born at the end of 06 when 07 wasnt as busy
3288741 if its soon after their retirement maybe theyre appealing to and familiar to a much broader audience
3288742 you may be able to keep that going for a while but it would generally probably diminish over time
3288743 as it diminishes i think the opportunities are still there but the market gets more and more restricted
3288744 make or break if you want to do business with at amp t for example
3288745 its a one time thing that if it goes well will mean youll have repeat opportunities in the future
3288746 the majority are not going to get multimillion dollar endorsements
3288747 my goal is to work with a number of sponsors not just at the olympic games but more importantly even afterwards
3288748 and to get those things off the ground its important to get sponsorship
3288749 they seem to resonate because they let us almost escape to what we believe to have been a better time in sports
3288750 we are human beings and then we grow up and we age like anybody else
3288751 by the end of the year spitz is going to make seven figures
3288752 i always pitch for my family thats why im playing to help support them
3288753 youre tired and youre all those things but to be able to do that a day after having a baby is really special you get a little bit extra when youre in a situation like that
3288754 yeah weve had some struggles the past few games but i believe in our guys and i believe were going to turn it around
3288755 its just a matter of time before someone gets that big hit and it goes the other way
3288756 its something weve got to take care of pretty quick
3288757 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3288758 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3288759 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3288760 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that

3288774 does highlight a trend with other studies linking shortages of vitamin d to increased rates of breast cancer and depression in the elderly
3288775 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3288776 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3288777 our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously

3288784 america has two great dominant strands of political thought conservatism which at its very best draws lines that should not be crossed and progressivism which at its very best breaks down barriers that should never have been erected
3288785 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3288786 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3288787 going off this week i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place he should be at myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time i just think this is not the time to do that
3288788 hawaii is somewhat of an odd place to be doing it i know that he is from hawaii grew up there his grandmother lives there but he has made such a point about how he is from kansas and um you know the boy from kansas and kenya and um it makes him seem just a little more exotic than he would perhaps want to come across as at this stage of the presidential campaign
3288789 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
3288790 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters
3288791 we have people here from all religions and cultural backgrounds some of whom may feel uncomfortable or offended with condoms in their room
3288792 no one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment
3288793 people are encouraged to take the leaflets and to take as many as they like they can use them or take them home for friends and spread the knowledge and awareness

3288806 you can not feel love for another unless you feel love for yourself
3288807 these fucking things are a rip off why do you drag me to them every time
3288808 because people think you are weird ethan and i am beginning to agree with them
3288809 you have always thought i was strange why are you suddenly taking notice
3288810 humor me will you it will give us something to laugh about at the next class reunion
3288811 its alright i hear it all the time there are many non believers in dr logan out there but i can say she has truly changed my life and i feel honored to be on her staff
3288812 ah thank you you were always so nice and sweet
3288813 its ok ethan i am used it and actually find the attention quite flattering
3288814 just heard you were in town and thought we would pop in and say hello
3288815 lets just say you and i have different philosophies on life
3288816 its simple stop complaining about how bad everything is and just deal with it blame is just an excuse for not being happy
3288817 as happy as anyone else people have certain idealistic perceptions of what happy really means to me if i can stand up out of bed in the morning and breathe then that is all the happiness i need everything else is just extra
3288818 then why does it bother you so much being here
3288819 it doesnt bother me what does bother me is the fact you are selling people false hope the try this and your life will be better approach does not work only people can make their lives better not gimmicks and slogans if you dont like what you are doing quit your job and find one you do like if you dont like who you are with leave them dont stay just because you dont want to hurt the other person all of these things are things you preach against
3288820 not true i simply supply people with alternatives to where they are in life
3288821 no you provide people with an unrealistic hope that they can be happier without changing anything
3288822 it does not work that way in order for your life to change you have to make the change not have some doctor tell you to do it
3288823 no no its alright emma i understand how he feels this way what he does not realize is that his anger at me has nothing to do with what i do but instead ethan is unhappy with his own life and is using this anger as a way to deflect his attention from this unhappiness
3288824 thats it i am not going to stand here and listen to this crap madison i will see you at the class reunion next year emma i will be at the car waiting
3288825 well that was just about the rudest things i have ever seen
3288826 hey i told you i did not want to come here you knew that all along yet you still insisted on dragging me here do you expect me stand there and take that crap from her you should know me better than that
3288827 i do know you and that is the problem i know you too well because no one else would take the crap that i put up with dealing with you she wants to help you and you are to damn stubborn to see that
3288828 help me with what i am happy with my life the way it is thank you very much i dont need help from some self proclaimed guru she and all her followers are nothing but a group of phonies her are too insecure about their own lives to deal with it and instead like to make others feel just as bad sorry i dont need that i am perfectly content to get up everyday go to work and go home that is all i need and if you can not see that that is your problem not mine
3288829 youre right ethan it is not your problem nothing is ever your problem
3288830 you better stop right there i just choose to live in a world that makes sense and i can control i has nothing to do with being self centered it has everything to do with wanted to have some normalcy
3288831 but with that normalcy you lose any thrill of living when was the last time you did something just do it without having to plan every little step out your life is lived at some robotic pace and you dont even seem to care
3288832 at least i am not so desperate for people to like me that i become fake
3288833 fake youre calling me fake oh thats a good one
3288834 you really think i need to i mean i have handled matters more complicated than this without using these guys
3288835 that was business my friend this is personal dont get involved let them handle it
3288836 well better pack it up because next week the new tenants may not have your same taste
3288837 dude its just a regular cup i can grab one at any store
3288838 fuck you will you know damn well its more than that its all i have left
3288839 man you have to call them you know you do
3288840 what the fuck are you talking about too soon its been two years man two years in this place and you still dont get it make the call and get it over with
3288841 it wasnt that hard to figure out you checked out of the hotel and no one has seen you all day you are not answering your phone and all you talked about was getting away so putting the pieced together did not take brain surgery we live in a small town there is only one way out
3288842 i have to go its been 5 months since i signed those papers and not a damn thing has changed the last payment from the sale came in today so i have nothing left to stay around for this town has bled every ounce of life out of me and i have to start new
3288843 look man we all feel like running away sometimes but it does not work the problems you
3288844 the fact that you have a nice wife and kids to go home too every night while i have nothing but the glow of a television the fact that you have a great job in a great company while i was forced to sell mine because of that bitch is that the problems you are talking about because if it is dont preach to me about this because you will never understand what it is like to wake up in the middle of the night and realize that you have no reason to even step foot out of bed the next morning you will never grasp the realization that you have peaked at age 30
3288845 you think you are the only one in the world with problems i have a hell of a lot more to worry about than you i have a mortgage and all that goes along with that that great job you mentioned well it comes with long hours and hard work dont stand there to tell me i have it so much better than you you think there are times i dont want to hop on one of these buses damn right there are but i have realized that i am grown up now with responsibilities maybe if you would realize that you would not be standing here
3288846 so after 15 years of friendship thats all you have to say to me
3288847 i mean just that if you were to look up at that board
3288848 and picked one place you could go to right now where would be it

3288888 basically fundamentally television was a performers medium and news and current affairs were the sideshow
3288889 one of the reasons that i honestly believe that the care taken on light entertainment had to be the same care as was taken for ballet or opera or serious drama is because you are contributing to the culture of the country i think its sad if it isnt
3288890 its a very sad day to lose him he knew about the business he knew about television
3288891 he was responsible for what i think was the golden age of bbc television which well never have again
3288892 he knew how to treat performers he knew how to talk to them how to get them to do things even if they didnt want to he talked them into it because he knew it would be good for them
3288893 without him i dont think the show would have gone on he undoubtedly had a nose for a hit
3288894 he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us absolutely to the hilt
3288895 he was an entrepreneur and theres not many of his type about any more im afraid we shall miss him terribly i loved him

3288930 i think regardless of who is president we are still going to have a military presence in iraq by 2012 its not like vietnam you cant just walk away leaving it to go to hell with everybody killing one another as bad as that was it had no geopolitical cost at all for americans the costs of failure were zero whereas the geopolitical cost of running away here is almost unimaginable not only would a full scale regional civil war create all sorts of opportunities for iran it creates all sorts of opportunities for the iranian backed shiah and the wildest sunni radicals who are behind al qaeda it makes your most important ally in the region israel desperately vulnerable

3288946 those who emigrated had the most to gain from the move and were likely therefore to be the most responsible to labor market conditions by emigrating when young they were able to reap the gains over most of their working lives by moving as single individuals they were able to minimize the costs of the move including earnings forgone in passage and during job search
3288947 since we are dealing with a process whose every element takes considerable time in revealing its true features and ultimate effects there is no point in appraising the performance of that process ex visu of a given point in time we must judge its performance over time as it unfolds through decades or centuries
3288948 in order to pursue an economic analysis without distraction well need to abandon or at least agree to temporarily ignore the gift culture level of explanation

3288995 so erfreulich grunds tzlich der wenn auch geringe r ckgang der kriminalit t insgesamt in wien derzeit ist so darf dar ber vor allem wegen des starken anstiegs bei einigen deliktgruppen nicht vergessen werden dass die wirksamste pr ventionen vor verbrechen eine ausreichende zahl an polizistinnen in den bezirken ist
3288996 dieser schritt ist zu begr en allerdings ist die angek ndigte zahl viel zu gering betr gt sie doch nur ein drittel des j hrlichen abgangs von 150 polizeimitarbeiterinnen unber cksicht dabei sind die hunderten polizistinnen denen vor jahren eine r ckkehrm glichkeit in ihr heimatbundesland zugesagt wurde in summe braucht wien unbedingt mindestens 1 000 polizistinnen mehr
3288997 wenn innenministerin fekter und vor allem finanzminister molterer die entsch rfung des enorm gestiegenen arbeitsdrucks bei den wiener polizistinnen und eine im interesse der b rgerinnen liegende erh hung der sicherheit wirklich ein herzensanliegen ist so m ssen sie endlich den weg f r deutlich mehr polizistinnen in wien freimachen allein mit den besuch von polizeiinspektionen vordringlich in wahlkampfzeiten ist es nicht getan
3288998 wiener vp chef hahn hat sich inhaltlich aus wien verabschiedet
3288999 der wiener vp chef johannes hahn hat sich in seinem ministerjob schon lange aus wien verabschiedet man merkt an seinen heutigen aussagen dass er bei themen wie geb hren oder auch kinderg rten keine seri sen informationen hat bzw weitergeben m chte
3289000 tatsache ist wien schie t zu seinen geb hreneinnahmen j hrlich rund eine halbe milliarde euro zu um die hohen leistungen f r die daseinsvorsorge zu sichern nur f nf der insgesamt 32 geb hren der stadt sind kostendeckend von einer berdeckung bei den wiener geb hren kann also keine rede sein
3289001 wien weist im vergleich mit allen anderen st dten in sterreich die l ngsten ffnungszeiten und die geringsten schlie tage auf die kindergarten beitr ge sind in wien sozial gestaffelt wodurch einem drittel der eltern gar keine kosten f r die betreuung entstehen weitere 40 prozent zahlen einen erm igten beitrag aber das l sst die vp immer wieder sehr bewusst unter den tisch fallen
3289002 offensichtlich ist es die linie der vp die menschen mit falschen informationen in die irre zu f hren
3289003 zukunftstr chtige investitionen in die verkehrsinfrastruktur sind wichtig f r die regionale entwicklung aber auch f r lebensqualit t und verkehrssicherheit
3289004 die nunmehr von sp und vp versp tet erzielte einigung ber eine anhebung des pflegegeldes ist nicht ann hernd das was die pflegebed rftigen in sterreich mit fug und recht erwarten
3289005 die fp fordert unver ndert eine inflationsabgeltung des pflegegeldes das wegen langj hriger nichtanpassung bereits einen kaufkraftverlust von 20 prozent aufweist die jetzt vorgesehene erh hung von 4 bis 6 prozent bedeutet also durchschnittlich immer noch einen realen verlust von 15 prozent f r die betroffenen was von sp und vp offenbar als wahlkampfzuckerl gedacht war ist in wahrheit eine weitere bittere pille f r die pflegebed rftigen menschen in sterreich
3289006 w hrend st p ltens bgm matthias stadler nach dem glanzstoff brand wochen verstreichen lie bis erste schritte eingeleitet wurden agiert man bei der medialen interpretation eines bescheides des unabh ngigen verwaltungssenates uvs in rekordzeit und vergi t dabei anscheinend darauf den bescheid auch zu lesen auch hier wird wieder deutlich wie unbeholfen der b rgermeister agiert
3289007 der bescheid liest sich wie eine pannenstatistik schwerwiegende verfahrensm ngel kein parteiengeh r fehlende gutachen usw unter zu hilfe name der sachverst ndigen des landes und der einhaltung der verfahrensvorschriften h tte vom b rgermeister ein bescheid erlassen werden k nnen der der berpr fung durch den uvs standgehalten h tte daf r h tte die stadt ein sogenanntes nderungsverfahren anwenden m ssen und dieses sofort nach dem brand durchf hren m ssen ein verfahren dass in anderen f llen in st p lten brigens schon in rekordzeit zur erfolgreichen anwendung gekommen ist im fall glanzstoff wurde gez gert gezaudert und falsch gehandelt eillige presseaussendungen k nnen an diesem umstand leider nichts mehr ndern

3289013 listen how many times do i have to tell you i have not seen or heard from him in 10 years nor do i have any plans to do either soon so you can ask me all you want in as many different ways as you want but the answer will be the same i have no idea where william michaels is and i have no desire to found out
3289014 remember you can have a lawyer present if you want one
3289015 you two are amazing you know that how long did you come up with this little routine i mean granted i have seen it done better in the keystone cops but i am glad to see the academy is putting out such fine upstanding agents i am sure somewhere in that mound of paperwork in front of you there is a file that will tell you i hold two degrees one in political science and the other in criminal forensic psychology so to answer your rather irritating question yes i am aware i can have a lawyer but since i am not charged with anything and came here on my own free will i dont feel i need one now do i
3289016 since you seem to be the brains of the operation
3289017 tell me are you going to charge me with something or can i leave
3289018 knock it off mr marshall i am assistant d a casey and you are free to leave i am sorry you have been kept this long
3289019 hold on one second we are not finished with him
3289020 agent peterson i can only assume that you do not enough on mr marshall to charge him so before he wises up and puts his law knowledge to work and decides to file a lawsuit let him leave
3289021 mr marshall would you please wait for me in the hallway
3289022 die eu kommission plant den zugang zu gesundheitsleistungen f r b rger anderer eu staaten mit negativen auswirkungen f r die vorarlberger zu vereinfachen bislang muss jeder der gesundheitsleistungen in einem anderen eu land in anspruch nehmen will die genehmigung seiner heimischen sozialversicherung einholen diese h rde will die eu kommission abschaffen und w rde damit einen enormen druck auf die gesundheitseinrichtungen der eu nettozahler aus ben schon mit der bisherigen regelung kommt es immer wieder zu verz gerungen bei der grenz berschreitenden abrechnung von leistungen die neue regelung sorgt nicht nur f r noch kompliziertere verh ltnisse sondern auch zu einer berlastung unseres heimischen gut ausgebauten gesundheitssystems
3289023 ich unterst tze vollumf nglich die kritik der vorarlberger landesregierung gegen die planungen der eu kommission handelt es sich doch um eine erneute aufgezwungene richtlinie der eu die mehr nachteile als vorteile f r die betroffenen bringt
3289024 die eu sollte sich statt immer mehr dem zentralisierungswahn zu verfallen endlich um eine echte regionalisierung in den meisten politikfeldern bem hen
3289025 diese investition versorgt uns dank der fixen langj hrigen mietvereinbarung mit stabilen eink nften dar ber hinaus sehen wir tschechien als attraktiven markt mit nachhaltiger stabilit t
3289026 die familienbeihilfe ist seit dem 1 1 2000 nicht mehr erh ht worden das hei t es gibt hier auch keine inflationsanpassung seit 2000 daher glaube ich es ist ein gebot der stunde diese direkte f rderung an die familien auch tats chlich zu erh hen
3289027 mit einer erh hung der familienbeihilfe und der steuerlichen absetzbarkeit von kinderbetreuungskosten wollen wir ganz gezielt familien mit mittlerem und niedrigem einkommen entlasten und st rken
3289028 die familienbeihilfe ist seit 2000 nicht erh ht worden im selben zeitraum ist der verbraucherpreisindex um 14 6 prozent angestiegen
3289029 das werden wir auch im zuge der steuerreform diskutieren und angehen
3289030 diese f rderung w re zu breit und zu teuer wir w rden vor allem kinderreiche familien in schlechten einkommensverh ltnissen besonders f rdern das w ren zum beispiel ausl nderfamilien die traditionell viele kinder haben das ist zwar sch n und gut kann aber nicht der alleinige focus dieser steuerreform sein
3289031 eine erh hung von beihilfen hat nichts mit einer steuerentlastung zu tun
3289032 in den letzten 15 jahren ist das pflegegeld erst drei mal und zwar 1994 1995 und zuletzt 2005 erh ht worden jetzt ist es allerh chste zeit der pensionistenverband begr t die initiative von sozialminister buchinger ab 1 1 2009 das pflegegeld um 5 prozent anzuheben
3289033 unser vorschlag ist daher 5 prozent erh hung des pflegegelds ber alle stufen und besondere zuschl ge f r demenzerkrankte personen und schwerbehinderte kinder und jugendliche
3289034 400 000 bezieherinnen von pflegegeld und ihre familien brauchen diese erh hung gerade jetzt da die inflation immer neue rekorde erreicht d rfen wir die betroffenen nicht warten lassen
3289035 wenn minister buchinger meint dass eine einmaligen erh hung des pflegegeldes in dieser periode bis einschlie lich 2010 um 3 prozent die situation pflegebed rftiger menschen bessert kann ich ihm nur eine deutliche absage erteilen
3289036 bukan mudah untuk melaksanakan perkara sebegini apa yang boleh dikatakan kami sedang megadakan persiapan terakhir ke arahnya
3289037 saya akan umumkan bila tiba masanya jangan risau buat masa ini saya tidak boleh beritahu saya tidak mahu saiful berasa tertekan jika semua orang terus mendesaknya

3289042 kami mendesak agar menteri besar memohon maaf dan menarik balik kenyataan tersebut syor 10 peratus tempat di uitm dibuka kepada bukan bumiputera
3289043 kita telah merancang pelan tindakan secara terpeinci susulan fasa kedua dan ketiga akan diteruskan termasuk memohon perkenan tuanku canselor tuanku mizan zainal abidin bertitah agar uitm tidak diganggu
3289044 kita melihat ini adalah taktik pihak tertentu menjelang pilihanraya kecil di permatang pauh nanti
3289045 sekiranya tujuannya ialah untuk itu politik maka tolonglah hentikan kerana telah termaktub dalam perkara 153 perlembagaan persekutuan yang ditubuhkan khas untuk bumiputera
3289046 saya amat tidak bersetuju kerana telah terbukti seperti apa yang berlaku di universiti universiti lain setiap kaum tertentu hanya akan bergaul dengan kaum mereka sendiri
3289047 ini bukan persaingan yang sihat keadaan ini lebih bahaya jika wujudnya perasaan mementingkan kaum sendiri walaupun belajar dalam satu institusi
3289048 kepentingan kita diperingkat pelajar sekarang ialah agar dapat mewujudkan jaringan hubungan dua hala dengan pelajar antarabangsa pada masa masa akan datang
3289049 kami komuniti pelajar uitm membantah keras pandangan membuka uitm sedemikian
3289050 kami mendapati alasan bahawa tindakan mengkhaskan uitm hanya kepada masyarakat bumiputera menyebabkan pelajar bumiputera kurang berinteraksi dan sebagainya adalah tidak benar
3289051 selepas ini kami akan menyerahkan memorandum yang serupa kepada perdana menteri dan kemudian yang di pertuan agong yang juga canselor uitm ini akan dilakukan minggu depan
3289052 sehingga malam ini isnin kami sudah memperoleh tandatangan menyokong memorandum bantahan daripada lebih 5 000 pelajar dan ia mungkin akan mencecah 10 000 orang esok
3289053 memorandum ini bertujuan meminta beliau menteri besar selangor menarik balik kenyataannya kerana bertentangan dengan prinsip penubuhan uitm sebagai sebuah institusi pengajian tinggi bagi melahirkan profesional di kalangan bumiputera
3289054 maaf saya tak dapat nak beri komen mengenai perkara ini sehingga menteri pengajian tinggi membuat kenyataan rasmi mengenai perkara ini

3289080 this report was fairly ugly and points to the growing body of evidence pointing to cooling in the canadian housing sector
3289081 the deceleration in the appreciation in the price of a new home is particularly pronounced given that two years ago prices were rising at a double digit pace
3289082 home builders are very concerned about the market turbulence in the months ahead
3289083 in recent months builders have reported much lower levels of new home sales activity job losses across the province as well as tightening credit conditions and negative media reports stemming from american housing markets are affecting consumer confidence
3289084 julys slide was triggered most notably by the apartment sector a sector which is more prone to irregular activity through the year
3289085 a slowing economy rising mortgage costs and more balanced resale markets will dampen the pace of new home construction moving closer to 2009
3289086 the construction timing of large scale high rise projects the kind that have dominated recent housing construction in toronto has routinely resulted in month over month starts volatility
3289087 canadian home builders have been putting up houses faster than the estimated household formation rate
3289088 we greatly appreciate the opportunity to invest in a world class company like mega brands one of the worlds leading toy brands

3289099 there is a big lack of buying interest in gold
3289100 gold is going to have a hard time getting any sustainable traction to move higher
3289101 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3289102 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3289103 it has become clear that demand is cratering which is making it hard to rally
3289104 its hard to imagine that the market will shrug off the potential loss of 1 million barrels a day of pretty good quality crude but that appears to be the case
3289105 i think we are looking at a significant change in market sentiment
3289106 we are really only focusing on the bearish aspects of a dramatic slowdown in demand and increased supplies

3289139 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3289140 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3289141 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3289142 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3289143 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3289144 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3289145 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3289146 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3289153 you said exactly the same thing and the only difference is that you are my friend that is going to affect me more because you are my friend

3289155 an estimated 2 725 young people call childline each year because they are the victims of homophobic bullying and violence of these 60 are children between the ages of 12 and 15

3289161 our goal is to free the kodori gorge of georgian troops
3289162 today the assault begins it is a high mountain operation
3289163 we are entering a new stage with about 3 000 troops with artillery aviation and infantry reinforcements
3289164 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3289165 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3289166 be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3289167 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3289168 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3289169 it is not in our traditions to topple anyone or put someone on a throne
3289170 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers they can no longer remain
3289171 they brought shame on themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes and shot at comrades with whom they served in the same peacekeeping unit
3289172 basically fundamentally television was a performers medium and news and current affairs were the sideshow
3289173 one of the reasons that i honestly believe that the care taken on light entertainment had to be the same care as was taken for ballet or opera or serious drama is because you are contributing to the culture of the country i think its sad if it isnt
3289174 its a very sad day to lose him he knew about the business he knew about television
3289175 he was responsible for what i think was the golden age of bbc television which well never have again
3289176 he knew how to treat performers he knew how to talk to them how to get them to do things even if they didnt want to he talked them into it because he knew it would be good for them
3289177 without him i dont think the show would have gone on he undoubtedly had a nose for a hit
3289178 he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us absolutely to the hilt
3289179 he was an entrepreneur and theres not many of his type about any more im afraid we shall miss him terribly i loved him
3289180 he was both a great impresario and also a passionate believer in public service broadcasting
3289181 an error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server
3289182 the georgian government wasnt right if they dont have enough force they shouldnt behave like this
3289183 there was so much blood spilled and for what outcome
3289184 as for now i have no faith in the european union or the united states
3289185 i only have faith in myself georgia and the georgian people georgians have always been alone in the world
3289186 do you think we can depend on americas help of course we cant
3289187 i felt like the bomb fell right on our house

3289198 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3289199 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3289200 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well

3289205 weve been virtualising on the mainframe for 35 years were just talking about bringing that out into all the other environments as well
3289206 its not like theres a silver bullet the issue in implementing virtualisation is doing the end to end architectural thinking around soa

3289280 a laser system emitting at 326 nm could be ideal for manipulating group three atoms such as indium in say researchers from the university of bonn in germany the source looks particularly promising for atomic nanofabrication anf an application involving the precise handling and direct deposition of atoms using laser light we are experimenting with a laser cooled in atomic beam
3289281 the goal of our research is to generate a fully 3d structured in al as crystal with periodically modulated in concentration it is conceivable to generate fully 3d nanostructures with anf
3289282 in the short term an indium atomic beam will be laser collimated to enhance the beam flux and reduce the transverse velocity of indium atoms in the beam which is the requirement to generate narrow structures
3289283 in the long term a source of single indium atoms may be constructed to generate structures more accurately on an atom by atom basis

3289455 i knew if i tried my best id win it
3289456 so far this is the highlight but i hope theres more to come
3289457 obviously i felt the pressure but i kept my mind free during the competition
3289458 i always pitch for my family thats why im playing to help support them
3289459 youre tired and youre all those things but to be able to do that a day after having a baby is really special you get a little bit extra when youre in a situation like that
3289460 yeah weve had some struggles the past few games but i believe in our guys and i believe were going to turn it around
3289461 its just a matter of time before someone gets that big hit and it goes the other way
3289462 its something weve got to take care of pretty quick
3289463 we look at leigh as a starter but when we go to a base defense and theres only two corners on the field travis fishers starting at right currently
3289464 if we started the game tomorrow and the offense required three cornerbacks leigh bodden would start the game
3289465 ive just got to do what ive got to do
3289466 if i make plays what happens happens i know im a starter in this league
3289467 its definitely a pride thing but its not my decision i cant worry about what i cant control i just have to do it on the field
3289468 our starting positions arent written in sharpie theyre written in pencil
3289469 we have four really good corners right now in this league you cant have enough good corners
3289470 when youve got someone nipping at a starters heels that competition can be a great motivator
3289471 we go a long way if we can eliminate the big plays
3289472 i dont get too many chances to start stuck behind first round picks at middle linebacker since ive been here
3289473 but i believe in myself and im pretty sure the organization believes in me they put me out there and gave me a start and every time i get out there on the field i think i play well and try to show what i can do and show i can be a starter
3289474 it was kind of crazy to see a team like new england who everybody views as the gurus of scouting who do such a great job of bringing in late round picks and free agents and turning them into superstars come calling
3289475 but its weird playing special teams here for three years and being told indirectly thats your role on this team then having a team say hey weve seen your preseason film of you starting
3289476 we kind of joked about that we have 11 linebackers and theyll probably draft a linebacker in the first three rounds and sure enough they did
3289477 you cant fault the panthers for that hes a great value pick and hes a great linebacker too its competition it makes people better
3289478 hes played a lot of football for us he actually started a game for us a couple of years ago i thought he did well operating in there in beasons absence
3289479 in order for us to be a good football team he has to contribute
3289480 anthony brings a ton of leadership and of course a lot of talent and he can really play
3289481 i just think we have to do a good job of managing him because hes one of those guys who is going to go all out and he doesnt like to tell you when hes hurting
3289482 for what ive been through i think thats one of the reasons i come out here and tried to bust my butt because at the end of the day it could be taken away from you
3289483 peter allen at the loading dock says when you live on the river you learn to deal with it flooding when it comes
3289484 a lot of people returned to tara point because of her
3289485 i was worried about teenage girls i wasnt worried about floods
3289486 i could see what was happening after 93 and it made me want to move here
3289487 i got an e mail from a guy who asked if i had any availabilities for saturday aug 9
3289488 and then he asked if we were even up and running yet
3289489 im not concerned with giving any job to a rookie if weve seen enough like we did with
3289490 its the moment of truth where you make the decision
3289491 at some point and im not talking about taylor these nfl kickers started somewhere
3289492 when we brought him in last year he came in in a tough situation and did a good job
3289493 ive been blessed with a strong leg and ive been known as a strong kicker
3289494 i feel like i can get in there and have some speed and make a play if i need to
3289495 for the most part for the rest of my career im sure ill be competing with guys younger than me but thats fine
3289496 i feel better now than i have in the past few years i worked out hard in the offseason so i feel really good

3289505 from a policy perspective the question becomes do you want to keep these towns active
3289506 if you see an out migration driven by accelerating economic decline which is possible then what you may be having is people staying in these areas just because they dont want to leave and having to piece together work
3289507 at the last three home football games last year there were over 1 000 people
3289508 i havent run into the guys with the bags on their heads
3289509 maybe theyre still out there but i couldnt see them i didnt know who they were
3289510 thats a good feeling to be back and being in a situation where we can have a good team and go out eventually whenever that is on a good note
3289511 hes always talking always encouraging us always coaching us all at once
3289512 youd never know he was 61 its unbelievable how much energy he has
3289513 i just needed to be reminded how good he is as a coach and certainly as a position coach
3289514 in the meeting rooms hes just outstanding hes going to make a big impact
3289515 i dont know that bitter is the term anytime you try to do something and it doesnt work out its disappointing
3289516 i was disappointed for a lot of reasons but the bottom line is its business
3289517 im a cowboy when youre somewhere for 14 years youre a company man
3289518 the reason i got into coaching was because i like being around the players
3289519 sometimes the coordinator and the head coach is more of a manager than he is a teacher so i am very comfortable what im doing im happy
3289520 la edad me daba miedo pero no fue un problema
3289521 nuestra idea como la de casi todos era acoger a un beb

3289526 we expect to have over 85 000 in the stadium
3289527 there is a concern over darius who may have done some damage to his knee which is a real disappointment
3289528 he has done exceptionally well in pre season and will be assessed further during the week
3289529 our aim was to integrate tal as quickly as possible and that is what we have done
3289530 i thought he was excellent against milan and showed good movement good anticipation of situations that he nipped in the bud and when we switched him to left back he was looking to be aggressive and affect the game in a positive way
3289531 he showed off the quality that we know he has hes ambitious and determined and were delighted to have him here
3289532 hes got the versatility and flexibility to play in a number of positions he showed that against milan and hes going to be a big asset for us
3289533 added to that he has settled in well and the great thing is that he is a talker who tries to organise things for us and that will be a bonus you cannot have enough of that in the side
3289534 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it why is ebay any different from that analogy
3289535 the headlines should be about marco as he had another great game
3289536 as long as we can keep all our players we can do well in this league
3289537 when you look at the population and the uut revenue they do grow at consistent rates with one another
3289538 there were no huge increases no decreases revenues that we received from iid were in line with the growth from the city
3289539 tell that godamn fucking cunt to not ever fucking hang up on me
3289540 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3289541 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3289542 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
3289543 if there were some terrible scandal in obamas past hillarys people would have found it

3289545 there was a little incident but it is an olympic games you are in a different world and people are going to do things differently
3289546 he had a pop at me before the last dive i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do
3289547 thats just thomas hes over nervous thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform
3289548 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens
3289549 certainly not so much for me im a little bit older than tom so i can take things on the chin a bit easier
3289550 if you are a member of a private health insurance fund as a direct result of this rudd government policy its been confirmed today youll be paying significantly higher insurance premiums next year
3289551 its an mp3 you have to protect it or theyll copy it

3289594 get in the f king car now i aint getting a ticket for no one
3289595 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3289596 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it

3289619 hes not coming back any time in the foreseeable future
3289620 i think he was hurt by the courts verdict against his wife
3289621 there is some defiance in his dramatic handwritten note when you see leaders like this they live in the public imagination when you take them out of the country
3289622 the government will have the chance to show they are not thaksins proxy
3289623 the political direction in thailand will become clearer investors will feel reassured about thai politics

3289640 ghana tours does not own aircrafts to operate charter but rather enters into agreements with aircraft owners to engage in charter operations so if an aircraft owner is no longer interested in doing business with ghana tours this cannot be the reason to fold up ghana tours entirely
3289641 ghana tours folded up due to deceit dishonesty cheating manipution and bad business practices on the part of anthony ogunseitan who is the head of planning
3289642 a greedy and a smart schemer who smartly dissolved ghana tours to escape being caught up by the law
3289643 however mr ogunseitan continued to mislead ghanaians that everything was alright as far as ghana tours is concerned only to use flight cancellation by air namibia and minor clarifications with uk authorities as cause to close down a company
3289644 ten dead bodies and 11 injured have been brought here

3289658 the original plan was for us to get married when i get back
3289659 but the more i learned about it the resources all the support if anything was to happen to me i didnt want to just leave her out there
3289660 i knew we were young and i didnt want to press the issue
3289661 i said something about it but then i just prayed about it i said when kyle was ready well talk about it again hell bring it up
3289662 you will always be in our thoughts and prayers always
3289663 the loss of any animal here at the zoo will always be difficult
3289664 we can feel comfortable knowing she lived a long healthy life
3289665 this is not to say she didnt feel distress or strong feelings but it didnt represent a new psychiatric disorder
3289666 it is a continuation of her pattern of having anxiety depression reactions to significant stressors
3289667 it is better for vodafone to come in even if they are going to retrench workers that exercise will not affect all the 4 200 workers it is better to have a few workers go than allow the entire entity to collapse
3289668 vodafone as a giant in the telecom sector will resuscitate the dying gt
3289669 let us go with the big players vodafone the preferred choice
3289670 i peeped through a window but saw no sign of an intruder so i returned to my task but no sooner had i settled down than the barking of the dogs resumed with greater ferocity again i went and peeped through a window but there was no sign of anyone outside
3289671 we tried to escape from our residence through another door but the robbers started firing through the door and the bullets narrowly missed us so we ran back into the house
3289672 the wide spread violence and brutalities that characterised the registration exercise at some centres provide a serious cause for concern the brutalities visited on some party agents were just unfortunate and i think all of us have learnt good lessons from the experience it is indeed a wake up call for all of us
3289673 you see if you have a situation where an honourable member of parliament could go to the extent of making such a highly irresponsible statement then we should all know that we have a long way to go
3289674 there is a convoy leaving from the american embassy wednesday at 1 oclock
3289675 they are not fighting they are just trying to occupy georgia city by city the russians will come into power the russians will put in their own parliament the other concern is that there will be a curfew where we could not leave we are hoping to get to the bus provided by the embassy
3289676 the mood is we are staying hopeful the overall idea is that russia will occupy the country after that they will go for azerbaijan ukraine its all big politics overall there is fear like in the early 90s when the country was without food electricity and water my parents hope that it wont be like that people are nervous they are buying piles of food
3289677 not yet but they are in other cities in a couple of days perhaps there is nobody in the streets people are not chaotic there are a few peaceful demonstrations in front of the russian embassy but there is no screaming no yelling
3289678 the final point here we think that the russians just want to occupy the entire country not just ossetia georgia is a door to oil supplies to energy it is horrible i am getting out because i have an american husband and i have a child if i didnt have a child i wouldnt leave
3289679 that russia can do something without acknowledging international diplomatic rules georgian president saakashvili was brave at the beginning hoping that the united states would step in and help them to defend their territory when it came down to reality nobody is going to fight against russia it would be world war iii
3289680 people are disappointed everybody wants to have georgia as a significant partner but nobody steps in to help the population thinks the west and the united states they can talk offer condolences but nobody takes action next azerbaijan next ukraine
3289681 were hoping that the victim will be able to provide us with a statement
3289682 there are crimes that describe what may have happened but were still putting the pieces of the puzzle together
3289683 the man was lying on the floor and was a food source for the puppies
3289684 that is the safest and fastest way to restore the ph to meet the permit requirement and to meet the water quality expectations
3289685 we are beginning tomorrow to do the removal of miscellaneous equipment we found at the bottom of the lake
3289686 some of those who recognized their bicycle after the water cleared up have taken their bicycles from the bottom of the lake the car will be removed tomorrow we are hopeful
3289687 i talked this morning with the goose patrol which is managed by a group of dogs
3289688 we obviously want to get a handle on that soon
3289689 every day i enjoyed coming to work at wsh it is an exceptional hospital with exceptional staff wsh is highest level in the quality of treatment offered to patients now is an opportunity for a new director to continue to move the hospital forward
3289690 i was a little surprised we heard about this on friday
3289691 its unfortunate and frustrating snakebittens probably the best phrase you could use
3289692 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3289693 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3289694 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3289695 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3289696 i just went up there wanting to put the ball in play
3289697 i made good contact and the ball just took off you dont go up there looking for home runs but when they help the team win its a good feeling
3289698 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3289699 a few of these guys are going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3289700 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3289701 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3289702 its up to them right now if they dont call down to the bullpen they dont call down but im ready
3289703 hes just now getting back to where he should be really
3289704 that hes sore every now and then goes back to the fact that he threw 120 pitches and hes only used to throwing around 30
3289705 before the all star game it was feeling a little maybe like i had a tiny bit of tendinitis in there not bad if i would have just thrown regular at the all star game it probably would have gone away because i had the other three days off over the break but that didnt allow it to recover
3289706 we extended a little bit more than what we anticipated but after observing him down in the bullpen today it was well worth it
3289707 its better every time we see him theres a huge ceiling for him the father has been a professional player and theres a lot of good things there
3289708 we extended a little bit more than what we anticipated
3289709 but after observing him down in the bullpen today it was well worth it
3289710 i was unsure about signing and the money wasnt there
3289711 cole gave me a call and we talked about it
3289712 i guess he sent his son over here for me to mess up
3289713 i felt strong so its up to them right now im going to be ready to throw if they dont call down they dont call down but im ready
3289714 put it this way before the all star game it was feeling a little maybe like i had a tiny bit of tendinitis in there not bad
3289715 if i would have just thrown regular at the all star game it probably would have gone away because i had the other 3 days off over the break but that didnt allow it to recover it didnt help it at all i dont want to say the all star game caused it to be bad but obviously it didnt help it
3289716 hes one of the easiest guys ive ever known to get along with
3289717 nba commissioner david stern has told those associated with the cubs that cuban is one of the nbas best partners
3289718 and everyone appreciates that cuban understands fans and marketing and is one of the creative pioneers of the world of new media and would create a tremendous buzz throughout baseball that would be nothing but beneficial to the industry
3289719 so he might yell at umpire joe west george steinbrenner did a lot worse to umpires and what steinbrenner did for baseball because of how he grew the yankees will put him in cooperstown and put a lot of money in other owners pockets
3289720 over the past year the negative impact of equities on scheme assets combined with falling bond yields have led to an overall worsening of the funding position
3289721 with lower bond yields resulting in a 8 6 percent increase in aggregate liabilities while weaker equities shares have reduced assets by 7 4 percent

3289723 when the news about changing local online politics broke yesterday stocks bumped up a bit
3289724 market conditions are obviously challenging and have adversely affected the ca
3289725 generally revpar growth slowed through the second quarter and mark
3289726 they have all been telling me what a huge achievement winning gold is
3289727 i realise that but frankly the enormity of the goodwill generated has caught me by surprise
3289728 honestly enough it really has not changed me i am still the same abhinav who just a day ago was hanging around alone in my room in the olympic village
3289729 i might say that at the back of my head i still want to play but the reality is that i cannot play for now and i have to accept that i need to look at another direction because there is no reason to think about a comeback
3289730 i have been forced into early retirement this is a big blow mentally because i have to switch off from football now
3289731 i might not want to accept it but the reality is that i will never play again because of this it really doesnt help much to be forcing thoughts of playing again
3289732 i am unfortunate that i am injured and out of contract so football is out of my mind
3289733 maybe this is a calling for me to venture into something else but i will not be completely lost to the game i have to admit that my future in football is bleak so i consider myself retired i have been forced to hang my boots and i think the next time i play football will be on a social level with my friends and not professional

3289771 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3289772 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3289773 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3289774 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3289775 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3289776 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3289787 coal is the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel there is
3289788 rbs is providing the financial means for companies to build unabated coal fired power stations and dig new coal mines all over the world yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result
3289789 people are coming from all over the country to protest against the proposed new coal fired power station at kingsnorth if rbs and the other banks dont stop financing such climate trashing projects they risk a similar public backlash
3289790 most significant impact on climate change is the investment and lending decisions we make
3289791 banks have a duty to give the public a full disclosure about fossil fuel financing so that account holders can choose whether they want their money to be used to support new coal projects like kingsnorth power station

3289805 che cosa ha fatto di male quella donna per essere messa in una cella
3289806 e una indesiderata unemarginata una donna che forse vittima di una tratta e che cerca di vivere o sopravvivere con il proprio corpo e questo in una italia sempre pi intollerante diventata una colpa
3289807 essere poveri sta diventando un crimine e in questa fascia di nuovi perseguitati i pi deboli sono gli immigrati e le donne ci sono troppe lucciole che sono schiave e si vendono sui marciapiedi perch minacciate da chi le ha fatte arrivare in italia
3289808 le retate anti prostituzione continua servono solo a fare impazzire le lucciole che scappano da una citt allaltra o da un quartiere allaltro in cerca di un clima pi tollerante la ragazza fotografata chieder mai aiuto a chi lha trattenuta in quella cella si fider mai delle forze dellordine anche se vittima della tratta non glielo dir e se insieme alle sue colleghe sar cacciata in un cono dombra ancora maggiore ad esempio se sar costretta a prostituirsi in un appartamento non incontrer neppure volontari in grado di spiegargli che pu entrare in un percorso di protezione i sindaci sceriffo stanno cavalcando il tema della prostituzione ottenendo come unico effetto quello di criminalizzare chi avrebbe bisogno di protezione
3289809 trovo vergognoso continua corso riferendosi alla foto quel corpo abbandonato a terra in un comando di polizia municipale trovo vergognoso che i nostri poliziotti carabinieri e vigili urbani controllino gli immigrati senza informarli dei loro diritti e che si scambi la prostituzione per un problema di sicurezza
3289810 siamo scettici nei confronti delle ordinanze dei sindaci nati sulla scia della carta di parma e delle retate anti prostituzione le forze dellordine dovrebbero essere inviate in strada non a fare multe ma a capire i meccanismi che soggiacciono a certi fenomeni dovrebbero essere preparati per leggere i segnali capire se di fronte hanno donne vittime dello sfruttamento o meno sarebbe necessario guardare in faccia la realt e trovare soluzioni pragmatiche ad esempio zone in cui la prostituzione possa avvenire alla luce del sole invece di alimentare o cavalcare politicamente la percezione dinsicurezza dei cittadini

3289821 s tenemos publicidad en los sitios de venta pero creemos en la autorregulaci n porque no queremos que los menores de edad fumen y tenemos una campa a de no venta a menores as como la campa a de los espacios de fumadores y no fumadores
3289822 creemos que la nueva ley que se quiere aprobar no es razonable porque el cigarrillo es un producto legal que debe ser regulado sabemos que es un producto de riesgo como los hay muchos y creemos que un consumidor mayor de edad informado decide si fuma o no

3289936 in the past year 14 rape victims 1 of rape related applications were told they would get less money because of alcohol consumption the cica confirmed
3289937 in a second statement issued later the cica said a mistake had been made in helens case and its policy was not to reduce awards to rape victims on the basis of alcohol consumption
3289938 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption it is never an individuals fault if he she gets raped regardless of how much he she has drunk

3289962 i need to take a few days off and spend time with my family i love being part of sports and i guess its difficult to stay away i really cannot bid goodbye to shooting but i seriously need time to think whether i would compete ever
3289963 you have to see the whole thing as a four year journey it was not easy to continue after athens for i had some personal issues but i thank my coaches who stood by me and made me believe i could continue
3289964 last 10 days we were trying to read the targets and i had some difficulty today that also explains the relative low scores in the field today
3289965 when we shoot the first shot the bird is not actually there we only expect it there its anticipation and much like a catch in cricket where you stretch your arm to intercept the ball little hesitation and you are doomed
3289966 i had trouble reading the first target and it affected anticipation as well
3289967 im upset that i could not hold on to my scores i did not shoot very high this year but that should have been enough to qualify for the finals here at the end i have not been able to achieve what we came here for

3289970 its expected that the task team will report to the icc and participating countries soon after which csa will discuss the matter further
3289971 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3289972 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3289973 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3289974 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3289975 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3289976 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3289977 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3289978 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

3289984 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3289985 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3289986 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3289987 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3289988 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3289991 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3289992 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3289993 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3289994 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3289995 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3289996 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3289997 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3289998 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3289999 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
