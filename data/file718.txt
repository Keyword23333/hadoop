7180004 georgia is an ancient country at the crossroads of eastern europe and central asia and one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion after a brief period of independence following the russian revolution the red army forced georgia to join the soviet union in 1922 as the soviet union crumbled at the end of the cold war georgia regained its independence in 1991 but its early years were marked by instability corruption and economic crises

7180006 wheres someone in a hurry going to get basic information on the republic of georgia
7180007 two paragraphs about an eighth of the full speech contain material directly copied from wikipedia or superficially modified from its text those two paragraphs constitute the entire factual background of the speech though the rest is reaction and proposed policy
7180008 we did not copy wikipedia in sen mccains remarks there are only so many ways to state basic historical facts and dates and that any similarities to wikipedia were only coincidental
7180009 im only aware of this situation through media coverage ive seen nor do we or i have any in depth detail about the situation
7180010 i would say its a good practice to attribute text or content whenever possible obviously when its a matter of copyright then there are legal considerations but the foundation is not able to examine individual cases

7180047 dont you worry we support boeing no matter what awful thing they allegedly have done or not done
7180048 agreed to a higher price for the aircraft than she believed was appropriate
7180049 that the government alleged that boeing double billed for materials used in modernizing kc 135 stratotankers and rc 135 reconnaissance aircraft materials double billed included nuts bolts rivets and fasteners
7180050 that boeing charged for the materials even though those costs were included in the companys contract with the government
7180051 thank you for sharing your thoughts regarding the air force tanker selection process it was good to hear from you and i welcome the opportunity to respond the united states air force is currently looking to purchase a new line of refueling tankers they have come up with a list of 26 requirements that must be met by companies such as boeing in order to receive a contract in 2004 the house armed services committee voted unanimously to require the air force to enter into a multi year contract for new tankers the current line of tankers includes planes that are 40 years old some of which are corroding and the air force now has an urgent need to replace these planes the department of defense is currently considering all options for this contract to ensure that they get the best planes for the taxpayers dollars i believe that boeing is the company that can provide the air force with the best possible planes for the taxpayers money and i am hopeful that congress will work to continue a strong relationship with boeing boeing has a proven track record of providing high quality refueling tankers for the us air force please know that i will continue to support boeing and jobs in the pacific northwest boeings everett plant provides hundreds of jobs for washington families the impact that this contract could have on the economy of our region and the lives of thousands of washingtonians is very significant please know that i will continue to fight on behalf of washington families by advocating that this contract be awarded to boeing once again thank you for taking the time to get in touch with me your interest and input are valued and i hope to hear from you in the future regarding other matters of importance i encourage you to visit my website and sign up for my weekly e newsletter at th congressional district and our nation
7180052 im not sure i cant even tell if shes breathing
7180053 she might be the prototype of what well all be like in fifty years
7180054 your right i shouldnt but she shouldnt be delivering pizzas cold she and i are alike in a certain way i if she is okay with sleeping on the job then giving her a two dollar tip and mocking her is something we mutually should be okay with
7180055 okay i know there is no reason why you did that but before i proceed to kick your ass ill ask if there is
7180056 hello james to brain can you hear me has a connection been severed give me a vocal response as a sign that you are fine
7180057 this is brain to james all connections are in working order i must apologize for activating the knee jabbing mechanism

7180071 evolution has been the focus of a lot of debate in our state this year
7180072 if you read the newspapers everyone is arguing is it a theory is it not a theory the answer is we can observe it we can see it happen just like you can see it in mickey
7180073 i can see that theres no way i came from an ape
7180074 is this really what they want us to teach for the next 10 years
7180075 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man
7180076 we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird
7180077 we also failed to include astrology alchemy and the concept of the moon being made of green cheese
7180078 i can do this until the end of the semester and i can only assume that it will work the same way each time
7180079 bryce what is it called when natural laws are suspended what do you call it when water changes into wine
7180080 it cant tell you whats right and wrong it doesnt address ethics but it is not anti religion science and religion just ask different questions
7180081 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7180082 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7180083 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7180084 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7180085 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
7180086 i still dont have a good feeling on how well any of them are internalizing any of this
7180087 its maybe the size of a dogs jaw or a cats
7180088 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
7180089 thats why people stand strong with christianity because it teaches people to lead a good life and not do wrong
7180090 ill watch the discovery channel and say ooh thats interesting
7180091 but theres a difference between thinking something is interesting and believing it
7180092 homo sapiens appeared in africa 200 000 years ago based on fossil and dna evidence
7180093 the fossil evidence of hominids alleged human ancestors is extremely limited
7180094 but theirs is a longer hand because they live in trees and their arms are very long
7180095 but this is happening over millions of years with humans if im lucky i might see four generations in my lifetime
7180096 then whatever we evolved from where did it evolve from
7180097 how does our hand go from being that long to just a smaller hand
7180098 individuals with small hands will have more children while those with bigger hands will disappear
7180099 but if we came from them why are they still around
7180100 just because a new population evolves doesnt mean the old one dies out

7180107 assure us that deterrence will work but when the time comes to deter youre against it
7180108 are willing to do whatever it takes to defend the american public from terrorists as long as the french and germans say its ok
7180109 over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change and our favorite seaside destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots
7180110 i think we have a natural affinity with our coast and the sea but we all need to be aware that our environment is not fixed and that change is inevitable
7180111 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7180112 but they are very skilled at obtaining money and using criminal systems to do it they can collect thousands and thousands of dollars or euros in a few weeks it is beyond our control
7180113 the united states and its allies have been winning the war on the financial front
7180114 it got the entire financial bureaucracy started on a wild goose chase
7180115 theres a complete disconnect between this approach and the underlying reality of how terrorism is funded
7180116 clearly when youre dealing with groups that are self funded youre dealing with a different set of circumstances from when they put these laws in place
7180117 the bad guys after a while they realize what were doing so theyre going to alter how they do business
7180118 obviously youre not going to stop them from getting money and theyre going to be able to adapt
7180119 i couldnt believe it when they told me that this might have been connected to terrorism
7180120 thats the cleverness of these schemes to keep it under the radar
7180121 by doing this they can raise significant amounts of money fairly quickly and theres no real way to detect it
7180122 if fanaticism is the heart of modern terrorism then finance is its lifeblood
7180123 there will be no hiding place for those who finance terrorism
7180124 we will take any necessary steps and find all necessary resources to ensure whether in iraq afghanistan or anywhere else there is no safe haven for terrorists and no hiding place for terrorist finance
7180125 i think there is a realization that they are not that effective
7180126 but they need to be seen as doing something to provide reassurance to the public that theyre doing something were living in a false paradise if you think these things will stop it
7180127 we mustnt be wooed into the idea that because attacks are costing less and less that there isnt a need for money or that it isnt being provided
7180128 its not just the money they need to make the explosive devices its the money they need for other things to support the network to recruit and to train
7180129 notwithstanding the successes weve had groups associated or affiliated with al qaeda still appear to be able to carry out an attack as and when they feel so inclined
7180130 either they had the money already when they needed it or they have no problem getting it
7180131 youre looking for a needle in a haystack and unfortunately you have a field full of haystacks
7180132 what the governor said in our meeting was very good
7180133 he quoted the koran very correctly but i am not sure how much power he has now i am going home and the taliban control my district not him
7180134 a court case in the government system takes five years and many bribes the taliban will settle it in an afternoon
7180135 they said they were responsible for every chicken hotak said people believe them when they kill a robber everyone is happy
7180136 when the taliban were in power you could drive all the way to kandahar afghanistans second city 250 miles away with a bag of money and no one would touch you
7180137 now the government are thieves since 2001 nothing has changed except security is worse
7180138 the police know that if they stay in their station and do nothing the taliban leave them alone and only launch attacks in the next district
7180139 the taliban told them that they had no need of such people just religious scholars
7180140 back in 2002 everyone was scared of the coalition forces and hopeful for change
7180141 the taliban kept a low profile many fled to pakistan
7180142 there are the old taliban and the clerics and then there are now the young guys they are angry poor violent teenagers they are easy to recruit
7180143 wardak has an undeservedly bad reputation due to media exaggeration
7180144 i have hundreds of development projects banking investment parks and clinics being built wardak is a good news story but resources are scarce and demands are enormous
7180145 we sent a deputation to the taliban leadership in pakistan asking them why they were so focused on wardak
7180146 we told them that capturing maidan shah would just cause them problems they did not respond

7180148 at this point the ball is with council staff to develop a proposal that will come back to council over the next few months but it could involve stickers badges posters and t shirts similar to the safe place pink triangle campaign
7180149 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7180150 its a gimmick a token effort to do with a very serious problem
7180151 its essentially signs and stickers what we need is more police and if they dont have the resources council should provide money to employ security guards
7180152 more education in anything doesnt go astray but we need both awareness and more police
7180153 we need more police presence and safety measures not just putting a label on it

7180171 every one of my employees knows every other employees salary from the receptionist right up to the software engineers
7180172 the way we were raised is that it was bad taste to talk about how much you make

7180190 beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular it reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and we fear further tighten its grip at home
7180191 it pocketed these gains without offering any concessions in return
7180192 only one national flag was raised to the ceiling it was red with five stars this is almost miraculous a perfect ending to the 2008 beijing olympics
7180193 obviously i think that china can be very proud of what theyve done for these games
7180194 we have seen what the chinese have done and im sure well better them without a doubt
7180195 there was obviously a lot of negativity leading up to the competition but everyone knew that once the games actually started that would disappear and the success of the teams and the athletes would take over
7180196 value becomes the cognitive and immaterial product of creative action

7180207 strike action is a last resort for our members who provide an invaluable service in ensuring the safety of shipping in british waters
7180208 the latest action could have been avoided if the government and the maritime and coastguard agency mca hadnt continued with their refusal to negotiate a satisfactory outcome
7180209 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation
7180210 but if you look in front of you you tend not to hit stuff i was trying to be smart and cautious but it didnt do me any good
7180211 we were just blocked in behind a bunch of cars and then a bunch of cars in front of me started wrecking
7180212 i like my spotter hes a good guy but man thats ridiculous
7180213 we just took out a bunch of cars for no reason and ourselves im pretty upset about it
7180214 to me what makes this sport what it is is the fans avidness whether its for or against
7180215 its that theyre so interested in whats going on that they know all they know about the teams the drivers the races and they form an opinion thats the key getting people involved with their opinions whether we like them or not
7180216 you know its just part of the expectations that are on this team
7180217 weve been at a very high end of competition and in the limelight a lot of the years thats a good thing to win four championships and 81 wins all those things those are fantastic
7180218 he sells the stuff on craigslist or ebay he gets rid of it quick

7180221 there are plenty of wonderful streams throughout the state but more often than not theyre not easy to find or not suitable for easy access
7180222 experienced canoers may get used to the difficulties in getting to the water but less experienced people may find it frustrating
7180223 we dont want to make it too easy we want access to be rustic and natural but we dont want people to fall down the hill getting on the water
7180224 recent analysis of wood duck harvest rates and populations by fish and wildlife suggest wood ducks can tolerate more hunting pressure than currently exists
7180225 the breeding population estimate for scaup was 27 percent below the long term average
7180226 fish and wildlife is seeking a 25 percent reduction in the scaup harvest to maintain the diving duck hunting tradition on important scaup harvest areas such as lake erie we were allowed to implement a hybrid scaup season composed of a two bird bag for 20 consecutive days during the 60 day duck season

7180228 most people dont even know we have a state treasurer you run for this position because you feel you can do something for the people of this commonwealth
7180229 im not one of these business leaders who never tasted economic insecurity i have a sense of what that can look and feel like and thats helping to shape this race for me
7180230 we can do this very efficiently and at the same time we can help to ensure that pensioners are not hurt by anti terrorism investment policies
7180231 im very much someone who believes we are all somewhat social investors no one wants to invest in companies with bad practices
7180232 when you really look at the treasurers office its really important
7180233 is basically the chief financial officer for the state of pennsylvania with a multi billion dollar budget annually that has to be managed
7180234 in a state as large as pennsylvania with a budget as large as pennsylvanias over 28 billion having someone whos qualified and capable in that office is important
7180235 i think for most treasurers the odds are with them running again but im not someone who needs to hold public office thats not what ive organized my life around
7180236 i think you go serve your time in government and then go back to the private world
7180237 id like to do eight years as treasurer and go back and practice law some more
7180238 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7180239 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7180240 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7180241 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7180242 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7180243 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7180244 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7180245 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7180246 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7180247 change we need after eight years of failed policies that favored special interests at the expense of our families under george bush and john mccain
7180248 joe biden is the genuine article who has brought change to washington without being changed by washington
7180249 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else

7180253 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7180254 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7180255 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7180256 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7180257 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7180258 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7180259 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7180260 if i was to get a family plan for medical where i work were looking at almost 800 a month i spend that much on after school care for my daughters
7180261 so we just decided that except for the medical issues i had we could probably get by for three or four months without worrying too much
7180262 will do everything in their power and spend millions of dollars to lobby against it
7180263 unless he does what he talks about in uniting the masses of public opinion and creating social change somehow to get the american people to say im tired of it and im not going to take it anymore

7180283 the department of national defence and the department of fisheries and oceans are currently considering the next steps
7180284 the conservatives claim that theyve fixed the chaotic procurement system this is evidence that they have not its simply irresponsible to tender an important contract like this knowing that no bidder can possibly meet the terms of the contract
7180285 harper and the conservatives have money for the war in afghanistan but when it comes to life saving coastguard vessels the conservatives just dont share the priorities of canadians and their families
7180286 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7180287 in case the fire is effective or the security of a defended locality is threatened you may find that even indian troops may retaliate but nothing of any serious nature itll be kind of a controlled retaliation in response to any action by them but nothing beyond that
7180288 the pakistani army would not like to escalate the situation because all their reserves are committed at the moment in fighting violence and terrorism within pakistan and on the western borders
7180289 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7180290 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7180291 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7180292 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7180293 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7180294 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7180295 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7180296 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7180297 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7180298 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7180299 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7180300 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7180301 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7180302 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7180303 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7180304 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7180305 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7180306 the speaking fee for musharraf would be in the 150 000 200 000 range for a day
7180307 plus jet and other v i p arrangements on the ground
7180308 if we did multiple events in multiple cities musharraf could get closer to the 500 000 to 1 000 000 range for a series of talks

7180314 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7180315 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race

7180322 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7180323 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7180324 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7180325 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7180326 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7180327 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7180328 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7180329 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7180330 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7180331 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7180332 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
7180333 whether its ceilings caving in or every little thing that needs to be repaired in their apartments it seems like they get the runaround whenever they call for service
7180334 one of my neighbors his ceiling has caved in and he is waiting for someone to come and make repairs
7180335 yet there are men working all throughout this building renovating the halls and renovating empty apartments

7180345 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel

7180349 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
7180350 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
7180351 i strongly advise the public especially those at risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
7180352 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
7180353 these abstinence only interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
7180354 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
7180355 raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior

7180364 texaco was a great sponsor for a long time but for the last year they really have been disconnected with the sport
7180365 they have focused on other things we really didnt get much support from them the money wasnt all that great
7180366 for us it was a blessing that we can go out and find somebody who can pay us some real money
7180367 texaco was a liability for us because out of loyalty to them we werent aggressively looking to replace them
7180368 we kept hoping they maybe would wake up one of these days and decide they need to be in nascar the company i feel bad for them they only made 6 billion last quarter
7180369 the texaco management is disconnected from racing all the new people dont know what a race car looks like

7180373 adrians a safety who runs like a corner and hits like a linebacker he can do it all at any given time we can switch responsibilities and not miss a beat
7180374 what we found out last year is that antrel has a very good feel for the ball
7180375 he has very good ball skills and range now we can do some things with antrel and adrian that will make them more interchangeable as antrel grows into the safety role
7180376 my heel was bothering me for the past four five years
7180377 i got to the point where i couldnt really walk
7180378 im going into this season motivated to prove again who adrian wilson is as a football player ive always said im the best safety in the nfc
7180379 ive never really said i publicly wanted a new deal
7180380 ill let my agent eugene parker be that bad guy
7180381 i think we have a lot of guys with something to prove but we have to put contract issues aside this year is all about winning
7180382 considering the circumstances the boks were in they were quite desperate after last week this is a significant win
7180383 weve had a tough time of it in the last few years not winning here since 2000 and the fact its always difficult so were very satisfied
7180384 were simply not hanging on to the ball for more than three phases
7180385 if we can keep the ball then we can turn it around its very disappointing but theres no time to waste we have to go back and work on the mistakes were making on the field
7180386 i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7180387 and he has before they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7180388 its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now you know to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners and chatter his tires is what he did
7180389 thats what happened its too bad we tore up the car a little bit after the race but i guess he wasnt happy about it and i can understand
7180390 i dont know what happened in front of me two cars got together
7180391 i was getting into the corner and the car behind me just didnt see it and ran over me
7180392 we had a good race car and its a shame we got caught up in that mess

7180410 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7180411 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7180412 shes always supported us comes in on a regular basis
7180413 we needed her support in helping us with a liquor license to getting the city to actually recognize we were coming in
7180414 she didnt know me and twyla she took us under her wing and looked at us as someone she wanted to groom and nurture
7180415 from a young entrepreneur standpoint i admire everything she did and im going to try my damndest to walk in that light
7180416 its a real question whether the state should be on the hook for that large an expenditure for someone who is going to be in office for such a short period of time

7180418 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7180419 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7180420 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7180421 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small

7180430 to offer consumers more choice and flexibility in how they purchase channels
7180431 the inescapable logic is that by 2011 satellite radio subscribers will face monopoly price hikes by a company with the incentive and ability to impose them
7180432 i dont think there will be any downside for consumers
7180433 consumers who may have been interested in the prospect of satellite radio but were put off with the lack of alternative pricing plans
7180434 the satellite radio industry has a history of promising things and then letting it go by the wayside
7180435 its a classic strategy of balancing the ticket picking a running mate who is strong where youre not strong
7180436 people who were probably leaning toward obama but were a little nervous this makes them more comfortable
7180437 but the people who were skeptical about obama or uncertain i dont think thats enough to budge them off where they are
7180438 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and

7180447 this is outstanding we didnt even think about getting a gold medal we were thinking third place that was our goal every game we gave not 100 percent but 200 percent
7180448 even in the ninth inning we were still ahead we believe in our pitchers our infielders and our outfielders
7180449 weve had good luck all tournament we had good luck tonight
7180450 we came looking for the gold so were not totally satisfied but we played with dignity and our heart thats why were still a little satisfied

7180479 gentile masonry blindly serves as a screen for us and our objects but the plan of action of our force even its very abiding place remains for the whole people an unknown mystery who and what is in a position to overthrow an invisible force
7180480 we shall create and multiply free masonic lodges absorb into them all who may become or who are prominent in public activity for in these lodges we shall find our principle intelligence office and means of influence the most secret political plots will be known to us and will fall under our guiding hands we know the final goal whereas the goyim have knowledge of nothing
7180481 i want all of us to play together as a team whether we win or lose
7180482 we could maybe have one or two losses going into the final game
7180483 im just ready to get on the field and play
7180484 the hardest thing for us to is go on the road
7180485 they had to mature really fast the nervousness is going to go away pretty soon
7180486 i kind of keep everybody in check so we can play better
7180487 y uno de los puntos peak de la noche fue el video cameo que realiza
7180488 este pa s no necesita un h roe de guerra necesita a un l der sabio
7180489 le conozco desde hace 35 a os y aunque le considero mi a migo puedo decir que no puede cambiar a este pa s cuando ha respaldado con su voto el 95 de las iniciativas del gobierno de george w bush
7180490 joe biden me ayudar a cambiar la pol tica que se est haciendo ahora mismo en washington
7180491 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
7180492 was accused of plagiarism when he did not credit neil kinnock then leader of the british labor party for much of his stump speech
7180493 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it
7180494 w hy should i be responsible for paying for joe bidens brain aneurysms
7180495 secure supplies of ammunition to frontline troops in conflict zones such as afghanistan
7180496 i am often asked if the olympic village the vast restaurant and housing conglomeration that hosts the worlds top athletes for the duration of the games is the sex fest it is cracked up to be
7180497 my answer is always the same too right it is
7180498 are the principal objects of desire for many female athletes there is something about sporting success that makes a certain type of woman go crazy smiling flirting and sometimes even grabbing at the chaps who have done the business in the pool or on the track an olympic gold medal is not merely a route to fame and fortune it is also a surefire ticket to writhe
7180499 and then there were the female athletes literally thousands of them
7180500 strutting shimmying sashaying and jogging around the village clad in lycra and exposing yard upon yard of shiny toned rippling and unimaginably exotic flesh
7180501 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7180502 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7180503 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7180504 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7180505 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7180506 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7180507 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7180508 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7180509 i guess he busch got into me a little bit edwards said referring to the post race bump
7180510 the steering wheel mustve come out of my hand and i ended up hitting him
7180511 i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i had to ask myself would he do that to me
7180512 and he has before so thats the way it goes i kinda just ran into him thats what happened
7180513 how many rivals do i need said the 23 year old phenom whose multi series dominance has led to him being booed in much the same fashion jeff gordon was during the dominant years of his career
7180514 i think its going to be pretty exciting while being interviewed by the espn broadcast team while the race was under the seventh of its eight caution periods
7180515 he hit me getting into turn one busch said glumly in the post race interview
7180516 well take it that way into the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7180517 i was just running along and heard clear clear clear and went up and there was still someone waltrip there mears said
7180518 i like my spotter he is a good guy but man thats ridiculous we just took out a bunch of cars for no reason
7180519 as the word spread suddenly this wasnt just the mcdonalds child this was the communitys child he was knoxvilles child
7180520 when god blew breath into that boy he blew extra
7180521 you couldnt have met a sweeter kid but he got in trouble sometimes because he wanted to fit in so bad behind closed doors he was like a 3 year old kid always wanting hugs and attention when the doors opened up he wanted to be like a tough guy hed shrug things off but you knew he was hurting inside
7180522 if he wasnt messing with you or making you laugh you knew something was wrong
7180523 it was a family affair taking care of that kid
7180524 i expected to come home thursday and find him sitting on my front porch
7180525 he always thought he was invincible he thought nobody could whip him but he had a big heart and he loved kids if the ice cream truck came through hed send the other kids out with money
7180526 believe it or not hes probably loved more now than he was when he was alive
7180527 it always seemed like nobody really knew him hed come to my house and wed stay up talking until 3 a m you see all these people out here tonight where were they when he was hurting
7180528 he was making attempts to do right i think the crowd here tonight is going to be more attentive to their children the same thing parents around this city want is what parents in lonsdale want this situation isnt their problem this is our problem
7180529 i have been thinking a lot lately about how long our meetings have been lasting
7180530 i dont think we are serving our constituents or ourselves when we continue our meetings until the wee hours of the morning
7180531 if the meeting lasts past 11 p m i would like to leave the meeting
7180532 if 10 of us leave the meeting there will no longer be a quorum and the meeting would have to adjourn
7180533 i dont want to jeopardize the current investigation in any way
7180534 at each step there appears to have been attempts to stall accelerate stop ignore and frustrate every attempt to explore and expose if necessary wrongdoings at this facility
7180535 we feel like this is a museum for the people all the groups in east tennessee
7180536 i think people are so excited about the exhibit opening that they wanted to help out and be a part of it
7180537 people from the mountains were fighting for their lifestyle and to keep humble homes up in the hills
7180538 march over your mountains hang your leaders and lay waste with fire and sword to your home and fields
7180539 this is a story that needs to ring from every mountaintop and valley because this is who we are as a people
7180540 hes like your father or brother or someone you feel like you can trust
7180541 ive never done anything like this before but i was just motivated for him it was just mccain
7180542 its like electricity you cant help but get caught up in it
7180543 its just the most exciting thing the music the people the enthusiasm everybody there for a common cause and its just absolutely an electrifying experience i never get tired of it
7180544 i felt like i saw his stances and felt like he expressed his stance on abortion and when life begins and about terrorism
7180545 there were just several things he seemed to have clear heartfelt answers about it wasnt like he was just reading a script
7180546 i dont think we have anybody else running who had the breadth of experience he has and i think thats what were going to need in the next four years
7180547 coming from somebody who will soon be 68 i think hes a very young 71
7180548 i know a lot of very young 71 year olds theres nothing wrong with being 71 and having age and wisdom
7180549 reagan was a pretty old guy too and look how reagan turned out
7180550 you could have a great president who is young or old it all depends on the character of the person you are voting for the idea of him being old doesnt bother me at all
7180551 mccain is viewed as his own man and i think most people view him that way and admire him for that
7180552 he adheres to the tenets of the republican party but i think hes different in that i think he listens to his conscience and his maker first and then goes from there
7180553 i just believe that obama is an amazing candidate and is really going to bring some great changes to this country some much needed changes
7180554 i believe he has so much integrity and i believe he really does want to do what he says he plans to do
7180555 its very exciting to me because i havent really been politically active before this campaign its all new to me
7180556 i was just part of the crowd more than anything else running around grant park he said
7180557 this is the best time since 1974 to be a democrat
7180558 i think its one of the most important things they couldve done to unite the party
7180559 theres a lot of people who are hurt over the way the campaign was run seemingly trying to push her out before all of the states got to have a primary
7180560 were smart enough to know that we need to put a democrat in the white house
7180561 i wont agree with obama on all positions nor would i have agreed with hillary clinton on all positions
7180562 i think hes in a good position to bring the party together in a unified manner
7180563 and i think he has demonstrated personally that it is his sincere desire to do that
7180564 i think he should articulate that he is ready to lead by showing how he wants to correct the mistakes of the bush administration
7180565 the real problem with walking to the grocery store that distance is how would you carry the groceries home but i see some of my neighbors do this as there are some who walk towards the grocery store and then an hour later ill see them walking back carrying bags

7180586 hasta un ciego con gafas oscuras en una noche tenebrosa
7180587 efectivamente creo que hay grandes necesidades y coincido con los dirigentes de todos los partidos en que esto no puede seguir as pero a mi modo de ver hay dos elementos fundamentales que hay que atender
7180588 no es posible que hacienda le siga arrebatando a pemex la nica empresa de car cter p blico con solvencia que queda en el pa s ya no digo el 80 por ciento de sus utilidades brutas sino hasta el 100 por ciento de stas
7180589 esa diferencia de m s de 105 d lares por barril le es sustra da a pemex te ricamente en un 80 por ciento en la pr ctica en 2007 se fue arriba del 100 por ciento
7180590 c mo suple eso pemex de una manera terriblemente limitada tanto que no est en capacidad de hacer prospecciones para reponer las reservas probadas que tiene todos los ductos absolutamente envejecidos y reventandos a cada rato que no tiene la posibilidad de garantizar su seguridad aunque esto sea obligaci n del ej rcito mexicano que sufre robos que provocan tr gicos accidentes y lo que es peor que desde 1979 no invierte en una nueva refiner a
7180591 todo el mundo sabe y lo saben los t cnicos a trav s de los sat lites que m xico est nadando en petr leo y no s lo en el golfo y en aguas profundas tambi n en tierra y en aguas someras
7180592 andamos bajos en reservas probadas andamos viejos en todo lo que es oleoductos y gasoductos andamos en el desastre completo en petroqu mica y todo esto es deliberado no cabe la menor duda tuve la oportunidad de hablar en morelia con un alto funcionario de pemex cuyo nombre por supuesto no estoy autorizado a mencionar y me dijo todo esto es claramente deliberado y me dijo algo m s grave el director de pemex est totalmente amarrado de manos por aquellos colaboradores directos que se le han impuesto desde la presidencia de la rep blica
7180593 est n despojando a pemex est n estrangulando a pemex y la han obligado a que se endeude hasta las cachas lo de pidiregas es la gran perversi n financiera nos enga an con la verdad pues es registro diferido en el gasto dicho de otro modo hacienda se hace distra da de que la empresa p blica m s importante se siga endeudando obligatoriamente cuando eso deber a ser estrictamente hablando y en t rminos de adecuado manejo financiero deuda p blica
7180594 si a pemex le cobrara hacienda el 50 por ciento de derechos e impuestos le quedar a otro 50 por ciento con lo que tendr a de sobra para reparar sus ductos renovarlos completamente hacer prospecciones necesarias para lograr el 100 por ciento de las reservas probadas y tambi n podr a construir las refiner a que tanta falta nos hacen
7180595 en resumen el verdadero problema de pemex est en la secretar a de hacienda que esquilma a la empresa y peor sabemos que ese esquilmo est yendo a parar en parte a gasto corriente porque casi coincide exactamente con la elusi n fiscal de los 50 consorcios privados m s importantes del pa s
7180596 el dijo durante el periodo 2001 2006 o sea el sexenio de vicente fox pemex aport a la secretar a de hacienda 720 mil millones de pesos 680 mil millones de pesos les fueron devueltos a los 50 consorcios privados m s importantes del pa s
7180597 ahora yo creo que ah hay que dejar una pregunta en el aire si privatizamos pemex cualquier cosa as sea la maquila de la refinaci n se les van a cobrar los mismos impuestos a las empresas que vengan les van a cobrar 115 por ciento de impuestos los van a tratar como tratan a las otras empresas privadas devolvi ndoles dinero
7180598 this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7180599 this is the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history

7180601 it listeria is virtually impossible to eradicate in its entirety
7180602 it exists in plants in supermarkets potentially in your kitchen
7180603 if test results went the other way wed be starting to look again and widening the circle for other products this limits it to what we have been focusing on so it is good news
7180604 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7180605 we are very confident but i cannot give you a percentage but virtually all of it has been removed

7180615 thats something we are going to have to fix we havent played 60 minutes against any team in this league not just one of the top teams
7180616 not only as a blocking back do we miss him but also as a leader out there we lack leadership at times on the field on offence so weve got to get them pumped up and get guys delivering a blow rather than catching a blow

7180721 its economic formulas are simply not suitable for addressing cost effectiveness in this area of medicine
7180722 it is essential that nice gets its sums right we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7180723 we now spend similar amounts to europe on health generally and cancer care in particular but less than two thirds of the european average on cancer drugs
7180724 it just cant be that everybody else around the world is wrong about access to innovative cancer care and the nhs right in rationing it so severely
7180725 the time has come for a radical change in how the nhs makes rationing decisions for cancer
7180726 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs which is determined annually by parliament
7180727 if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis

7180732 its unlikely that we will see another olympics of this scope and stature again
7180733 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
7180734 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing
7180735 were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium
7180736 the largest urban park created in europe for more than 150 years
7180737 a huge amount of our investment in the olympic park is for legacy we are cleaning up the land burying overhead power lines upgrading roads and railways and installing new energy infrastructure
7180738 a site of this scale and quality within a few minutes of a great city centre must be almost unprecedented
7180739 we discovered it this morning it is the 452nd we have found in the last three years
7180740 we need their experience after all they are experts they have to combat tunnels dug by mexicans to cross into the united states
7180741 we are already finding more tunnels ourselves more than 200 this year but we want to use their more successful methods of tunnel detection and destruction
7180742 it is the semi permanent closure of the rafah crossing after the arrival of hamas in gaza which has led to the increase in smuggling tunnels
7180743 before hamas seized power the crossing was opened at least twice a week allowing normal and legal passage of palestinians of aid and provisions
7180744 the longer the israeli blockade lasts the more you will find weapons ammunition and drugs before the contraband was more harmless like food fuel or cigarettes
7180745 the police regularly find arms caches in the sinai desert west of the crossing the weapons never make it as far as the border

7180778 we downgraded the stock because it had really peaked out
7180779 we thought the stock got a little bit ahead of itself

7180782 questions to tell you if you have trouble with alcohol
7180783 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7180784 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7180785 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it

7180790 i called department of agriculture within five minutes and they were at my house within fifteen minutes we all understood what we had on our hands
7180791 they transmit viruses they weaken the hive by sucking the blood
7180792 now its on the big island and thats a disaster for agriculture
7180793 clearly the department of agriculture did not even attempt to contain it to the island of oahu
7180794 when the infestation was discovered on oahu we implemented an interisland quarantine to prevent live bees dead bees used bee equipment between islands
7180795 weve been trying our darndest not to let the bees move
7180796 coqui frog is bad nettle catepillar is bad but nothing compares to what varroa mite will do to our food supply
7180797 very easy to criticise the department that we did not do enough im not sure what more we could have done
7180798 if we loose the ability to transfer this pollen back and forth agriculture is gonna suffer and well have low grade crops and farmers will give up

7180819 she couldnt come up with michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
7180820 she couldnt understand why everyone is talking about that swimmer
7180821 with the cost of motoring on the up its more important than ever for drivers looking to change their car to make sure they get the best deal whether its bargaining on the forecourt or shopping around for the right finance package or insurance cover an hour or two of researching at home can make a real difference to your wallet

7180827 you have no idea how much that means to me
7180828 you should be careful make sure you tie the knot properly okay
7180829 thats right it was just an accident so calm down okay
7180830 im starting to get cold can we go inside risa chan
7180831 well i dont mind i dont want you to catch a cold
7180832 onii chan you shouldnt make her all jealous like that
7180833 its not that i dont trust you niigaki san in fact i think of you as an older sister but im just scared that youre going to steal eri chan away
7180834 eris not going anywhere i dont want to steal her away from anybody i just want her to be happy
7180835 can i ask why whenever i looked at you you would blush
7180836 still trying to adjust to seeing two girls together like that
7180837 by the way do you know what onii chan was talking about earlier before eri chan cut him off
7180838 well im sure if you look around room youll find an answer
7180839 do you want me to walk with you to the bus stop
7180840 the days are over before i realise that theyve begun
7180841 really thats good i wore this because i knew that you would like it
7180842 to be honest we were surprised at first but when i though about your history together i guess that it made sense if thats what you two decided if thats what makes you happy then we support you all the way after all risa chan is like another member of the family so we trust you
7180843 by the way do you know what onii chan was talking about earlier before eri chan cut him off
7180844 well im sure if you look around room youll find an answer
7180845 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7180846 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7180847 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7180848 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7180849 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7180850 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7180851 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7180852 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7180853 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7180854 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7180855 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7180856 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7180857 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7180858 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7180859 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7180860 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7180861 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7180862 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7180863 the bolt issue i take with a big smile i gave him what i believe to be fatherly advice
7180864 i stand by what i said he was the icon of the games together with michael phelps and i have great respect for his abilities
7180865 this kid deserves better there have been a lot of games that hes pitched where he could have won games and he hasnt
7180866 hes in our rotation and thats the bottom line i think it means a lot to him especially what hes been through to be able to come out and contribute at such an important time of year
7180867 i think this kind of sportsmanship and brotherhood is really remarkable
7180868 what touched me most was the attitude of this american shooter
7180869 i saw them hugging together and that was a nice moment
7180870 again leading and being very close to gold he took his rifle put his hand on the trigger and for some reason the trigger went off
7180871 this is a big failure i take responsibility but i will come back and i will win gold
7180872 this is the true spirit of the olympic games the games is not only about winning not only about being triumphant it is about the struggle of every athlete every day to achieve his or her own limits and having this resilience
7180873 it was a lot of fun knowing all my pitches were going for strikes
7180874 its the best feeling when youre rolling along like that
7180875 we got good pitching a long ball we manufactured runs and we caught the ball thats how you draw it up that is baseball at its best a nice clean game for us
7180876 you look up and he is hitting almost 300 292 and hes got almost 30 home runs and 100 rbis hes definitely as advertised as a hitter
7180877 pretty much they are getting what they paid for hes an awesome player
7180878 hes one of the guys thats built up and hes also experienced at this level
7180879 hes been a good soldier in the minor leagues being somewhat an experienced major league pitcher and performance
7180880 the biggest difference between the two ballclubs is they did what their coached asked them to do
7180881 we did not weve got to tighten up mainly from the neck up
7180882 we lost contain got beat on some post routes you cant play like that if you want to win conference
7180883 weve got to tighten up on our discipline just a little more

7180895 relaxing classical music is an effective intervention in reducing sleeping problems
7180896 music was not significantly better than tones or control conditions in improving sleep onset latency sleep efficiency wake time after sleep onset or percent slow wave sleep
7180897 when we decided to build the stadium i wanted to anticipate the possibility of financial restrictions so i concentrated on youth i also felt the best way to create an identity with the way we play football to get players integrated into our culture with our beliefs our values was to get them as young as possible and to develop them together i felt it would be an interesting experiment to see players grow together with these qualities and with a love for the club
7180898 it was an idealistic vision of the world of football
7180899 if arsenal want to match their stated ambition of competing with manchester united and chelsea this season then wenger is going to have to be a busy man this week

7180907 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy

7180915 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews

7180918 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
7180919 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
7180920 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7180921 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7180922 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7180923 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7180941 the beijing games have put an end to the notion that these olympics are a force for good

7180943 over the past 20 to 30 years china was still in the eyes of the world an under developed country the olympic games has allowed the world to see what china has become
7180944 a glass is either half full or half empty and i believe it is half full
7180945 the international olympic committee themselves recognize that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
7180946 to stay in the game asean must become a strong integrated region
7180947 what we are seeing is that asean is at the focal point of all these trade agreements
7180948 eventually when you consolidate the ftas it is possible that you could end up with something like that an asia wide fta
7180949 substantial gains could be realized from consolidating the many ftas into a single region wide one
7180950 governments need to connect the poor to the thriving regional economy by eliminating labor market barriers investing in workers capabilities and building infrastructure to connect disadvantaged regions with economic centers
7180951 we are witnessing the beginnings of a strong prosperous outward looking asian economic community regionally integrated yet connected with global markets and with responsibility and influence to match its economic weight
7180952 i began reading the text of mccains address on the georgia crisis and as i was browsing it the irregularity jumped out almost immediately
7180953 wheres someone in a hurry going to get basic information on the republic of georgia

7180956 diems luck held the coup leaders were disorganized and amateurish rather than seize the palace where diem and his brother were barricaded they preferred to talk they also failed to capture the radio stations and other communications centers and failed to set up roadblocks
7180957 american sigint had been surprised by the coup as had american intelligence in general
7180958 in the mad scramble for positioning that followed the viet cong in the nam bo saigon region directed subordinate elements to help soldiers officers and others politicians and security personnel involved in the coup to escape
7180959 were the communists on to something there is no doubt that they were correct in their assessment that the americans were disillusioned with diems failure to select a course of social reform and stick with it
7180960 real concern that either the soviets or the chinese communists or both would go beyond the supply flights and directly intervene in the fighting on 14 december 1960 the nsa director vadm laurence l frost institute a sigint readiness condition bravo on a theaterwide level throughout the far east

7180969 the utility of analyzing the war on terrorism using an insurgency counterinsurgency conceptual framework additionally the recommendations can be applied to the strategic campaign even if it is politically unfeasible to address the war as an insurgency
7180970 obviously enough you cannot command what you do not control therefore unity of command between agencies or among government and non government actors means little in this environment
7180971 depends less on a shared command and control hierarchy and more on a shared diagnosis of the problem i e the distributed knowledge of swarms platforms for collaboration information sharing and deconfliction each player must understand the others strengths weaknesses capabilities and objectives and inter agency teams must be structured for versatility the ability to perform a wide variety of tasks and agility the ability to transition rapidly and smoothly between tasks
7180972 against internal and external threats and preserving sovereignty over territory if a government cannot ensure security rebellious armed groups or criminal nonstate actors may use violence to exploit this security gap as in haiti nepal and somalia
7180973 an inability to do so creates a capacity gap which can lead to a loss of public confidence and then perhaps political upheaval in most environments a capacity gap coexists with or even grows out of a security gap in afghanistan and the democratic republic of the congo for example segments of the population are cut off from their governments because of endemic insecurity and in postconflict iraq critical capacity gaps exist despite the countrys relative wealth and strategic importance
7180974 this pillar most engages military commanders attention but of course military means are applied across the model not just in the security domain while civilian activity is critically important in the security pillar also all three pillars must develop in parallel and stay in balance while being firmly based in an effective information campaign
7180975 arrests and violations of the nfl conduct code have become an unfortunate trend amongst the leagues players
7180976 and its an excellent way for us to make some money
7180977 5 is your friend and teammate braylon edwards plotting some sort of revenge after gashing his foot a couple weeks ago nah laughs hes just working to get back he will be fine hes taking care of his foot and he will be ready soon
7180978 hey remember that time you hurt the all pro wr
7180979 kelly shoppach and ryan garko will likely be the odd men out
7180980 my guess is that sal fasano and andy gonzalez will be the odd men out
7180981 why did the browns fall short of the playoffs last season
7180982 hafner is done he will never play well in this league again
7180983 and it is possible to get a harvard education at the university of minnesota just as it possible to get a
7180984 the first priority for any government facing an insurgency is to establish a secure environment
7180985 gaining and maintaining the support of the population is the overall goal and path to victory since the population is the center of gravity therefore it is imperative for long term success that the population views the government as legitimate it is equally important for the us effort to be viewed as legitimate versus being viewed as an occupier or supporting a puppet government
7180986 it is also important for the governments internal defense efforts to be legitimized accepted and supported by the international community
7180987 if done correctly the first three lines should de legitimize the insurgents and lead to their lasting defeat this line will attack the hard core insurgents some may succumb to offers of amnesty but most will need to be killed or captured through offensive operations
7180988 as the internal security forces are trained the coalition will transition to only protecting the nation from external threats until such a time as the actual national military force is trained equipped and can conduct unilateral operations
7180989 the end state is a legitimate government that the population trusts and is able to detect and defeat internal and external threats
7180990 interfere with impartiality as well as undermine long term programs
7180991 an example would be if a commander directed execution of civil action projects that fall outside his authority rebuilding structures training local nationals and other activities may be good for the local population but they may be beyond the mandate and mission
7180992 ensuring that rule of law to protect property and the right of the public
7180993 transparency in a developing governments decision making its allocation of budgetary funds and its administration of the rule of law must also be promoted
7180994 a vital point here is that the realities of modernity technical social political are inexorable
7180995 as a group they were progressive moderates categorically opposed to terrorism
7180996 the gravest crisis in the world today turns on the question of how to prevent a destructive confrontation between the west and the whole of islam if there is an answer it lies in persuading the great majority of muslims totaling some 2 billion people to choose modernity and moderation and to reject the blind alley offered by its nihilist minority in this context a 200 000 state department program aimed at explaining the basic tenets and promises of american democracy to future leaders of south asia looks more cost effective than a 400 billion defense budget
7180997 cannot simply avoid or wish away dealing with local elites for ultimately their actions not those of the external power will strengthen or undermine institutions money especially money given to governments for their help against an external enemy cannot buy legitimacy
7180998 third in using short term measures to resolve complex crises an external power must be careful not to inadvertently exacerbate the situation or create new problems altogether
7180999 the bloody civil war consumed afghanistan paving the way for the taliban and al qaeda to take control of the government
7181000 community empowerment and citizens to play a greater role in determining afghanistans destiny acs is committed to increasing public participation in the decision making process through democracy building policy development and independent media
7181001 to be credible in such messages the hn government as well as other policy influencers such as clerics educators politicians and media need to condemn the acts while recognizing grievances
7181002 in a struggle for legitimacy founded on justice can a government execute its opponents without trial that was what assassination of insurgent leaders amounted to in el salvador and vietnam
7181003 indirect support focuses on building strong national infrastructures through economic and military capabilities that contribute to self sufficiency
7181004 the arabs loved them as they showed the solidarity of the soldiers hand in hand
7181005 create dissension disorganization low morale subversion and defection within insurgent forces as well as help discredit them
7181006 gain preserve and strengthen civilian support for the hn government and its counterinsurgency programs
7181007 avoid anything that can be turned against hn forces by insurgents
7181008 gain the support of uncommitted groups inside and outside the hn
7181009 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7181010 yes he may not be aggressive on the base paths he may not be a fan of bunting ever and he just couldnt get along with brandon phillips
7181011 its been hard fought to get all of these medals to come out and play against australia is kind of like how the story had to go
7181012 i had never seen them before i was just looking at them in the locker room like wow to know thats 12 years of dedication to usa basketball
7181013 thats the reason why we are a dynasty because of someone like her who continues to give back
7181014 they all tell the story about how they were little and how they used to watch me growing up and how they wanted to be like me and they met me at a camp and got my autograph
7181015 i dont look old but im feeling it the more i hear their stories i wish them the best of luck but they got a chance to get their first one with me like i did with teresa edwards and katrina mcclain i showed them the way in some ways im handing over to them sylvia is prepared candace is prepared even more because shes my teammate in la they have to keep it going
7181016 we target egregious employers those who have built their business model on hiring an illegal workforce
7181017 this practice undercuts legal law abiding companies and can create an environment where employee welfare and labor standards are not enforced
7181018 the brethren direct me to say that the church has never announced a definite doctrine upon this point some of the brethren have held the view that it was possible in the course of progression to advance from one glory to another invoking the principle of eternal progression others of the brethren have taken the opposite view but as stated the church has never announced a definite doctrine on this point
7181019 none would inherit this earth when it became celestial and translated into the presence of god but those who would be crowned as gods all others would have to inherit another kingdom they would eventually have the privilege of proving themselves worthy and advancing to a celestial kingdom but it would be a slow process progress
7181020 once a person enters these glories there will be eternal progress in the line of each of these particular glories but the privilege of passing from one to another though this may be possible for especially gifted and faithful characters is not provided for
7181021 i am not a strict constructionalist believing that we seal our eternal progress by what we do here it is my belief that god will save all of his children that he can and while if we live unrighteously here we shall not go to the other side in the same status so to speak as those who lived righteously nevertheless the unrighteous will have their chance and in the eons of the eternities that are to follow they too may climb to the destinies to which they who are righteous and serve god have climbed to those eternities that are to come
7181022 it is reasonable to believe in the absence of direct revelation by which alone absolute knowledge of the matter could be acquired that in accordance with gods plan of eternal progression advancement from grade to grade within any kingdom and from kingdom to kingdom will be provided for but if the recipients of a lower glory be enabled to advance surely the intelligences of higher rank will not be stopped in their progress and thus we may conclude that degrees and grades will ever characterize the kingdoms of our god eternity is progressive perfection is relative the essential feature of gods living purpose is its associated power of eternal increase
7181023 jesus had not finished his work when his body was slain neither did he finish it after his resurrection from the dead although he had accomplished the purpose for which he then came to the earth he had not fulfilled all his work
7181024 when the spirit is too old to approach god all are within the reach of pardoning mercy who have not committed the unpardonable sin
7181025 were going to take two or three shots with jason both over middle deep and on the side deep
7181026 we want to see him crank the ball down the field do i care whether its complete or not yeah sure but i want to see us all handle that kind of play theres a couple of shots were going to take here and i think thats important
7181027 when that happened i did not want to put jason now into another long developing play and risk another sack
7181028 when you think about the amount of information published to the web its a physical impossibility for the vast majority of that stuff to spread virally
7181029 its much more difficult to reach people today and much more expensive
7181030 the cost of media is accelerating and the ineffectiveness of media is accelerating

7181033 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7181034 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7181035 but as ive said for a long time records are meant to be broken i certainly thought that by this time someone would have won it twice
7181036 i thought that the way he ran a year ago was extremely impressive i thought maybe he should have gotten some consideration even last year
7181037 its an honor and a blessing to even be mentioned in the same sentence with the heisman trophy
7181038 for guys like archie to say something like that thats incredible
7181039 we didnt think we played well we had a lot of senior players down but in the last quarter our boys found a way to win which was the most important thing
7181040 i know they got close to us at the end but we came from seven points down at three quarter time and got ourselves three goals ahead that was a pretty fair turnaround
7181041 i think the doctors pretty much know how to estimate the damage there off the bat when its as bad as it apparently is
7181042 i guess everything there is subject to the scanning and all that but it certainly isnt good
7181043 it would depend on how bad it is but if it requires surgery its a six month injury
7181044 not many people get to go out on their own terms in this sport and that would be very sad for him if he missed a big farewell
7181045 im sure the club would still give him a magnificent farewell but its not the way he would like to have gone out hed like to go out with his boots on im sure
7181046 next week is such a big occasion for the newcastle club with all the ex players coming back into town
7181047 me personally ill be having a chat to the boys and trying extra hard to try and get this game up for bedsy and also getting in the semis because i know how proud he would be watching on the sidelines
7181048 theres no doubt were finishing the season very poorly this is three years in a row this has happened in the last month and were finishing about the same 10 or 11 wins we cant get past that
7181049 were going to have to move some players on simple as that
7181050 i said at the start of the season this is a watershed year for the club we cant finish this year waiting for potential to happen and waiting for players even our own juniors who we thought might go another level who havent its time to bite the bullet and go look for some players to improve the club
7181051 weve had three years to improve on 05 and to win a comp and not make the semis i think changes have to be made
7181052 i dont know what sort of changes but we cant keep going on doing the same things coming up with the same results
7181053 it was probably the response that we needed it was all about righting the ship a little bit
7181054 were just still a little loose in our defence that we need to correct
7181055 i wouldnt rate parramatta or manly on our performance the last couple of weeks
7181056 take this flush it down the toilet then go fuck your mother
7181057 we have students working everywhere from sidney to cincinnati from xenia to richmond
7181058 were ready to ramp this up and get as many of those people trained and back in the work force as we can
7181059 were both trying to cut costs as much as possible looking ahead and trying to prepare for the worst hoping that it doesnt happen
7181060 this announcement could hardly have been made at a worse time for the people whose jobs will be eliminated
7181061 the prospects of finding a comparable job in the airline industry are in a word grim our industry is contracting and most u s airlines are eliminating the jobs of pilots mechanics and other employees
7181062 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7181063 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7181064 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7181065 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7181066 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7181067 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7181068 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well

7181080 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said
7181081 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7181082 this proposal should never have been given serious consideration greenpeace climate campaigner john hepburn said
7181083 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland mr hepburn said
7181084 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change
7181085 about seven years ago the president of georgia proposed the cis heads of state to lock abkhasia in the
7181086 it was not the russians that caused that conflict in ossetia and abkhasia that was georgias problem that was a dispute between peoples
7181087 both the people of south ossetia and the people of abkhazia knew they cannot live as part of georgia a conflict emerged i remember the session of the cis heads of state when south ossetia and abkhazia expressed indignation on behalf of their nations the president of georgia asked the international community to interfere and bring peacemaking troops the ussr was collapsing at that time every one was overjoyed the international community didnt need these conflicts things were coming apart here and there nobody cared for abkhazia ossetia or transdniestria back then representatives of the international community didnt take turns protecting ossetia georgia or abkhazia on request of the president of georgia i remember it well we made a decision i was the first to say i will not send troops there our constitution disallows it russia had a lot of internal problems it was torn apart by conflicts and it had other things to see to russia wondered what should be done we the cis heads of state decided to convince the president of russia to send russian peacemakers to south ossetia and abkhazia i mean peacemakers were sent following a request of the president of georgia that is the truth what happened now russia fulfilled its duty as time passed not a single time did georgia say that the russian peacemakers should leave ossetia and some other peacemaking troops should be brought in you should read verbatim records russia has them every time the president of georgia thanked russia for its peacemaking efforts in south ossetia and abkhazia every single time he has never said never raised the issue although he could of removing the peacemaking troops he only thanked russia for keeping peace and russia had no other way out first it had to fulfil its peacemaking mission second did it have to accept the slap in the face calmly i also strongly object to claims that russia waged a war there was no war
7181088 there was an excellent operation carried out by russia and your people people protected their land the peacemakers fulfilled their mission the issue was dealt with within 2 3 days and peace was established what would have happened if peace hadnt been established like the usa and the west demand now there would have been war and bloodshed when i saw west figures come here to make publicity and make some statements i emphatically said we are not participating in it because they are telling totally different things they have forgotten the prehistory of the conflict they have forgotten everything you shouldnt kick abkhazia ossetia or russia for behaving the way they did they did it on request of the president of georgia as i have reminded already i told dmitry medvedev yesterday i am not going to make my presence in all the hubbub saying that i support somebody or dont approve of somebody here is our view russia acted in the right way and it acted like that because it was our decision the decision made by the cis heads of state only one more thing might have been done the day after russia should have gathered the cis heads of state and tell them that it had acted on their own request
7181089 we very much appreciate your support your condolences expressed to our people people in south ossetia know your position and we understand what pressure has been exerted on belarus by the forces that organised the aggression i should express my gratitude to both belarusian people and the natives of belarus who live in south ossetia
7181090 neither abkhasia nor south ossetia will be a part of georgia and nobody will make us stay there
7181091 your people are very kind and hard working just like the people in belarus
7181092 do come to belarus with any delegation and we will conclude an agreement at the interstate level to which we will adhere unswervingly our government has developed the respective mechanisms for it
7181093 it is very profitable for us to cooperate with kabardino balkaria
7181094 it is impossible to treat the belarusian people with disrespect these are open decent and kind people
7181095 at last we have arrived at an understanding the two urgent issues concerning the unions property and the united air defense system will be settled this year
7181096 whether the sides will adjust the document taking into consideration the situation with the us missile defense installations will be clear by the time of signing
7181097 surely certain political forces will soon initiate revising the model of ukraines participation in the cis in the ukrainian parliament i dont think the walkout from the cis will be adopted
7181098 we have to analyze our cooperation again and stir up the interaction between our cities
7181099 the links between minsk and sendai should become stronger there are all the necessary prerequisites for that
7181100 the majority of the most important indices demonstrate a growing tendency as against the same period of 2007 over the seven months the country met 17 out of 19 most important socio economic development forecast
7181101 this news comes at a critical time as belarus prepares for parliamentary elections next month i very much hope the positive momentum will continue and allow the european union and belarus to rapidly develop closer relations
7181102 the release of these individuals combined with what we hope will be further positive steps offers the real possibility of a significant improvement in relations
7181103 we hope there will be further progress building on this achievement the next step will be the conduct of the parliamentary election on 28 september
7181104 basically he said this is the only option to return and she said no
7181105 we are backing tanya in whatever decision she wants to make
7181106 they should let tatsiana go back to belarus sooner rather than later tomorrow is the last chance for her to get on an airplane go to belarus get reunited with her grandmother finish her studies and do everything the right way
7181107 the decision of tatsiana and the zapatas to stay here creates a bad and dangerous precedent
7181108 it means that other children from belarus on summer respite can take advantage of the situation of staying in the u s to apply for legalization and stay
7181109 we believe the sooner she returns the better but she is our citizen
7181110 if she chooses to return she will always be welcome
7181111 decisions that are not in tanyas best interest are being made by people who are not her legal guardians
7181112 the decision of the zapata family to hold the child violates the provision of the agreement
7181113 even with all these things that were offered to her she is still fearful very fearful to go back her life isnt going to be normal there anymore
7181114 my question to belarus was why are you offering princess tanya all of these things but you didnt care about the 1 400 other children whose program you were canceling why are you pushing so far for this one child
7181115 when the zapatas go to bed at night they should lie there and think of 1 400 children that are crying and hoping that they can see their american mama and their american papa next year
7181116 children crying big tears because one family has decided to be selfish in keeping her
7181117 i dont know what is legally available to her now
7181118 i havent dug too far i will now as soon as i have an extra moment i will start now
7181119 by entering belarus generali ppf is now operative in 13 different markets in the cee central eastern europe region
7181120 this trial is example of cynicism and treachery of the authorities
7181121 i didnt expect this decision we presented good proofs to the court that show this case is fabricated it is an example of fraud cynicism and treachery of the current belarusian authorities
7181122 we asked for them to give us reasons of the judgement
7181123 we simply want respect for our state for our people for our values
7181124 people gather to support our fraternal ukrainian nation which is groaning under the pressure of nato
7181125 of course ukraine is easy to split it is two different countries
7181126 the easts economy depends on russia the wests depends on europe the east is russian speaking and orthodox and the west is ukrainian speaking and roman catholic
7181127 everyone is talking about the same issue everyone is against the way georgia behaved i also support russia
7181128 we are all the same russia and ukraine and sevastopol are bound so tightly in a knot that it is difficult to untangle it
7181129 it has been lonely and sometimes it is hard england seemed like a relatively stable country but now the price of things is going up and we have to work harder just to keep going
7181130 so many poles came to the uk the polish government needs to do more they have a responsibility to protect their citizens
7181131 i want to make sure that the polish government realises there are a lot of citizens here and they need to make sure their investments in the embassy and consulate are appropriate
7181132 depression is a big problem for poles living in britain
7181133 we try to support them somehow but there are no special services
7181134 people say it should be easier you have a child of your own now
7181135 the first day she came she couldnt even say our names
7181136 and we couldnt say hers we called her marsha for days
7181137 i do want to see my friends but i dont want to go cause i like it here
7181138 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7181139 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said

7181144 i would like to thank all those who have offered their love and support
7181145 my main concern at the moment is the welfare of our family
7181146 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7181147 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7181148 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience
7181149 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7181150 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7181151 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7181152 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7181153 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7181154 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7181155 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7181156 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7181157 i made a mistake i should have gone straight to my question i was trying to put him at ease
7181158 the person who took care of all the business was my mother my father had no idea about the family business what oil leases he owned in oklahoma
7181159 not enough people in enough crucial states will vote for a semi black metro sexual especially when they get through calumniating him id never vote for him myself but hes probably preferable i figure hed only be as bad as bush mccain i think is unbalanced enough to start a nuclear war and not stupid enough to be managed by others
7181160 many hillary supporters half according to the most recent nbc wsj poll do not want to vote for obama with nader on the ballot they have another choice to lodge their vote with other than mccain
7181161 bad and over blown historical analogies wont help resolve the conflict
7181162 the coming diesel disaster will be caused by several other things that have nothing to do with the weather those factors include stringent new federal regulations on sulfur content in motor fuel a global shortage of refining capacity and soaring demand for diesel both in the united states and around the globe
7181163 distillates jet fuel kerosene diesel and other gasoil have become and will remain the main growth drivers of world oil demand
7181164 its going to be very hard to keep pace with growth in middle distillate demand
7181165 at the moment its demand for diesel that is driving the increased consumption
7181166 you are consuming far more oil than you otherwise would
7181167 cannot reverse because all the new demand is coming from diesel

7181175 when i came to beavercreek i had guys who couldnt play football and thats why they ran cross country my theory was to convince them that hey only you can do it once we got that straightened around because kids wanted to be a part of a great tradition it just even became more fun
7181176 if he is in no condition to play the game he is not going to play that is the same as any other player
7181177 he didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him
7181178 if thats they definition of an upgrade they some triflin negroes
7181179 the tss crew has been snuffed were taking over now more to come

7181185 there wasnt a dry eye on the unit this morning
7181186 hed been close to death many times but this time he was about as severe as he could be
7181187 i go in once a day and pray for him
7181188 to see him open his eyes and he cant say anything its too much to go through but i let him know ill be here as long as hes here
7181189 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7181190 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7181191 for mr trump this acquisition was not business related but as he has stated was meant to help out an american icon
7181192 if another buyer should emerge who will create the benefit mr trump sought for ed mcmahon then he is clearly pleased
7181193 it basically is taking a net and raking it on the bottom and anything that sticks up from the bottom gets bulldozed over it is similar to forest clear cutting
7181194 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7181195 theres been no violence reported from anywhere and weve taken adequate security measures to deal with any law and order problems
7181196 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7181197 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7181198 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7181199 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7181200 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7181201 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7181202 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7181203 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7181204 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7181205 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7181206 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7181207 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7181208 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7181209 its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7181210 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7181211 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
7181212 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake
7181213 i try to keep that as independent from my work as possible

7181215 itching is only a problem if there is hair loss redness of the skin open wounds or parasites
7181216 it is your job to give your mouse another habit to take his or her mind off the itching try giving your mouse lots of distractions things that often work best are those that the mouse can climb chew and shred
7181217 if liverpool keeps on playing like they did against sunderland and boro
7181218 it was after batman and i didnt care much cause ive seen it like three times now and now all i can say is thats too bad heath ledger is dead
7181219 the last one i saw it with my whole family it was a little uncomfortable because my parents are truly homophobics especially my dad he would kill himself if i were homosexual

7181230 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
7181231 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university
7181232 abu huraira reported allahs messenger may peace be upon him as saying the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them until the jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say muslim or the servant of allah there is a jew behind me come and kill him
7181233 the passage you cited is truly despicable and i share your concerns about its being on the usc server we did some investigations and i have ordered the passage removed
7181234 the passage in the hadith that you brought to our attention violates the usc principles of community and it has no place on a usc server
7181235 no one has the right to denigrate another human being on the basis of race sex sexual orientation national origin etc we will not tolerate verbal or written abuse threats harassment intimidation or violence against person or property
7181236 we commend usc for having the moral courage to stand up against those who hijack speech and religious freedoms and the goodwill of the campus community in order to spread hate and extremist violence
7181237 it also shows what kind of an organization the muslim students association is which is why the freedom center has launched a nationwide campaign stop the jihad on campus week which will culminate the week of october 13
7181238 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7181239 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7181240 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7181241 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7181242 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7181243 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7181244 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7181245 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7181246 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7181247 i cant believe the number of nationally significant stories that are associated with dayton
7181248 honestly its been slow but i think that the community is recognizing its history more and more
7181249 after all these years am i finally going to get my chance
7181250 whom do i like most or which one do i agree with most or which one will do the most for me and mine
7181251 which one would be least likely to go to war for primarily personal political or party reasons which would be least turned aside in his effort to be more ethical than practical which as commander in chief would be least likely to turn down an opportunity for dialogue as a first step in confronting a presumed enemy which one would be least likely to see a position of power as our countrys most needed global image which would be least tempted to think that being seen as a real man is the most important personal caricature of an international leader
7181252 which one will sit in the oval office during lonely hours of bothersome darkness think about what it really means to be at the helm of the ship of state of conceivably the current worlds greatest nation to date and
7181253 most of all we must think of and be there for the least of these our brothers and sisters in our world wide family of nations
7181254 george bush has retreated to his ranch in texas fifty times so far taking vacations from his duties totaling a full year
7181255 they are working vacations on such occasions he is just as connected via communications to the various arms of government as he is when he is in washington and he receives official delegations from other countries or leaves the ranch on presidential business on the average twice a week in fact his logs show that he spends five hours every day carrying out official duties besides his long vacations coincide with congress being out of session and away from washington
7181256 the president has called ted kennedy unpatriotic for exercising his constitutionally mandated right to dissent in fact it is more patriotic to dissent than not to question a dishonest or incompetent administration
7181257 evidence shopping or he is citing an alternative definition or phrasing of his original predicate to the definition or phrasing he employed initially
7181258 convictions relate to governing or normative principles whereas opinions relate to the application of those principles
7181259 you know mark you shouldnt let this get you down there must be something else in manitowoc or two rivers that you can photograph so this evening isnt a complete waste
7181260 the tab to elect someone to replace the late u s rep stephanie tubbs jones will likely cost ohio taxpayers between 4 million and 5 5 million according to estimates by the cuyahoga county board of elections
7181261 its a real question whether the state should be on the hook for that large an expenditure for someone who is going to be in office for such a short period of time
7181262 cada crian a ao nascer traz nos a mensagem de que deus n o perdeu a esperan a no homem
7181263 basically what were going to have in this race is barack obama and joe biden both of whom grew up with very little and both of whom worked their way up and know what hardworking regular families are feeling
7181264 i dont know that biden was selected primarily for his electoral strengths
7181265 my guess is he wont add much to obamas candidacy in midwestern states
7181266 obamas lack of experience and celebrity status does not make for the type of leader wisconsinites are looking for
7181267 senator biden has had a distinguished career fighting for american families at home and exhibiting strong leadership on issues abroad
7181268 the obama biden ticket is an exciting ticket that will win in november
7181269 ive disagreed with him but biden is somebody ive always been able to sit down with and discuss the issues
7181270 hes a very good colleague in that regard i dont remember having a bad word with him
7181271 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7181272 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7181273 the next president the next vice president of the united states
7181274 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7181275 he doesnt sugarcoat hes going to be absolutely invaluable in standing up to mccain and his running mate
7181276 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7181277 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds
7181278 you talk about how much youre worried about paying the bills thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7181279 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7181280 the first mainstream african american candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7181281 biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7181282 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7181283 he adds experience foreign policy weight catholic working class roots and an aggressive campaign style
7181284 a few gaffes are likely to be more than balanced by his ability to challenge mccains judgment on national security matters
7181285 the type of person who got away with a lot simply because she refused to ask permission for the priviledge of being herself
7181286 i even wrote a letter to the president telling him he should start a monthly book club with all the other world leaders the only catch is i get to choose the books for them the first one would be the feminine mystique the second would be krishnamurtis think on these things and the third would be huckleberry finn
7181287 you dont have to get hit in the head to get a head injury it creates a concussive effect where the brain is bouncing around the skull
7181288 i got to know matt a little bit through his project
7181289 and i have been impressed with his perseverance on his project bob and lisa are good friends and words cannot describe what kind of tragedy this is
7181290 right now there are those who are hurting who are asking why
7181291 right now during this moment may we go to you father and ask for your strength your wisdom and your courage may we take this time to understand how life is precious and a gift from you
7181292 you have rising ninth graders out here teachers and coaches were family what more can you say
7181293 the show of support for the family the show of love for the family was very touching but the fact that you are there on pins and needles for a 15 year old kid it tears at you literally tears at you
7181294 its a once in a lifetime one in a million hit for this to happen to a healthy kid
7181295 he was healthy and well padded he was still breathing on the field but basically they said the damage was done right then and there i have never heard of anything like it
7181296 people would say he is your guy and his older brother was too
7181297 just a good old hard nosed boy thats my kind of guy he did everything i said and asked questions later
7181298 he was just a precious kid i swear i felt real uncomfortable friday night and now its about 1 000 times worse when you know them and have been in their house this family is not just some family its a family that i know real well and i have grown to know and love them
7181299 its real hard the hardest thing i have ever done
7181300 i have to be a leader and be strong because those are my boys
7181301 there was nothing dramatic about it it was a regular old football play or it should have been
7181302 last year 1 8 million kids played high school football and there were three fatalities
7181303 you are more in danger driving to the mall than playing football but its like a plane crash its so visible
7181304 his injuries were severe and unsurvivable from the beginning we supported his breathing and he had neurosurgery within minutes of getting to the hospital
7181305 there were eye popping hits during the game that kids bounced right up from
7181306 sometimes its conspicuous that a kid has done something wrong but this was an ordinary play
7181307 so many things have happened to make football more safe but its still not 150 percent safe
7181308 it would appear this was a devastating injury that nothing could have been done about
7181309 thats small consolation to the mother in forsyth county who now wonders if she ever wants her kid to play the game
7181310 our biggest goal was to progress from week 2 to week 3 and i think we achieved that it is what it is its one game and well learn from it weve got to look at the tape and grow from it and move on to pittsburgh but it was a good good outing for us
7181311 weve wanted to be able to run the ball here for some time
7181312 weve had success in some years in 03 and 05 and when we havent we havent
7181313 tonight was a little factor of the ball bounced our way
7181314 but our guys executed well in all three phases i liked our pass rush defensively i thought our corners played well offensively i thought we ran the ball effectively and moved the ball in the passing game enough off play action although weve definitely got to get better on third down
7181315 we just took out a bunch of cars for no reason and ourselves
7181316 sometimes you get out of here with a perfect race car and sometimes you get wrecked
7181317 i for one just like to go and race and do my job the theatrical side of it is not entertaining at all to me but ive heard the fans really enjoy it
7181318 since the creation of mankind until the advent of doomsday no fitnah damage will be greater than that of the dajjals anti christ
7181319 verily the most honourable of you with allah is that believer who is most pious
7181320 be patient o family of yasir for your final destination is paradise
7181321 le sac igloo ls 500 kiwi medium 6 18 months now at 85 00 after 26 decrease in price
7181322 le sac igloo ls 500 kiwi medium 6 18 monthss price decreased 26 from 115
7181323 its like having a 3 year old and being mad because that 3 year old acts like a 3 year old you cant have a young driver and then give up on him because he acts like a young driver because he is a young driver
7181324 once you make that commitment youve got to be willing to see it through and help him mature
7181325 i agree with that and any time jeff burton says something you listen
7181326 hes exactly right im young and im dumb and im going to make mistakes
7181327 but even though im not running all the races this year im at every race sitting up on the pit box and watching trying to learn from others mistakes and put that in my memory banks
7181328 so even when im not in the car im trying to learn
7181329 yes david ragan has to get right up on the wheel now because hes trying to make the chase you have to go for everything and yes youre going to make mistakes
7181330 but thats what i like about my race team and my crew chief tony gibson they know im young and im going to make mistakes and theyre behind me we went to watkins glen had a decent car but i wheel hopped in turn one and flat spotted the tires and we had to pit under green but that was ok we knew what we were there for to get me laps so next season sonoma and watkins glen wont be an achilles heel
7181331 a lot of the media has brought that on dei and for whatever reason a lot of the stories about dei are negative
7181332 one thing leads to another and we get a lot of negative press which may be understandable because there have been a lot of ups and downs at dei over the last few years
7181333 but if we build good cars and go out and run good all that will take care of itself the sponsors it all goes back to on the track you have to perform and i think dei is doing that
7181334 except for martin not making the chase this year after making it last year hes getting back on track hes been running good the last couple of weeks had a good run at watkins glen
7181335 paul is further up in points than he was last year
7181336 it was as hot today as it was in florida
7181337 it was sticky out there and youre sweating a lot
7181338 i know hes tied a personal best but hes not satisfied at all
7181339 hes one of these guys thats busted his tail to put himself in this position hes been just unbelievable for us
7181340 he keeps our guys loose the players like him hes part of our good chemistry
7181341 he makes the guys around him not only better players but better people off the field hes a class guy
7181342 hopefully im the same as i was the first day i walked in there
7181343 i have a good time with the guys i like to come to the ballpark every day with a good attitude and expecting to win and lead by example
7181344 i think thats the thing about our clubhouse weve got a lot of guys who are big professionals they show up every day and work their tails off before we even step across the white lines tio play the game
7181345 to win baseball games help this team win and get himself a nice contract next year which he deserves
7181346 outside of arizonas brandon webb there arent too many people pitching better
7181347 its great its a nice feeling to have but at the same time theres a long way to go and ive got a lot of starts left
7181348 i think thats been a good approach for us so far
7181349 w inston salem now has the most beautiful and most modern minor league baseball park in the nation
7181350 it had been understood all along that the team could remain in the league only if new playing grounds were provided
7181351 the team performed most of the 1955 season in front of jerry built stands at southside park where little comfort and convenience were available to spectators
7181352 i think it will ensure us a modern baseball park and continuing professional baseball kurfees said
7181353 all our citizens should be grateful to mr babcock for this new evidence of his generosity
7181354 i always felt like it was a picture postcard park with the grassy area going all the way down one side and all the way down the other side
7181355 i came in here and said this is the big leagues compared to wellsville
7181356 not only did my sons literally grow up there i grew up there as well
7181357 you think about the history thats come through there since 1956 its pretty amazing
7181358 i mean the stadium had its quirks but it had a minor league feel and it had a heartbeat sometimes its heartbeat was strong and other seasons it wasnt so strong but it survived and thats something other cities cant say about their ballparks
7181359 australias gay capital sydney is set to try and enforce homophobia free zones which may see clubs and hotels lose their licence if patrons commit homophobic abuse or violence local media said

7181361 such a measure is greatly needed by indonesia as the biggest archipelagic country in the world with most of its territory covered by sea with 4 000 kilometer costal areas
7181362 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7181369 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7181370 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7181371 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7181372 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7181373 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7181374 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7181375 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7181376 it wasnt a terrible start it was encouraging he attacked the zone he was kind of efficient he kept the ball down
7181377 he just had trouble putting hitters away the two strike hits and two out runs got him
7181378 but im not going to do that im going to continue to work hard and get better
7181379 there were a few things that he needed to do
7181380 one was getting his fastball command back that was probably the no 1 issue the velocity were used to seeing would have been a bonus had that come all the way back his velocity came back a little bit
7181381 there also was the focus on the mound the concentration the not letting things get to him and not be so defensive in his approach to pitching and not worry about contact
7181382 and free his brain a little bit and realize theres more that he can do and just sharpen up his game
7181383 he did what we envisioned him going down and doing
7181384 hai isa sesungguhnya aku akan menyampaikan kamu kepada akhir ajalmu dan mengangkat kamu kepada ku serta membersihkan kamu dari orang orang yang kafir dan menjadikan orang orang yang mengikuti kamu di atas orang orang yang kafir hingga hari kiamat kemudian hanya kepada akulah kembalimu lalu aku memutuskan di antaramu tentang hal hal yang selalu kamu berselisih padanya
7181385 in the year and a half since i read the millioniare real estate agent book i have worked on one of the central goals that the book speaks about defining my big why has been a major challenge in my short time being coached by darin i am amazed at how quickly he was able to assist me to define my true big why thank you
7181386 the solutions coaching program that darin has introduced to our office has invigorated my business i am creating systems to automate my business strategies to increase my production and my skill level so that know what to say and when from implementing all this in the last month it has led to about 4 000 000 in business 36 new leads and more coming i am addicted to the sense of purpose that darins solutons coaching program gives you

7181400 they are jointly charged with murder assault with intent to rob and possessing a pistol for the commission of a crime further charges have not been ruled out
7181401 police enquiries are being made to determine the criminal liability of any other parties who may be involved
7181402 two search warrants have been executed at addresses in south auckland this morning and a number of items of interest have been located these will be now be forwarded for forensic analysis
7181403 police are confident there are other people who have knowledge of the events and circumstances that took place prior to and on the night of the murder
7181404 we would prefer these persons contact us rather than we go to them
7181405 police acknowledge the enormous cooperation and support that has been received from all sectors of the public and the general media
7181406 todays arrests are a direct result of this valuable assistance that has been provided to police
7181407 to our knowledge this is the first instance in which microcontact printing has been used to fabricate and position microbattery electrodes and the first use of virus based assembly in such a process
7181408 does not involve any expensive equipment and is done at room temperature
7181409 then we turn the stamp over and transfer the electrolyte and anode to a platinum structure
7181410 were also interested in integrating the batteries with biological organisms
7181411 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7181412 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7181413 gov daniels knows that the future of the american economy depends on clean technology automakers are in a global race to deliver a new generation of hybrid and advanced electric vehicles that reduce or eliminate our dependence on the gas pump
7181414 he has made an outstanding effort to make sure that indiana and its people play a key role in this new and growing market we would not be standing here today without his firm commitment to the future
7181415 eight hundred fifty jobs of any kind is great news when those jobs are in a technology of tomorrow like electric cars it offers the prospect of even bigger news to follow indiana has what it takes to lead this automotive revolution and today is step one
7181416 we believe that applieds state of the art wafering systems including its hct wire saws and squarers are the best choice to help us scale up capacity to meet the expanding global demand for wafers
7181417 we have used hct wire saws since the beginning of our manufacturing operations in 2006 and they have continued to demonstrate the performance necessary to deliver high quality cost effective wafers to our customers
7181418 we are very pleased to be selected by ldk solar for this milestone agreement the largest contract ever awarded for wafering systems
7181419 ldk solar is known for its advanced wafer production capability and applied materials is committed to providing ldk solar with the leading edge technology to meet its most critical performance requirements
7181420 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements
7181421 it might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers this would put what weve seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies
7181422 we are looking forward to investigating whether we can see these effects using thin layers of the same materials deposited directly on the silicon wafers these wafers are the same as those used by mass market electronics manufacturers as the basis for integrated circuits
7181423 with the end of moores law in sight mechanisms for controlling and understanding possible new information bits such as spins in solids are actively being sought after
7181424 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7181425 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7181426 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7181427 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7181428 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7181429 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7181430 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7181431 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7181432 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7181433 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7181434 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7181435 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem
7181436 there is a high prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in soldiers and the consortiums work is driven by that we believe the conclusions of our research also will benefit civilians including athletes who have suffered concussions
7181437 the award of this grant confirms the collaborative platform of mission connect is a powerful and pivotal force in research
7181438 uniting these premier scientists in this shared research effort will accelerate the pace of discovery and provide the courageous men and women in our military with the best possible medical care for the brain injuries they have sustained
7181439 this grant is a huge boost to research in traumatic brain injury and will allow investigators to work together through mission connect
7181440 for baylor college of medicine it will help fund 10 investigators in neurology neuroscience neurosurgery and pain management and physical rehabilitation
7181441 only through collaboration can we make great strides in restoring function for our young brave men and women in the armed forces
7181442 we in the medical field must serve these men and women by moving the frontiers of treatment faster to provide state of the art interventions now
7181443 an effort led by drs doug dewitt and donald prough of the moody center for brain and spinal cord injury mission connect at utmb is a pivotal component of the department of defense project leading the field with a new blast injury model that simulates the exposure to improvised explosive devices additionally innovative therapies using stem cells anti inflammatory agents growth hormones and the expertise of aggressive rehabilitation at the transitional learning center round out the critical components of utmbs efforts
7181444 oxidative stress is a prominent feature of traumatic brain injury
7181445 we have developed a new antioxidant agent based on carbon nanotubes and in collaboration with dr thomas kent of the baylor college of medicine we will examine the therapeutic potential of the agent to treat mild tbi
7181446 our ability to apply novel intervention strategies to nervous system trauma based on the cellular and molecular biology observations made over the years would suggest that we will be able to make an impact on the treatment modalities to be developed over the next five years
7181447 at utmb the neuroscience research community has a long tradition of excellence dedicated to the understanding of trauma to the nervous system we are very happy to be able to make a contribution to this joint texas effort in what is an exemplary example of translational efforts at utmb
7181448 the institutions that make up mission connect have a long history of working together successfully this significant grant is testament to the fact that our collaboration makes us more competitive for funding than any one of our schools would have been alone and more importantly it strengthens our ability to improve the lives of those affected by traumatic brain injury
7181449 the award is very forward thinking since in addition to clinicians it includes neuroscientists working to elucidate the very basic and fundamental causes of nervous system injury all the way down at the molecular and cellular level
7181450 at present we know very little about how brain injury disrupts the connections and communication among neurons the neuroscientists participating will fill this huge gap in our knowledge armed with this information and working together in a collaborative environment clinicians and neuroscientists stand a much better chance of designing new and innovative treatments for traumatic brain injury
7181451 congratulations to dr valadka and the team for receiving this very prestigious and competitive funding which will improve our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury the awarding of this grant validates our national stature in the neurosciences and will improve patient care and clinical outcomes for many patients
7181452 a model of innovative thinking and close collaboration between multiple institutions to understand and to advance the care of patients with mild traumatic brain injury
7181453 mild traumatic brain injury is a tremendous problem and there is an outstanding team in place ready to tackle it

7181460 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7181461 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7181462 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7181463 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7181465 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7181466 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7181467 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7181468 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7181469 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7181470 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

7181475 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7181476 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7181477 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7181478 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7181479 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7181480 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7181481 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7181482 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7181484 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7181485 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7181486 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7181487 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7181488 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7181489 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7181490 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7181491 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7181492 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7181493 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7181494 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7181495 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7181496 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7181497 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7181498 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7181499 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7181500 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7181501 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7181502 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7181503 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7181504 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

7181563 we set out to achieve a number of things such as including transport and agriculture into the scheme earlier a fund to insulate homes to keep power bills down targets for emissions reduction and support for new innovations that offer significant carbon reduction on some of the issues we have not been able to make progress we have not been able to get agreement to phase in transport instead it will come in in one lump in 2011 so this has not changed we have made very little progress on agriculture but we are still talking about this very importantly we have not found a way for government to accept a biodiversity standard to ensure that planting pines does not destroy biodiversity

7181573 como se puede comprobar en las distintas referencias hechas al respecto y que constan en actas oficiales por los miembros del gobierno municipal
7181574 hab a que revisar las cintas de las c maras
7181575 volvi a admitir que exist an grabaciones al menos 8 d as despu s de que se produjese la entrada de personas a las que se hace referencia
7181576 competen s lo a la comisi n de investigaci n
7181577 una sola causa no provoca nunca un accidente a reo son siempre una concatenaci n de causas
7181578 es el nico que tiene la capacidad de decidir sobre lo que ocurre a bordo del avi n tanto si se puede bajar como si no
7181579 no nos consta en este momento por qu y bajo qu circunstancias algunas personas no pudieron bajar del avi n
7181580 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7181581 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7181582 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7181583 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7181584 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7181585 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7181586 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7181587 the coalition forces have made mistakes so many times and killed so many civilians we are asking president karzai to come here
7181588 he wasnt just robbed of the gold medal but of the chance to be an olympic hero
7181589 after being knocked practically unconscious he made two of the greatest pressure free throws ever taken
7181590 i feel there should be a gold medal in our house and there isnt
7181591 i think what happened today is encouraging but unacceptable until the last russian soldier leaves my country
7181592 what they are still doing making explosions camping by the road digging positions does not look to me like cease fire it looks like warfare
7181593 we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
7181594 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territories and they need to do it
7181595 mobilize to their duty stations 8 a m sunday and monitor canals and levees in the city
7181596 we are prepared to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7181597 the storm is actually weakening thats not to say were not going to have rain
7181598 were still expecting some flooding because of this weve got everything on standby hopefully it wont come to that
7181599 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7181600 i can see some buying but it has slowed down a little bit i think they may be running out of bullets
7181601 whether or not it will be sustained i guess it really depends on what rhetoric we get from russia in the days ahead i believe its possible we may go on further from here
7181602 there seems to be a bit of a return to favour commodities again in the last couple of days i think the physical buying has helped to support it as well
7181603 i personally think platinum prices have reached their bottom but at this moment i couldnt confirm if automobile companies have started to buy
7181604 you expect that out of a runner like him i think hes a good back and hes going to be good for us
7181605 i think thats a little glimpse of what he can do
7181606 the truth is the lions havent had a real home run threat in the backfield since hall of famer barry sanders called it quits on the eve of training camp in 1999
7181607 its a sigh of relief im used to scoring a lot i scored 30 times last year i didnt want to leave the preseason without scoring if i got knocked out at the 1 yard line i was going to take off my uniform and quit
7181608 because the onset of symptoms of listeriosis can occur up to 70 days after contaminated food is consumed it is expected that the number of confirmed and suspected cases will continue to increase over the next several weeks
7181609 to see the world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour
7181610 the different styles of aimee mcmaster and jim wehtje really complement each another so far people have really responded to their photos theyre a perfect match for each other
7181611 ive been taking photos since i was a little girl ive always loved nature
7181612 everything in nature astounds me i believe things created by god are so beautiful
7181613 i think i see in nature things other people dont see its part of the gift of being an artist
7181614 it was the first thing that really clicked for me i like the scientific aspect of it
7181615 i think it fits me fine some people have to be creating all the time im the sort that has to mull things over
7181616 dolls are kind of freaky because they have all these wires and gears ive tried plates and forks and rocks but theres nothing inside them road kill can be interesting
7181617 the beautiful patterns that natural subjects often reveal under the tube make me feel that in the end we dont really create
7181618 we only discover how to see the beauty that is already there

7181633 me consta que la concejal a estaba intentando cambiar la ordenanza tiene ayudas para que las familias rehabiliten viviendas del pepri plan especial de protecci n y reforma interior de ciudad vieja y pescader a pero si ese edificio lo compra una empresa promotora para rehabilitarlo pierde todas las ayudas
7181634 si merece ser protegido y es un elemento arquitect nico valioso y hay que protegerlo muchas veces las familias no tienen capacidad de hacerlo y los edificios se acaban derrumbando a las familias les facilitan una ayuda bastante escasa que a lo mejor no les es suficiente

7181642 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7181643 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7181644 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7181645 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7181646 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7181647 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7181648 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7181649 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7181650 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7181651 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7181652 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7181653 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7181654 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7181655 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7181656 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7181657 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7181658 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7181659 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7181660 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7181661 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7181662 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7181663 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7181664 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7181665 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7181666 hay una lista con tres nombres colotto y otros dos l es una de las opciones que estamos considerando pero no es la nica
7181667 a n no se sabe seguro qu va a pasar con pablo si va a salir o se va a quedar pero no podemos estar sin movernos y luego encontrarnos con una sorpresa de ltima hora y quedarnos sin pablo el d a que se cierra el plazo ya no nos dar a tiempo a reaccionar
7181668 vamos a esperar pero el lunes o el martes deber a de haber novedades en un sentido u otro
7181669 si l se va tiene que venir otro eso seguro
7181670 hay que darle tiempo al tiempo todav a no s lo que har pero al europeo de polonia igual voy como comentarista de televisi n
7181671 despu s de esperar se ha confirmado una rotura fibrilar del adductor largo de la pierna derecha y del m sculo gracilis lesi n que le impide competir y que necesita dos o tres semanas de recuperaci n
7181672 algo que en un primer momento le dej abatido pero ahora se ha dado cuenta de que puede ayudar al equipo desde el banquillo con otros detalles
7181673 creo que se les puede ganar el partido del grupo contra ellos nos ha servido para saber en qu forma est n no tenemos que cogerlo como referencia porque nosotros podemos hacerlo mucho mejor de lo que lo hicimos sabemos que es una gran selecci n pero con la mentalidad que hemos tenido estos dos ltimos partidos ante croacia y lituania podemos ganarles
7181674 porque los precios son m s asequibles que en el centro
7181675 tienen cincuenta a os y las cubiertas est n muy mal y tambi n hace falta trabajar en las fachadas
7181676 no sabemos c mo va a ser ni lo que quieren hacer porque como pasa siempre en los ltimos tiempos el ayuntamiento no informa de nada
7181677 tambi n habr a que dar ayudas para el interior hay casas que todav a tienen cocina bilba na antigua
7181678 primero dijeron catorce despu s no sab an cu ntas el alcalde prometi que no se iban a hacer
7181679 tampoco sabemos c mo va a quedar el gora porque dicen que va a quedar muy despejada pero si lo miras bien no lo parece tanto el caso es que no nos informan de nada
7181680 de momento todo lo que hemos pedido lo hemos conseguido
7181681 estas viviendas s necesitan rehabilitarse tienen m s de cincuenta a os y tienen las cubiertas bastante mal adem s de necesitar que les pinten las fachadas
7181682 se acuerdan cuando quieren que les votemos o para sacarnos los cuartos
7181683 en donde viv a una familia ahora viven cuarenta con cuarenta coches y las constructoras invaden por donde pueden
7181684 ahora s aqu delante van a construir dos torres de miles de pisos
7181685 la zona del observatorio parece ideal para eso pero a la vista est que no va a ser
7181686 si cuando se rompe una farola pasan meses hasta que alguien viene a cambiarla
7181687 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7181688 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7181689 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7181690 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7181691 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7181692 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7181693 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7181694 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7181695 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7181696 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7181697 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7181698 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7181699 from one bereaved mother to another gana you are in my thoughts my baby boy died last june and you wouldnt wish it on any form of life
7181700 have they not heard a cow calling for days when her calves are removed
7181701 havent we been rather slow to recognise that animals have emotions
7181702 how do you know dogs and elephants feel joy or jealousy or embarrassment
7181703 one retort is to say how do you know they dont darwin said there was continuity in evolution so the differences between species are differences in degree rather than differences in kind theyre shades of grey
7181704 if we feel jealousy then dogs and wolves and elephants and chimpanzees feel jealousy animal emotions are not necessarily identical to ours but theres no reason to think they should be their hearts and stomachs and brains also differ from ours but this doesnt stop us from saying they have hearts stomachs and brains theres dog joy and chimpanzee joy and pig joy and dog grief chimpanzee grief and pig grief
7181705 i have seen or believe that i have seen in birds impatience frustration anxiety in the urge to impart news affection fear amusement the last being a difficult one i admit to prove merely on the basis of watching the look on a magpies face as its booby trap was successful and particularly joy
7181706 to have a magpie on seeing me weep hover on top of the fridge wings outstretched tremble for a few moments then fly down to my knee to crouch squeaking quietly edging ever nearer until his body was close against mine seemed to me at the time as it does now an act of an unexpected tenderness that i can interpret only as empathy there may be other explanations of their behaviour but i cant think what they might be
7181707 the fact is that fish show fear rodents can empathise this is hard science with birds and mammals there is no doubt that they have a very rich ensemble of emotions
7181708 we are animals and we have a kind of empathy with the animal kingdom theyre our kin there is a slight difference between a cat and a dog and a chimp and a female human and a male one and a black human and a white one these differences are very small 98 of our dna is the same as in other animals such as primates
7181709 there used to be a time when people thought that animals had no soul just as they thought that slaves or africans or women had no soul we realised a long time ago as jains that animals have souls they do feel pain and joy mostly they feel what we feel animals have empathy and intelligence we have to be humble and accept that we are only one kind of animal and these are others
7181710 living things like trees and vegetation have only one sense touch then you have two senses touch and taste the animals that eat then there are animals with a third sense smell fourth are the ones that have sight too and then hearing intelligence is limited in these cases because they get their information through fewer senses than us
7181711 but look at people who are not literate literacy is a relatively new thing before that we had only an oral culture that does not mean that people lacked intelligence just techniques
7181712 so even mosquitos have something even viruses and fungi have intelligence nature is full of intelligence that intelligence manifests in different ways a tree knows how to bear fruit
7181713 the eyes tell it all if we can stand it we should look into the fear filled eyes of animals who suffer at our hands in horrible conditions of captivity in slaughterhouses and research labs fur farms zoos rodeos and circuses dare to look into the sunken eyes of animals who are afraid or feeling all sorts of pain and then try to deny to yourself and to others that these individuals are feeling anything i bet you cant
7181714 a very intelligent cat looked at me and asked why me i couldnt find the words to tell him why or how badly i felt for torturing and killing him
7181715 there are three ways we can listen to what people say they feel measure body temperature and heart rate and hormonal levels and observe behaviour unfortunately the three emotional systems do not necessarily correlate with each other sometimes for example strong subjective emotions occur with no obvious autonomic changes as when someone experiences a rapid switch from excitement to fear on a roller coaster
7181716 access is limited because we cant really get into the head or heart of another being and that includes other people
7181717 i often imagine a dinner table conversation between a scientist and his or her child concerning research in which the nature of mother infant bonds is studied by taking the infant away from their mother
7181718 parent oh i removed two baby chimpanzees from their mother to see how they reacted to this treatment
7181719 child do you think the baby minded being taken from her mother
7181720 parent well im not sure thats why i did it
7181721 child but what do you think the babys fighting to get back to her mother and her writhing and screaming meant
7181722 pickens clean secret prop 10 would put california taxpayers on the hook for his natural gas plan
7181723 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7181724 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7181725 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7181726 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7181727 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7181728 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7181729 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7181730 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7181731 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7181732 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7181733 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7181734 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7181735 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7181736 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7181737 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7181738 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7181739 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7181740 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7181741 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7181742 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7181743 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7181744 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7181745 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7181746 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7181747 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7181748 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7181749 zombie nation re humanizing america in the face of crippling narcissism
7181750 much of what he explored in zombie nation was the root cause of much of the chaos economic and otherwise that americans are now experiencing
7181751 he was truly a good soul who made a difference in peoples lives our last work together was about learning to be authentic the remedy for what ails us
7181752 zombie nation re humanizing america in the face of crippling narcissism
7181753 how much love does it have in the doing of it
7181754 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7181755 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7181756 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7181757 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7181758 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7181759 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7181760 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7181761 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7181762 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7181763 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7181764 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7181765 te pasas los a os de la mocedad con el coraz n encendido convencido de poder quemar los rastrojos de la injusticia en cada jard n en cada horizonte en cada planeta
7181766 david i want to make a song and a video for this lita presentation i am doing in the fall something that both you and i could do together and can both believe in and get behind im nervous about this presentation for some reason but i also see it as a great opportunity to help get the word out about what we both believe in when it comes to society and library futures and technology i have some basic song idea and all the lyrics ready would you like to help me make a song and a video
7181767 we are still not certain why males exist and why if we must have them at all nature needs so many
7181768 although the reason for the existence of women is obvious enough nobody has any real idea what point there is in being a man
7181769 they dress in provocative gears that reveal as much flesh as any professional when the average teen girl is old enough she wants to go out and have sex where and when she wishes with any lad who takes her fancy and her biggest ambition is to sleep with various celebrities the more atrocious the better they used to be interested in kissing and courting but now sexual behaviour seems to have turned a corner and for some a night out is nothing if they dont get straight down to copulation raw sex and instant gratification its the sexual version of a take away
7181770 we tolerate a culture that seems to teach girls the most noteworthy attribute they can have about sexiness
7181771 the problem now is that the sexualizing is aimed towards younger and younger girls then theres this idea that young girls who act like the worst kind of men sexually are liberated the idea that its empowering to just go out and have sex like a man without emotion or a relationship that sex is just another activity that kind of attitude popularised by shows like sex and the city has done a good deal to instill that idea in young girls they dont have the life experience to realise these shows are frothy fairy tales theyre not the way life works you cant just go round having sex with dozens of men you pick up at parties and not having it affect you in some way but how can we as parents help our teenage daughters develop a healthy attitude to sex according to the experts i interviewed for my book there are three very simple things you can do
7181772 first give girls a positive vision of what theyre waiting for
7181773 finally offer support it might be through your family from a source like a church group or even better through their friends greater censorship is not necessarily the answer this isnt about what adults do in their own homes or choose to see but we should be able to come to an agreement that the right of adults to see advertisements for topless bars for example should be exercised in a more private setting many people have been relieved that someone is at last voicing these objections people are led to believe that if they object to offensive content they are the ones who are hopelessly old fashioned and out of step

7181777 w hrend es gerade mal ein deutsches fabrikat unter die top ten schafft dominieren neun pkw aus deutschland klar die umweltbesten kompaktautos
7181778 die aktuelle vcd auto umweltliste zeigt dass viele fahrzeuge auf dem markt sind die einen akzeptablen verbrauch haben und bei l rm und schadstoffen gut abschneiden autok ufer haben also die wahl wenn sie umweltschonend und sparsam unterwegs sein wollen
7181779 wir hatten das fahrzeug in unser umweltranking aufgenommen weil uns die daimler ag verbindlich zugesichert hatte dass der diesel smart ab oktober endlich serienm ig mit einem geschlossenen partikelfilter gegen krankmachenden dieselru ausgeliefert wird
7181780 diese mogelpackung entspricht nicht dem stand der technik und unterl uft den notwendigen schutz der gesundheit insbesondere in ballungsgebieten niemand sollte den diesel smart ohne vollwertigen partikelfilter kaufen

7181804 hillary clinton has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7181805 its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad

7181819 the athletes have had so much amazing success here and there were some superb performances and its a huge honour and im very proud to be able to carry the flag on behalf of the entire team canada in the closing ceremonies tonight
7181820 we have to build our programs with a vision of success into the future not bask in the glory that sits here today but recognize we have to continue to get better and better and build as we move forward
7181821 weve done some quick math i like the number my financial officer does not
7181822 when sylvie bernier canadas chef de mission called me to tell me the news i was shocked and excited and ive been smiling all day and for me this will probably be my last olympic games so carrying the flag tonight will be a wonderful experience but a little emotional for me as well
7181823 i think its just a great way to end these olympics which have been so amazing
7181824 we like our blogging buddies we like them very much
7181825 it is no surprise that sen obama chose sen biden today to be his running mate in this presidential election
7181826 sen bidens choice highlights obamas lack of experience his lack of any foreign policy credentials and need to be seen as a candidate who can be trusted on national security
7181827 sen biden himself has agreed with john mccain that obama is not ready to lead
7181828 he stated in an interview regarding obamas readiness to be president that i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7181829 yes indeed four years ago i respectfully urged the government to increase its effort because this was something very important
7181830 i think this scheme of own the podium program is a very good one for obvious reasons there is a bigger drive for winter sports than summer sports in canada because of the climate and the geography
7181831 i think i should commend the government for what it has done but also the regional governments many provinces have been supportive
7181832 is this enough its up to the canadians to tell not for me im happy to see theres been a positive change but youll have to quantify it yourself i dont believe it will be short term i really believe its going to be in the long term
7181833 i take it with a big smile i was giving him what i think is fatherly advice and i stand by it
7181834 hes a 22 year old and its time to mature and show respect for his opponents
7181835 we heard allegations about the ages we took that very seriously we asked the international federation to open up an inquiry themselves eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the international federations not the ioc but of course we consider this as being a very serious issue
7181836 yes they will or you will kick them all out
7181837 alice kryzan has been an outstanding advocate for open space preservation clean water clean energy and environmental justice in western new york
7181838 were proud to throw our full support behind her candidacy and we strongly urge voters who care about new yorks environment to make her the next congress member from the 26th district
7181839 the fact that i was insulted is not the problem here the problem is your insinuation that non religious people have nothing to contribute to a forum on morality and the public good if youre not apologizing for claiming that non religious americans are amoral and unconcerned with the general welfare then you havent yet apologized
7181840 you havent apologized yet you gave us an argument claiming that it is perfectly legitimate to call non religious americans amoral and unconcerned with the general welfare because inset reasons the speaker used here youre not apologizing for calling non religious americans amoral youre trying to justify it but there is no justification for that kind of bigotry insert counter arguments to the speakers attempt at justification here
7181841 we are experiencing a rising tide of unemployment not seen in georgia in more than 15 years
7181842 the surge of jobless workers into our career centers is challenging our ability to keep pace with the demand for assistance at a time when it is most needed we ask our customers for their patience and cooperation as we work together to meet and overcome these economic challenges
7181843 since both banks serve contiguous markets along the gulf coast from the alabama state line to panama city and offer products and services that benefit similar customer needs it was a natural fit to combine their resources under one name
7181844 non performing assets should continue to increase but at a slower pace while net chargeoffs are unlikely to be materially different than the second quarter 2008 levels in the near future
7181845 he offers a balance to the ticket particularly in the area of experience sen obama exudes judgment sen biden brings a broad portfolio of national security and foreign affairs experience
7181846 as it narrowed to the last four or five people i was hoping it would be joe biden
7181847 in terms of government and the legislative branch his experience will certainly be an effective asset in an obama administration
7181848 were pretty sure its going to be tracking down the florida panhandle but once it gets right to the end of the panhandle into alabama the models vary but it looks like it could be turning north and catching the westerlies decreasing all this time of course and coming back through georgia maybe
7181849 either that or going more up to the north northeast and going into tennessee
7181850 youll get some of the northern brunt of it not too bad though because well have it over land so long it wont have hardly any punch just some good rain
7181851 im looking for a buyer who has the vision and most importantly in any housing project the resources to do a proper restoration of the house
7181852 its going to probably be somebody who loves the house who feels a passion for what could be restored to try and put it back to its ante bellum grandeur
7181853 i would assume he was a rather prosperous merchant in the civil war era
7181854 it was a lot different than it is today it was one of the most outstanding places in the community but that was 70 years ago
7181855 he didnt care about the house the house was incidental to that
7181856 thats one of the reasons i put it up for sale
7181857 its at a point where you dont want to have any more deterioration
7181858 i think the clutter actually protects the house because when people do enter its a bit of a deterrent to them moving around or causing any further real damage
7181859 i think people are looking for an explanation as to why is the house vacant
7181860 no its not haunted its just an old house that hasnt been lived in for many years its as simple as that
7181861 if there was a tunnel they would have had to bore that tunnel through solid dolomite
7181862 it would be a very small segment that were looking at that would be in a position to take something like this on
7181863 anything a full service financial institution can do we can do
7181864 he got the max so i feel very good about it
7181865 he hit the house and the garage about 10 or 11 times
7181866 its a tragic incident but the manslaughter was appropriate due to the lack of the intent to kill
7181867 the defendant basically lost it and kicked the victim in the abdomen
7181868 jenn and mason lampton the steeplechase founder have really really put a lot of thought into it
7181869 there will be hosts and hostesses helping people get things out of their cars including coolers and picnic baskets
7181870 there were two other people in the house with him
7181871 from blue ridge to atlanta from macon to valdosta thousands of unemployed georgians are pouring into our career centers
7181872 the georgia department of labor is committed to doing everything possible to assist them during these difficult economic times we ask for their patience and cooperation as we work together to overcome these unprecedented challenges

7181885 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said
7181886 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7181887 this proposal should never have been given serious consideration greenpeace climate campaigner john hepburn said
7181888 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland mr hepburn said
7181889 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change
7181890 i dont envy ms bligh given the economic power of the greenhouse mafia but sometime soon she is going to have to make the tough decision to put the future of the state ahead of the vested interests of the coal lobby
7181891 i tell them to go to complain to the government but the government doesnt help them
7181892 the government doesnt punish the people who hurt these women
7181893 looked at me with empathy i who had stanched her bleeding and cooled her fevers and greeted me in the language of my childhood as hamshira my sister
7181894 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
7181895 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
7181896 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
7181897 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
7181898 hell say he doesnt want to race that way like he always does
7181899 it wasnt much of a pass to me well see what hes got to say when he gets wrecked
7181900 well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7181901 i had to ask if hed do that to me and he has before
7181902 thats the way it goes we keep talking about rivalries we might have one now too bad we tore up the car after the race i guess he wasnt happy about it
7181903 its racing we cant give up points when theyre there to take
7181904 i like my spotter he is a good guy but man thats ridiculous
7181905 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i heard clear clear clear went up and there was still someone there i am pretty upset about it there were a lot of people that got involved in that which shouldnt have been involved at all because it shouldnt have happened
7181906 michael waltrip is the worst driver in nascar period i cant believe napa signed back on
7181907 its a shame that we got caught in that mess we had a really good car
7181908 thats the risk you run at bristol i love racing here its a great place with great fans its just a bad race for us
7181909 some guys got together in front of me and the guy behind me didnt get checked up and drilled me you need to look past your hood you look in front you tend not to hit stuff i was trying to be smart and really cautious and it didnt do me any good i got wrecked anyway
7181910 its a typical bristol wreck wrong place wrong time but im happy with the way the car ran
7181911 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7181912 i pushed and pushed i had to to tire the others
7181913 my plan was to push my body to the limits
7181914 there was obviously a lot of negativity leading up to the competition
7181915 but everyone knew that once the games actually started that would disappear and the success of the teams and the athletes would take over
7181916 its the second biggest expense we have behind labor costs
7181917 for us probably 8 or 10 percent of our gross receipts go to health insurance
7181918 neither one of them sounds like anything i want to sign up for
7181919 we had a couple of guys who had heart attacks and our rates went through the roof
7181920 and unfortunately when they died the rates went back down
7181921 for the kind of work we have we have to keep a top notch employee base as part of that you have to give them good insurance and good benefits and thats just getting tougher and tougher
7181922 i looked at him and the feeling i had was that i was looking at the future
7181923 she clinton has told us to put our full support behind senator obama and begin to move on
7181924 i dont think the democratic party needs a floor fight
7181925 i think the fact that our governor showed that he had juice in the clinton campaign i think hell be courted to make sure that same juice will be delivered for obama
7181926 i was among the grassroots group out of columbus that helped get barack on the ballot to be able to go to the convention is like just wow
7181927 this is the first time i think ive really wanted to be a delegate because i knew this was going to be a historic moment and i wanted to be part of that history
7181928 if i was to get a family plan for medical where i work were looking at almost 800 a month i spend that much on after school care for my daughters
7181929 so we just decided that except for the medical issues i had we could probably get by for three or four months without worrying too much
7181930 will do everything in their power and spend millions of dollars to lobby against it
7181931 unless he does what he talks about in uniting the masses of public opinion and creating social change somehow to get the american people to say im tired of it and im not going to take it anymore
7181932 when you are committed to reducing your impact on the environment tap water is the smart alternative to bottled water and daytons water quality makes it an easy choice
7181933 water is a driver to the health and vitality of any community dayton is blessed with an abundance
7181934 daytons drinking water consistently meets state and federal water quality standards and is tested 24 hours per day for purity
7181935 under the proposed amendment the meeting can be canceled in advance
7181936 when i left 27 years ago ohio was on top
7181937 we didnt make the adjustment as others did to a new knowledge economy driven by something else
7181938 we wanted to align with the state plan but make sure we were doing the right things for the region
7181939 all the numbers you look at were well behind the rest of the nation we rank 40th in the nation in the population over the age of 25 that have baccalaureate degrees
7181940 in a global society a global knowledge economy where the currency of this economy is talent you cant compete
7181941 weve worked very hard to be an affordable institution because 40 percent of our students come from families of incomes of less than 50 000
7181942 in our new strategic plan were going to spend a lot of our strategies on how do we make sure these students succeed
7181943 that is an increase of about 150 percent over the last six years
7181944 help grow the economy as we take innovation to market
7181945 were creating that because we need to get a higher percentage of those research dollars that go through the air force research lab at wright patterson air force base staying right here
7181946 were really committed as we go into the future to align our capabilities with the needs of the region and to make sure that were helping to transform the region
7181947 the doctor sent her to a specialist and wanted her to have two mris
7181948 well that costs 5 000 and i dont have the money for it so here we are shes probably not going to get it unless we get medicaid
7181949 i found out many years later that the risk was greater with my special type of tumor for it to travel to the other side
7181950 if it did the tumor would mirror itself in the left breast
7181951 we are finding as breast surgeons that we now have been able to identify all different factors people have that tell us that lady is at an increased risk level for developing breast cancer
7181952 we look at such things as first degree relatives with breast cancer or if theres any genetic mutations
7181953 hopefully it will take away some of the fear factor and erase some of the concerns people have about their image
7181954 when they see a beautiful star having this done hopefully it will cause other ladies to really evaluate the advice they might be receiving
7181955 i felt like a part of me was being taken away part of my womanhood and femininity so to speak
7181956 but at the same time im grateful they were able to catch it when they did because otherwise i might not be here talking today
7181957 i think the democrats ought to continue to be overly optimistic about everything that happens this fall
7181958 well continue to do our job and the voters will decide on election day
7181959 we work so hard for candidates this is our one time to get together and have some fun
7181960 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7181961 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7181962 he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7181963 if the club sells one or two more players its not a problem for me
7181964 i dont know if some clubs want shaun in the last game he played 25 30 minutes and he has played for the second time in the first group of training
7181965 i dont know what the player is thinking about with regards offers from other teams if i have 24 25 players with me and three or four for every two positions then im happy i have three or four players in this wing right and wing left position
7181966 after 30 minutes we scored two goals and i was more relaxed
7181967 i think in my opinion we are not better than arsenal because they won and had three points we are not better than liverpool because they also won
7181968 we need now to win again against wigan and maybe arsenal or liverpool draw or lose then we are in the best position
7181969 i have hoped for a return for a while and yesterday i began to believe that this deal could end well
7181970 for me it is as if ive won the champions league
7181971 there were some complications but now that everything is resolved i am really happy
7181972 after a series of frantic phone calls during the day today we have reached an agreement with chelsea
7181973 andriy returns to the rossoneri tomorrow he will be in milan monday he will undergo a medical then he will sign a contract and from tuesday he will be available to carlo ancelotti
7181974 we succeeded in bringing home the player who in the last 50 years has scored the most goals in our shirt
7181975 president silvio berlusconi and i am happy as is our coach and i believe also our players
7181976 i believe that milan are the only club in the world to have three european players of the year in their squad
7181977 andriy has returned home and i am happy about it i am a milan fan and i am very happy
7181978 ive spoken to andriy 48 times in the past three hours the terms of the agreement are very private
7181979 between today and tomorrow andriy will be in milan and he will start again his life as a milan player
7181980 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home
7181981 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
7181982 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7181983 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7181984 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it
7181985 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7181986 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7181987 what would i be doing today if i only had 37 days to live
7181988 do unto others as you have them do unto you
7181989 if you can do it for 12 you can have the business
7181990 my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die

7181996 the church can exist without theological schools but theological schools cannot exist with the church
7181997 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7181998 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7181999 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7182000 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7182001 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7182002 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7182003 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7182004 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7182005 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7182006 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7182007 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7182008 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7182009 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7182010 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7182011 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7182012 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7182013 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7182014 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7182015 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7182016 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7182017 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7182018 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7182019 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7182020 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7182021 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7182022 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7182023 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7182024 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7182025 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7182026 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away

7182028 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7182029 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7182030 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7182031 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7182032 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7182033 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7182034 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7182035 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7182036 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7182037 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7182038 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7182039 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7182040 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7182041 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7182042 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7182043 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7182044 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7182045 this is a planning took where all things are going
7182046 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7182047 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7182048 the tra is pleased with the level of preparedness and seriousness of the interested parties
7182049 having considered the feedback the tra has made changes to the draft invitation document where necessary and is now publishing a report on the consultation as well as the final invitation to submit proposals for the provision of mobile tv transmission service in the uae
7182050 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7182051 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7182052 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7182053 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7182054 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7182055 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7182056 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7182057 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7182058 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7182059 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7182060 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7182061 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7182062 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7182063 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7182064 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7182065 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7182066 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7182067 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7182068 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7182069 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7182070 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7182071 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7182072 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7182073 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7182074 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7182075 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7182076 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7182077 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7182078 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7182079 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7182080 a driving licence will be issued with one year validity and will be renewed twice for one year each time before a driver is given a 10 year validity licence
7182081 a new driver will have to sit for a driving test again or be sent to driving school for more training in case of serious traffic offences such as jumping red signals causing serious accidents or accumulating black points as result of other violations
7182082 the aim is to monitor drivers reduce road accidents and improve the driving culture especially rash and careless driving among new and young ones posing dangers to road users
7182083 we are also introducing driving manuals for learner drivers trainers and examiners by the end of this year or early next year
7182084 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7182085 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7182086 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7182087 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7182088 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7182089 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7182090 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7182091 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7182092 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7182093 theres no doubt when you look back at the season theres disappointment because we could have been a lot higher than what we are
7182094 personally i think its disappointing when youre in front of richmond by close to five goals and when youre in front by six goals at three quarter time theyre the two games youve definitely got to chalk in as wins
7182095 its got to go down as a team effort in the good times and the bad times
7182096 we all contributed to our downfall as we all contributed to probably our best quarter of the season in the third quarter
7182097 you obviously want to finish the season strongly you certainly want to feel better about yourself
7182098 and sydneys had the wood over us so it would be nice to end the season with a win
7182099 sydney have struggled for the last few weeks so weve got to go down there and really take them on and test our bodies to see if we have matured against them because theyve manhandled us a bit in the last few years
7182100 i want to get out there and lead the side and make sure we train hard this week and not sulk around the place set the right example
7182101 en seguida ver usted como puedo deslizarme hasta la puerta

7182103 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7182104 in his very first appearance as the vice presidential candidate biden demonstrated that hes more than willing to play the traditional role of attack dog
7182105 he recited a litany of what many democrats feel is wrong with the current administration and linked his friend john mccain to them in doing so biden proved himself an able fighter in his initial outing
7182106 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7182107 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7182108 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7182109 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7182110 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7182111 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7182112 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7182113 johnny is an out and out goalscorer as well we could change our shape a bit
7182114 i think we need to be versatile you look at different teams and you play them different ways
7182115 and when johnny comes back and poppa captain and centre back tony popovic comes back and forward brendan santalab well have a bit more speed because santa is lighting quick
7182116 it just gives us different options and we need to play different ways against different opposition
7182117 it was fantastic the one touch football we played and little angles and triangles we created in the first half in particular it was great to watch it was fun on the sideline to be honest
7182118 giving them two easy goals but then coming back was great
7182119 and then to lose it with a free kick like that was hard to take because i thought we were dominating the game at that time
7182120 well wait for the scan but on the appearance of the elbow last night i cant see him getting back this year
7182121 i hope we get a huge crowd because he absolutely deserves that
7182122 i was at the club when he came along as a little skinny 17 year old from taree and hes given us tremendous service as well as nsw and australia and hes been a model citizen off the field as well
7182123 so he deserves a big send off and i hope the people give him that
7182124 thats one thing about danny buderus he was probably a bit unlucky that he played his career at a time when andrew johns was playing
7182125 because at any other time and any other player other than andrew johns danny would have gone down in history as our best player
7182126 modern dance is supposed to play with the idea of free association of body movements and break the rules of traditional aesthetic styles

7182147 ive been taking photos since i was a little girl ive always loved nature
7182148 everything in nature astounds me i believe things created by god are so beautiful
7182149 i think i see in nature things other people dont see its part of the gift of being an artist
7182150 it was the first thing that really clicked for me i like the scientific aspect of it
7182151 i think it fits me fine some people have to be creating all the time im the sort that has to mull things over
7182152 dolls are kind of freaky because they have all these wires and gears ive tried plates and forks and rocks but theres nothing inside them road kill can be interesting
7182153 the beautiful patterns that natural subjects often reveal under the tube make me feel that in the end we dont really create
7182154 we only discover how to see the beauty that is already there

7182162 he will never leave you you keep asking him questions and expect an answer but every answer he gives you you dont like how can you expect him to leave you alone if youre always asking for help and asking questions
7182163 then if god is there then why doesnt it seem like it
7182164 he is there he is always there you just need to listen
7182165 why cant i hear him as loud as i hear satan
7182166 satan will fight to keep another soul from entering the kingdom of heaven the bible says to draw near to him and he will draw near to you
7182167 i dont understand why if jesus is my shepherd and i am his sheep why is he not rescuing me
7182168 you call his name but you dont turn around to look for him

7182208 every day i do five things that may result in business some days i do more but i always do at least 5 no matter how busy i am and i have been doing this same daily routine for 20 years why does this work several reasons first i hustle and stay hungry every day by putting my mind on business development second business development is work so it has to be planned into your daily schedule like all work third business development is a skill the more you do the better you get finally following this rule means that i do 30 actions a week for 50 weeks this amounts to 1500 actions a year and i know that this is a lot more than the typical professional does what you see now in my practices is the result of doing this for twenty years and simply doing 30 000 things over the years to build a successful practice
7182209 we are all going where you went its just you were called earlier than us

7182211 the formation of cabo pulmo marine park has been a huge success
7182212 one of the main bugaboos in this debate and one that analysts says is increasingly cropping up as an issue for male lawyers as well is the billable hours regime
7182213 i see a lot of people who are distressed about where the profession has gone
7182214 mr boone the dallas lawyer says that his 425 member firm has 38 female partners about 25 percent of the firms overall partnership base he intends for that percentage to increase adding that one thing that attracts a diverse group of lawyers to his firm is its compensation practices lawyers at haynes and boone are rewarded for teamwork not individual accomplishments staving off the dog eat dog competition for clients and assignments that pervades many firms compensation is also based on a number of other factors including leadership and business development activities among which billable hours are just one component
7182215 musharraf is a brave man and has his origins in india
7182216 based on working with thousands of professionals at top firms over the years i believe that many women are just naturally better at listening empathizing with clients and asking insightful questions when they harness these strengths their selling performance goes way up i found that the best women rainmakers are the best client diagnosticians listeners and relationship stewards
7182217 i think the chief concern is the tradeoff between lost privacy and what you gain in terms of public safety
7182218 this is just one more drop in the bucket in some ways but its also a drop that we have some local control over
7182219 the public misconception is that theyre out there for us to keep tabs on the residents and thats not the case
7182220 in reality if theyre up there and theyre operational 24 hours a day
7182221 well reap some of the other benefits from them as well
7182222 you dont have to let crime occur and when you find out a crime has occurred later go back and research the tapes

7182267 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7182268 you learn about a man when you debate with him you see how he thinks barack obama has the vision and courage to make this a better place he is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done

7182280 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7182281 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7182282 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7182283 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said
7182284 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7182285 this proposal should never have been given serious consideration greenpeace climate campaigner john hepburn said
7182286 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland mr hepburn said
7182287 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change
7182288 i dont envy ms bligh given the economic power of the greenhouse mafia but sometime soon she is going to have to make the tough decision to put the future of the state ahead of the vested interests of the coal lobby
7182289 i would like to thank all those who have offered their love and support

7182299 we can do this very efficiently and at the same time we can help to ensure that pensioners are not hurt by anti terrorism investment policies
7182300 im very much someone who believes we are all somewhat social investors no one wants to invest in companies with bad practices
7182301 when you really look at the treasurers office its really important
7182302 is basically the chief financial officer for the state of pennsylvania with a multi billion dollar budget annually that has to be managed
7182303 in a state as large as pennsylvania with a budget as large as pennsylvanias over 28 billion having someone whos qualified and capable in that office is important
7182304 i think for most treasurers the odds are with them running again but im not someone who needs to hold public office thats not what ive organized my life around
7182305 i think you go serve your time in government and then go back to the private world
7182306 id like to do eight years as treasurer and go back and practice law some more
7182307 the violence in anbar has gone down despite the surge not because of the surge

7182314 of course its getting harder and harder but we want to have hope

7182317 las dos mayores decepciones han sido paquillo y mario pestano dos atletas de los que se esperaba una medalla y que potencialmente la val an al d a siguiente paquillo no se explicaba lo que le hab a pasado se qued sin fuerzas mario tuvo las medallas a su alcance tuvo mala suerte porque por un cent metro no pas a la mejora y con tres tiros m s nunca se sabe pero ten a que haber estado ah desde el principio

7182320 hasta los europeos de barcelona 2010 muchos van a aguantar

7182324 en los primeros 5 kil metros me he encontrado muy bien pero estaba deseando ver en qu momento dejaban de ir en sexta y met an la cuarta para reducir y no contaminar pero no hab a forma
7182325 la temperatura no ha sido determinante que era yo quer a porque sab a que en condiciones normales esta gente es mejor que nosotros y es muy dif cil al ritmo que han salido no tenemos posibilidades de nada lo he intentado y cuando uno intenta y da todo lo que tiene y pelea no se le puede pedir m s
7182326 en los primeros 10 kil metros he quemado muchas naves y del 10 al 15 que quemado a n m s de lo que ten a que haber hecho

7182333 its about community its everyones stadium this is the peoples stadium
7182334 weve had trouble making ends meet here because of key expenses like insurance and real estate taxes our cook county real estate taxes have been going up 50 to 100 percent per year and that played a big part in our decision to sell
7182335 sales have not gone up 50 to 100 percent per year so something had to give we are sad to be leaving but when you are in business you have to make business decisions

7182637 i dont think people realize what it is to not make a team and then to try to make the next team the real willpower that it takes to hang onto that dream
7182638 i think you have to ask a lot of questions how important is it what kind of financial support are you going to have an olympic medal yeah its going to help you get ahead in life but its not going to secure the rest of your life
7182639 i want my apartment i want to go to school i want transportation
7182640 i want these things and im capable of getting them
7182641 the day i got my passport felt like a birthday
7182642 it will be over and then who is tad after that i think hes wrestling with that
7182643 they asked me if id like to come to one of their games
7182644 i know its not a date but that made me feel good
7182645 someone told me the colts have won one preseason game in the last four years the preseason has no direct correlation to this season the goal is to improve as a team
7182646 theyre not all roy williams and ricky williams not everybody is casey hampton and shaun rogers everybody thinks weve got 44 of them weve got really good players who play hard and we have to put them in the right places and feature what they do best
7182647 but we dont have as many great players as people think we do
7182648 weve just got to dissect everything figure out whats going on go to work thats the only thing you can do
7182649 we were mad about different things in 2007 that were going on it still bothers me weve got to go out there and sign our name to something make a statement early on set our reputation for the year
7182650 they havent even had a test yet theyre still studying
7182651 its like theyve got their tutors their coach and theyre building up to it but now its time to play and put it out there and find out who we are
7182652 everybody talks about who they are in preseason nobody really knows unless youve got 20 starters back from last year or something and you still dont know how theyre going to react but you at least have seen them before
7182653 hopefully because of colt coming back well have a little bit of a handle in terms of what well be able to do
7182654 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
7182655 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home

7182688 we came out with a new attitude tonight men and women
7182689 its just special its a group effort and its totally different from an individual thing its a blessing to end on this note
7182690 its hard after working for four years and coming up short i dont think that memory will go away overnight i think about it a lot but at least now i have something positive to think about as well
7182691 we had a meeting this afternoon we didnt talk about what people thought we talked about things that were going on in america we talked about people sitting around their tv watching we wanted to give them a shot of something so they would really get up in the morning and keep it going
7182692 i think they understood the importance of the moment to represent
7182693 we had confidence in sanya that she would be able to bring it home strong
7182694 when i saw the russian team ahead of us i was like finally i have a chance to chase and really have fun it really pumped me up to have a little challenge was exciting
7182695 shes one of the best competitors and i guess she was kind of mad at the bronze medal so she was ready to go
7182696 its an incredible team probably the strongest team that weve ever sent to the olympics
7182697 i am not proud that we werent in the finals i have lived my entire life to be in that race we werent there i cant change that but it shouldnt have a reflection on how this mens team performed
7182698 somebody somewhere has got a voodoo doll of the u s
7182699 these are professional athletes who are the best in their field and anybody who ever ran a high school relay cringes when that baton hits the track
7182700 it reminds me of nba players who have horrendous free throw percentages all it takes is repetition preparation and focus to make a free throw the same goes for baton passing

7182702 digg top 100 is an incredibly large feat for some people
7182703 youre a top submitter how are you getting that data
7182704 and slashdot is still a viable alternative if the layout doesnt give you a migraine
7182705 but when the site becomes so stale that breaking news stories dont hit the front page despite huge digg counts until 20 22 hours after theyre submitted it turns the site into something else entirely
7182706 my suggestion for digg is to drop the algorithm penalties and to eliminate ways for the
7182707 top 100 is an elite list that is extremely competitive
7182708 i think this quest for fame and the top users list has an effect on about 200 people
7182709 if a story is submitted and the digg community thinks it is interesting enough it will get to the homepage
7182710 if you ask the people whose submissions are making it there they would obviously say that the quality is increasing
7182711 just because you arent finding the same value as before doesnt inherently mean that the quality went down when digg first began it was mainly tech focused so when it expanded the quality went down for some people but it increased for others
7182712 i mean really why do stories like this get frontpaged
7182713 if a story is submitted and the digg community thinks it is interesting enough it will get to the homepage
7182714 but there are people who feel its a lot more than that
7182715 you cant tell me that anyone can go out and start an account submit something that is front page worthy and have it magically get there because they community will see the value in it
7182716 perhaps those people can just not visit the 3rd party top users list problem solved
7182717 imo removing the stats will have a minuscule effect on digg
7182718 you kind of need to be it to believe it
7182719 oh are you in the top 100 yet you should be
7182720 however if you have ever payed attention to seo spam scraper programs or any other automated content grabbers etc all this information can be assimilated without an api or publicly available stats
7182721 he was a mild prince if one should undertake to judge him from the time of his principate but when he shared the state with others he wielded the sword when he was at your present age nero having just passed his eighteenth year he had already buried his dagger in the bosom of friends he had already in stealth aimed a blow at the side of the consul mark antony he had already been a partner in proscription
7182722 octavius was of two minds about the project but suetonius writes once the proscription had been decided on
7182723 augustus is one of the few historical figures who improved with the passage of time he began as a bloodthirsty adventurer but once he had achieved power he made a respectable man of himself he repealed his illegal acts and took trouble to govern fairly and efficiently
7182724 vedius ordered him to be seized and doomed him to die
7182725 but in an extraordinary way he ordered him to be thrown to the huge lampreys the lad slipped from his captors and fled to caesars feet begging only that he might die some other way anything but being eaten caesar shocked by such an innovation in cruelty ordered that the boy be pardoned and besides that all the crystal cups be broken before his eyes and that the fish pond be filled up
7182726 we can join many past generations in gratitude to augustus for giving us this poem

7182732 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7182733 insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible

7182735 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7182736 obama recognized the gap on national security and he recognized the need to get tougher on mccain and he chose the guy who can most quickly help him on both counts
7182737 there should be no doubt that this is going to be a rough campaign from here on out and biden knows how to fight im sure that was a strong consideration
7182738 this is an admission by barack obama that he doesnt have the experience to be president more than a vice president hes looking for a hand holder or a tutor

7182747 reader category in that they consume and vote on the content that is being put forward by the media hubs again i think being a media hub is just a part of a persons being social media marketing is a few things
7182748 social media being a vague term that indicates any feature or function that allows other people to participate with any given site almost everyone is technically engaged in social media and people that use it at even a basic level for some conversion or gain often refer to themselves as social media marketers

7182754 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well

7182761 they want to continue their racial holy war against the poor it pays such great dividends these days
7182762 mccain is pro life and that of course means pro war pro life means the worship of the holy sanctified fetus and the death of the unholy unsanctified fetus
7182763 i predicted it obamas vote to kill babies born alive after partial birth abortion is the thing republicans have up their sleeve michelle obama was the fund raiser that made it possible and they have her on tape defending womens right to kill their babies who refuse to die from having their brains sucked out
7182764 michelle obama is on tape defending sucking the brains out of babies who live through late term abortions
7182765 i do not know brangelina and do not mean to personally impugn sic them as they might be good people in the flesh but the medias images of them are smelly and vile

7182771 im very sorry about that im sure hell love whatever it was it looked just the sort of thing he likes
7182772 thats okay i remember what i was like at that age
7182773 if youre 50 years old or younger give every book about 50 pages before you decide to commit yourself to reading it or give it up if youre over 50 which is when time gets shorter subtract your age from 100 the result is the number of pages you should read before deciding whether or not to quit if youre 100 or over you get to judge the book by its cover despite the dangers in doing so
7182774 be strong and of good courage do not be afraid nor be dismayed for the lord your god is with you wherever you go

7182794 now there was a famine in the land so abram went down to egypt
7182795 i think im one of the lucky few in that i have no regrets
7182796 i actually reached a stage in my life where i was proud of what id achieved and at the end of the day ive found something i love just as much if not more and it requires no physical pain on a daily basis
7182797 i absolutely love it for me melbournes greatest attraction is its people they love sport theyre so supportive of it i mean in what other city in the world can it be 15 degrees and pouring with rain and youll still have 50 000 people turn up for a football game theyre so passionate about sport yet the same people who go to the football will go to the theatre theyll try anything once and embrace everything life has to offer they love their food and their art theyre all rounders
7182798 im one of those people who loves being settled as much as i enjoy travelling i think your home is the most important thing a place thats completely yours and where you feel comfortable being who you want to be
7182799 im probably recognised more in my trackies when im trying to be inconspicuous than when im trying to be glam
7182800 im not sure how he lost his leg he was an eight week old puppy who had lost it about a week and a half before i got him it was love at first sight he was already named and i thought he had enough issues to deal with so i didnt change it
7182801 i worry about how much exercise hed need if he had four legs
7182802 i find this hilarious i have so much more energy now than i ever did when i was at peak physical fitness and my health is so much better now than it was then
7182803 yep exactly i guess when youre in the thick of it youre always pushing that boundary in over exercising and doing enough work for your sport i think the best remedy for anyone whos struggling to do some exercise is to get a dog because they dont care if its raining rain hail or shine they dont care if youve had a bad day they need a walk
7182804 i think there are a few swimmers there who love training too much grant hackett may be one of them the machine that is grant hackett but for most of us we love racing and competing and we cant do one without the other
7182805 if you ask a swimmer what theyd love to take out of the sport more than anything theyll say an olympic gold medal thats the epitome of success in our sport you can never take that away from me i can be 100 other things but i will always be an olympic gold medalist
7182806 i reached a point where i was almost like if i die tomorrow i cant think of anything worse than if the only thing people could say about me was that i could swim
7182807 i felt it was time for the next journey time for the next chapter and there were so many other facets of myself that i was ready to explore which you just dont have the chance to do when youre a full time athlete
7182808 im not a morning person i definitely needed a nanna nap doing the weather
7182809 i dont know how beautiful stevie jacobs does it year in year out its a tough one
7182810 i wouldnt change much if i could i do a little bit of everything coming from the monotony of swimming where every day is the same as the day before i needed something quite varied and mixed up each day is different which is exactly what i want and i couldnt be happier
7182811 simon cowley has been a very good friend for years hes the most placid non confrontational non aggressive person ive ever met i know there are two sides to every story but i cant see simon ever being involved in something that would warrant action

7182813 south africans are a proud nation they want to be winners they want to back a winning side
7182814 one big message that we want to get out there is that we will never go out and lose a game on purpose
7182815 rome wasnt built in one day so i think we should be patient as the players should be more patient on the team
7182816 i would ask that the public still give us some time
7182817 the laws have changed you look at how we were caught fast asleep in the first half of the super 14 by not changing quick enough to the laws
7182818 i believe that we are on the right track and the players do believe it
7182819 its just that they have to get used to it and we will get used to it
7182820 yes we believe in it and i think we worked hard this whole week on exactly what we want to do on the field
7182821 its just about execution the chances are there but were making too many mistakes for international players thats unacceptable
7182822 were the springboks were the world champs and we lost two games in a row
7182823 i think if you go to the change room and you look at the players theyd be feeling worse than the crowd out there
7182824 its our jobs its our work its our passion its our lives and its unacceptable for us to play like that

7182832 i try to practice 5 or 6 hours a day
7182833 i played in about 12 juniors events this summer im more consistent im hitting a lot more greens and fairways im scoring better
7182834 i was happy with my finish at state last year but im really hoping that i can continue improving
7182835 a top five finish would be my ultimate goal for this season because ive been working really hard on my game
7182836 one of the reasons i play in tournaments over the summer is so i can keep the same mindset i have during the school season it ends up helping me a lot during our first few meets
7182837 my dad always played a lot of golf and my mom started playing around the time my brother and i did
7182838 golf is definitely a lifelong sport that my entire family loves
7182839 my brother and i got the chance to play four or five times a week over the summer sometimes with other friends
7182840 its a lot of fun to see the freshmen coming in this year
7182841 i think that we have a really solid team and im so proud of everyone because theyve worked so hard
7182842 he works with all of us individually but also as a team and thats what makes him such a good coach
7182843 he also helps me with the mental side of the game hes definitely one of the reasons ive played so well
7182844 if i get the opportunity to play golf in college i will definitely take it
7182845 hopefully it would be a school that has great academics because thats what im looking for as well
7182846 it was kind of weird because he had never texted before
7182847 they all have to do with competing and becoming better
7182848 i knew he had it in him but a score like that is not something you think about
7182849 i told him great job dont talk to me on the back nine
7182850 my parents were watching and i remember my mom started laughing because she couldnt believe i was making so many putts
7182851 i made the changes because i wanted to get to the next level
7182852 im hoping all the work i put in this year will pay off
7182853 i like that everything that happens is because of what i do
7182854 hes always been a mature kid and you see the leadership qualities come out from year to year
7182855 hes a sharp kid who knows what he wants to do in life
7182856 crippled reproductively by the pesticide ddt peregrine falcons stopped nesting in pennsylvania in the late 1950s
7182857 with the banning of ddt in the early 70s and reintroduction efforts in several northeastern states including pennsylvania through the 80s and 90s peregrines slowly began to reclaim their nesting range throughout the northeast
7182858 we have a lot of work to do between now and october
7182859 it will be a pretty typical year in the dvc very competitive
7182860 i expect them the three returning players to be pretty consistent
7182861 i have no idea who our fourth score is going to be
7182862 i think you are probably going to be looking at neuqua valley and st charles east to be at the top in the league
7182863 maybe well put a little pressure on hinsdale central well see
7182864 anyone can beat anyone on their home course in our league
7182865 andy wethekam has worked hard on his game and its great to him progress hes one of the best players in the state as usual the west suburban silver is a very competitive conference were definitely going to battle
7182866 there are five or six guys behind them the three returnees who on any given day can throw in a low score
7182867 the good competition we play will propel us for the invites and state tournament
7182868 there are plenty of wonderful streams throughout the state but more often than not theyre not easy to find or not suitable for easy access
7182869 experienced canoers may get used to the difficulties in getting to the water but less experienced people may find it frustrating
7182870 we dont want to make it too easy we want access to be rustic and natural but we dont want people to fall down the hill getting on the water
7182871 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7182872 insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible
7182873 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7182874 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7182875 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7182876 it got a little crusty and the wind picked up a little bit but i didnt do very well
7182877 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7182878 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have imagined
7182879 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger
7182880 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7182881 i tried to hit a little 64 degree wedge and it came out and i heard it ding my club on the follow through
7182882 we had ups and we had downs just wanted to end on a high moment
7182883 it doesnt make up for it but its a start to the healing process
7182884 we won more medals it just didnt come from where everyone else thought it should come
7182885 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7182886 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7182887 the boys ran a good race they ran a tough race bekele took charge
7182888 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7182889 my medal count goal is that at the end of the day when 91 000 people leave that stadium
7182890 theyve heard our national anthem so many times that theyre humming it on their way out the door
7182891 as the us financial industry strengthens its anti money laundering programs the use of the hawala system to move illicit funds becomes increasingly attractive to terrorist and other criminal organisations
7182892 i think hes great if youre that good and he breezed through all the early stages and then turned it on for the finals its so impressive if you can do that
7182893 hes so talented and has got so much confidence its such a big stage and the whole world is watching so if you can perform like he has then you can gloat and its good to see
7182894 i will be 37 so im not sure i will still be playing but you never know at the end of day im just going to be happy to be involved
7182895 i will definitely be there but whether its playing or not im not so sure about that one
7182896 for me football is the best sport in the world so for me it should be top of the list
7182897 there are so many other great sports and so many other athletes who have worked so hard to get here but its still important
7182898 there are great players and great teams over here so its still my number one sport whether or not it is looked at as different
7182899 the bolt issue i take with a big smile i gave him what i believe to be fatherly advice
7182900 i stand by what i said he was the icon of the games together with michael phelps and i have great respect for his abilities
7182901 if liverpool keeps on playing like they did against sunderland and boro
7182902 that wall has got to be high that wall has got to be strong he said
7182903 when people come to attack you theyre looking for weakness
7182904 one of our coaches came up before camp started and said all the work weve done in the summer youve just prepared yourself to do well this season we had to come out and have a good camp to be able to do well this season
7182905 we really want to show people what were all about this year junior defensive end erik lorig said
7182906 i think everyones thinking about that this is definitely one of those top feelings i must say above all else that ive had here in terms of our team i think its the first time a lot of people are able to admit that everyone has the same bond coming out of camp
7182907 he was doing a marvelous job harbaugh said of owusu
7182908 he doesnt say anything about his team i dont see anything about our team
7182909 there has been a lot of surprises from the young guys stepping up and learning the system a little quicker than we thought to having all three quarterbacks play at a high level he said
7182910 p0rr4 s vio que m3rd4 put4 que o pariu v tomar no 6u
7182911 im just doing the same thing focusing on getting better and improving and focusing on doing whatever the team needs to win
7182912 im preparing the same way preparing to play the best you can nothing changes youre trying to go out there and win the game no matter whos playing it doesnt matter i came out focused on getting better thats all you can do
7182913 every day is about development and doing what you can to improve as a player
7182914 if you go out there and try to improve as a player it makes the team better and goal of winning games better
7182915 i did everything theyve asked me to do i have a 3
7182916 nothing is going to be given to me i have to go out there and get it
7182917 hopefully it wont be long until im back it was still a little tight and a little sore before i got it worked on but it feels good now it doesnt look like its anything serious
7182918 it was really weird ive never had anything like that before
7182919 i went for a walk with my daughter and wife i had my sunglasses on and i kept taking them off and rubbing them because it was like they had a smear when i got to the field it was real bad it felt like i had a film on my eye but i woke up saturday and it was fine
7182920 chris is better than he was last year and i think coye is going to do a great job for us tomey said they have a lot of work to do to become a better tandem than owens and lowery but the potential is there
7182921 i dont see it as pressure francies said of replacing lowery
7182922 its not a challenge i look at it as an opportunity im anxious to show just how good we are
7182923 the last time i took off a helmet isnt going to be in an ambulance zusin said after practice friday
7182924 it was scary when i was just laying there couldnt feel anything couldnt move anything zusin said
7182925 i thought it was over what do i do now
7182926 there is still a pretty good amount of pain just walking around or even standing
7182927 we ran into the house and got her out of the house she was stuck in the kitchen
7182928 if he wouldnt have seen the smoke then we wouldnt went in there and she would have probably died
7182929 i tried to get in the back but the back had all the fire coming down but i didnt want the house to come down so i told everyone to get out of the house

7182933 the human factor nelson mandela and the game that changed the world
7182934 this victory will help the young players to the national side
7182935 seven or eight players on this team will play in the 2010 world cup
7182936 as long as we keep winning its better for the coaches because they have more options when putting together a roster
7182937 they played so hard tonight for me they won the gold medal in this game
7182938 im very happy after all i had to overcome to be able to play here
7182939 a lot of us also play for the full national team so now we are aiming to win the world cup

7182981 im just doing the same thing focusing on getting better and improving and focusing on doing whatever the team needs to win
7182982 im preparing the same way preparing to play the best you can nothing changes youre trying to go out there and win the game no matter whos playing it doesnt matter i came out focused on getting better thats all you can do
7182983 every day is about development and doing what you can to improve as a player
7182984 if you go out there and try to improve as a player it makes the team better and goal of winning games better
7182985 i did everything theyve asked me to do i have a 3
7182986 nothing is going to be given to me i have to go out there and get it
7182987 yes mommy im tired not thirsty tired i need a nap
7182988 no mommy i need to lay down and take a nap
7182989 post slush suddenly theres a new interest in extending term limits
7182990 wcze niej czy p niej dojdzie do tego aktu mi o ci do zwierz t kt re w biblii nazywane s stworzeniami bo ymi

7182992 im trying to keep volquez close to the cy even though its an outside shot
7182993 i want him to keep that cy in sight he says its no big deal but its a big deal for me because it would be a big deal for him
7182994 bako has been doing a good job with the kids and especially the way those kids have been throwing to him
7182995 and cueto has been throwing outstanding too with bako so bako will get tonight and tomorrow with cueto and well give the kid rookie ryan hanigan a couple in houston
7182996 oh yeah he gives a good target he is in the ballgame he calls a real good game and he studies you know
7182997 whoever our catcher is especially if it is hanigan bako would be like chicagos henry blanco hes made all the difference in the world helping rookie geovany soto thats down the line so well get that when we get there
7182998 i dont get mad they dont want to give up runs
7182999 lincoln needed to get a double play but couldnt and neither could masset he got it up too you cant mess with matt holliday with the bases loaded weve escaped it a couple of times but sooner or later he is gonna get you
7183000 these guys can hit and theyre dangerous in this ballpark
7183001 you try to stay away from the big inning but thats what got us in the eighth four runs
7183002 its tough to throw 40 pitches in the second inning thats a lot and you know that is going to come back to get you
7183003 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7183004 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7183005 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7183006 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7183007 there are always handfuls of guys who were born to hit and want to hit but i like to watch their intensity on defense and what they do when they get on the bases
7183008 vottos splits of hitting right and left are better right now than bruces but that takes time our brad hawpe was not good and this year he has having a breakthrough year against left handed pitchers
7183009 i notice both votto and bruce are aggressive hitters look to be confident hitters and seem to enjoy what they are doing
7183010 they both have age on their side and skills thats a great combination to have
7183011 he is one guy nobody has talked about hes a crafty lefty and is 14 5 this year
7183012 he won 15 last year actually 16 at class aaa nashville tenn and class aa huntsville ala i dont buy that about guys not having enough fastball its if they know how to win
7183013 you know todd frazier class a sarasota fla shortstop played on the toms river n j team that won the little league world series 1998
7183014 he has 12 homers but im thinking he might be too big 6 foot 3 215 pounds to play shortstop
7183015 but then i see colorado shortstop troy tulowitzki 6 3 205 and man that whole colorado infield is big
7183016 were looking forward to seeing what this team is this year
7183017 im more interested in the long run where has this program been beneficial to them did it help them to grow and mature as young men
7183018 you want to make me happy you have to do something real good with your life to have been a part of that thats where i get my joy football is just a vehicle
7183019 its probably been the hardest camp in all of the years that ive been here
7183020 the thing we really worked on was conditioning weve got a big hill over by our practice field we hit the hill hard
7183021 we have a great group of veterans that came back
7183022 we should be leading the team out there making plays and being aggressive just meeting those challenges the coaches have given us
7183023 democrats have not been this excited at a convention since 1992 when they nominated bill clinton
7183024 it energized our party weve now got a chance to win indiana all obama has to do is carry the same states that sen john kerry carried in 2004 and win illinois indiana and west virginia and he is the president
7183025 we will sit with the indiana delegation and see history made as the first african american is nominated for president
7183026 they will put her name on the ballot so the question is do we actually vote for her if it goes to a vote i vote for her what i imagine will happen is they will run the ballot up to new york and when it is time for her to vote she will withdraw her name and ask all of her delegates to go for barack obama
7183027 it is a foregone conclusion obama has the number of delegates to win
7183028 i was not a slated delegate i had to campaign for it
7183029 i see the convention as bringing everything to fruition letting the first viable female candidate be nominated from the floor on the first ballot letting her delegates vote for her which brings it all to a complete closure it is a great way to unite the party
7183030 i want to be out there educating myself to see how i can be more effective in making my candidate become elected
7183031 this economy has hit my family very hard there has to be a change
7183032 i anticipate shell release her delegates and ask them to back obama so it looks like a unified party
7183033 are at opposite ends of the political spectrum on a number of issues
7183034 it could change the social fabric of america on important social issues
7183035 iron man records stanley brinks tour and gig at the jug of ale moseley birmingham march 14th 2008
7183036 iron man records joe odonnells shkayla are booking a tour for 2008
7183037 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7183038 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7183039 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7183040 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7183041 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7183042 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7183043 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7183044 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7183045 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7183046 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7183047 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7183048 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7183049 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7183050 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7183051 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7183052 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7183053 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7183054 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7183055 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7183056 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7183057 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7183058 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7183059 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7183060 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7183061 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7183062 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7183063 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7183064 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7183065 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7183066 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7183067 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7183068 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7183069 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7183070 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7183071 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7183072 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7183073 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7183074 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7183075 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7183076 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7183077 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7183078 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7183079 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7183080 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7183081 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7183082 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7183083 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7183084 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7183085 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7183086 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7183087 just wanted to let you know that kathi russ and i loved the wizards they worked out perfectly im sure well be using you again
7183088 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7183089 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7183090 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7183091 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7183092 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7183093 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7183094 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7183095 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7183096 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7183097 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7183098 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7183099 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7183100 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7183101 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7183102 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7183103 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7183104 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7183105 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7183106 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7183107 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7183108 my personal opinion and based on my opinion of the christian faith thats not the type of expression a presidential candidate or anyone following the christian faith ought to make
7183109 helps to juxtapose the dna of sen obama with dna of sen mccain
7183110 many in the christian community have not forgotten sen mccain leaving his first wife for his second wife one month after a disfiguring car accident
7183111 these smears on john mccains character and faith expose the utter hypocrisy of barack obamas claim to represent a new kind of politics its disgraceful
7183112 know that john mccains faith and character were tested and forged in ways few can fathom
7183113 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7183114 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7183115 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7183116 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7183117 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
7183118 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
7183119 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7183120 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7183121 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7183122 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
7183123 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
7183124 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7183125 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7183126 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7183127 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7183128 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7183129 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7183130 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7183131 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7183132 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7183133 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7183134 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7183135 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7183136 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

7183140 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7183141 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7183142 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills

7183145 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7183146 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7183147 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7183148 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7183149 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7183150 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7183151 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7183152 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7183153 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7183154 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7183155 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7183156 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7183157 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7183158 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7183159 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7183160 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7183161 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7183162 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7183163 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7183164 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7183165 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7183166 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7183167 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7183168 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7183169 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7183170 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7183171 if the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left
7183172 the nation will live to regret what the court has done today
7183173 fuck this united states of america bullshit and become the glorious peoples republic of bush and cheney
7183174 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7183175 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7183176 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7183177 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7183178 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7183179 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7183180 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7183181 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7183182 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7183183 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7183184 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7183185 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7183186 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7183187 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7183188 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7183189 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7183190 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7183191 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7183192 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7183193 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7183194 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7183195 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7183196 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7183197 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7183198 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7183199 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7183200 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7183201 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7183202 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7183203 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7183204 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7183205 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7183206 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7183207 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7183208 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7183209 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7183210 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7183211 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7183212 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7183213 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7183214 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7183215 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7183216 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7183217 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7183218 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7183219 wardog 4 allo can you hear me kid you better be muckin our tail son
7183220 looked like you are confident at least dont get separated from me
7183221 man im glad you drew a short straw instead of me

7183224 you are forebidden to fire until i give permission understand
7183225 you got a knack for a comic dialogue you mind sending a surrender request for me
7183226 sheesh testing testing huh attention an unidentified aircraft set your course for our beach immediately
7183227 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7183228 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7183229 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7183230 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7183231 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7183232 without dave there would be no leno there would be no conan obrian there would be no craig kilborn there would be no jon stewart
7183233 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7183234 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7183235 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7183236 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7183237 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7183238 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7183239 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7183240 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7183241 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7183242 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7183243 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7183244 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7183245 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7183246 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7183247 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7183248 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7183249 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7183250 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7183251 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7183252 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7183253 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7183254 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7183255 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7183256 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7183257 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7183258 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7183259 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7183260 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7183261 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7183262 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7183263 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7183264 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7183265 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7183266 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7183267 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7183268 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7183269 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7183270 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7183271 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7183272 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7183273 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7183274 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7183275 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7183276 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7183277 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7183278 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7183279 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7183280 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7183281 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7183282 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7183283 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7183284 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7183285 llevamos m s de un d a sin entrenar sin hacer nada y por eso es que el peso est tan alto pero no tengan duda de que estaremos en el peso para la pelea y que vamos a ganar de cualquier manera esta pelea
7183286 sin entrenar m s de 30 horas con todo lo del viaje pero todo estar bien para la pelea
7183287 desde hace tiempo estamos diciendo que est bamos en el peso y hoy lo demostramos ya que no he hecho mi trabajo de la tarde as que estamos muy bien y ahora a seguir haciendo el trabajo que falta para la pelea
7183288 monitoreando su peso el lunes el mi rcoles y el jueves de la pr xima semana para que no haya problemas en hacer el mismo para la pelea
7183289 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7183290 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7183291 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7183292 it was a tough start there is a lot of rust i have to shake off
7183293 i am glad coach gruden gave me the opportunity to stay in there and continue to compete and thankfully we put a drive together and finished it off well
7183294 i made two very poor decisions tonight which is very unlike me and i think it shows that i havent practiced a lot and havent played at all
7183295 those are things i needed to get out of my system hopefully i can move on from here
7183296 hes ok he would keep going if we let him
7183297 the defense came out and started excellent and created turnovers that is the type of football we definitely want to try and play this year
7183298 offensively we capitalized and did some good things but of course we know we can get better
7183299 no m s para que los leones marinos se sientan libres para trabajar
7183300 ive never experienced a member of congress who is pushing me to come up with more things he can do to advance human rights
7183301 they lead to the big cases and they lead to legislation very often
7183302 the government is heading for a clear victory and this is an endorsement for the governments military campaign against the terrorist tamil rebels

7183314 ive decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership particularly about that
7183315 everyone else is commenting on that ill just leave that to others
7183316 i dont know but ive been told barack obama s good as gold
7183317 barack obama is going to be a great commander in chief and lead our military with honour
7183318 its not only americans but australians that support the message of hope
7183319 there are 100 000 americans living in australia 50 000 in sydney alone and many of them dont know that they can vote from abroad
7183320 they know firsthand the full effects of president george w bush and the loss of respect for the united states
7183321 i think that obama has a world vision and obama supporters believe that hes going to help restore us to be proud and be part of the international community again
7183322 im here because im supporting barack obama and i believe in change
7183323 i agree with the policies of obama particularly his policy to withdraw from iraq which i really believe he stood for since the very beginning
7183324 i think we should get more australians to mobilise the effort
7183325 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7183326 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7183327 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely

7183329 try to use that word or those words more often
7183330 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take

7183335 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7183336 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7183337 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7183338 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7183339 but youve got to have some standards were not animals

7183349 we did the right thing in linking up with the games
7183350 you have to smile in a way that makes passengers feel good make them want to talk to you and accept your service
7183351 if an attendant helps a disabled person to get on the plane by holding his arms the chinese might find it a nice gesture but a foreigner might interpret any physical touch as impolite behaviour
7183352 without the olympics air chinas services and marketing would not have improved this fast
7183353 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7183354 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7183355 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7183356 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7183357 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7183358 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7183359 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7183360 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7183361 never before have the sri lankan forces been better placed to defeat the tamil tigers
7183362 the killer it turned out was a little known smuggler named velupillai prabhakaran
7183363 if investors wait for the entire problem to go away before coming in they could be too late
7183364 at that time i thought booby trapped cars existed only in mickey spillane novels
7183365 we had 18 inches throughout the house and 4 feet in the garage
7183366 the new code is up to i believe 12 feet and my neighbor two houses down has his house up i think to 13 feet
7183367 stay off the roads and if a road is not announced as being closed dont assume that it is open
7183368 after last night i think coming into today we could have folded pretty easily especially when it got to 4 1
7183369 he started to get ahead of guys with the slider and getting the ball down
7183370 coming off last night to bounce back and get a medal this is something ill never forget an olympic medal
7183371 we came in here today and had our work cut out for us
7183372 i didnt mind going by myself if i couldnt get somebody to go there was nothing id rather be doing
7183373 one of ours certainly is we cant produce the same revenues that other teams in our division can
7183374 we feel strongly that payrolls dont decide the standings talent does
7183375 the one buzzword weve talked about a lot the last couple years is being opportunistic
7183376 we have to react to the industry for us to compete in this division and be able to build a team to compete not only in 2008 but for many years we almost have to run a different direction from the industry
7183377 im biased but i feel like weve got great balance up and down our lineup
7183378 were built on pitching and defense which for the most part shows up every night
7183379 were definitely going to get to a point down the road where were not going to be able to keep everyone
7183380 its just a fact of life that in the division were competing in we dont have the same resources as those teams and we never will we cant pretend to be like them and operate like them
7183381 theres been a lot of naysayers and its hard to fault them with our history
7183382 but it has inspired the guys in our clubhouse and they kind of have this us against the world mentality
7183383 hes in good spirits and after his surgery well have our doctors address the surgery
7183384 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7183385 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7183386 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7183387 when i get done with this they can put me on my f pension
7183388 he still isnt where hartline is but i think he will see the field this year
7183389 i am not sure how many he missed but it was more than one chip shot
7183390 empowerment m i n d s motivating and inspiring neighborhoods determined to succeed in january of 2006 which encourages youth to hold leadership roles in their community
7183391 the only way you should know who i am is if i mess up
7183392 i would like to thank all those who have offered their love and support
7183393 my main concern at the moment is the welfare of our family
7183394 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7183395 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said
7183396 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7183397 this proposal should never have been given serious consideration greenpeace climate campaigner john hepburn said
7183398 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland mr hepburn said
7183399 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change
7183400 i dont envy ms bligh given the economic power of the greenhouse mafia but sometime soon she is going to have to make the tough decision to put the future of the state ahead of the vested interests of the coal lobby
7183401 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7183402 i told him help was on its way and they finally they got here
7183403 there was no charcoal or barbeque grill or anything that would indicate how he received these injuries
7183404 the only thing that goes through my head he had his cigarettes and and lighter and the sun and if they were in the sun when he come back from his nephews he went to light a cigarette and he went up in flames
7183405 ive been dying for this moment when i could just hold you all week
7183406 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
7183407 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
7183408 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
7183409 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
7183410 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
7183411 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7183412 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7183413 i think i have a much higher i q than you do
7183414 went to law school on a full academic scholarship the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship
7183415 i did not graduate in the top half of my class at law school and my recollection of this was inacurate
7183416 wouldnt you hate to have every word you say analyzed by the public
7183417 the medical profession thinks fructose is better for diabetics than sugar
7183418 but every cell in the body can metabolize glucose however all fructose must be metabolized in the liver the livers of the rats on the high fructose diet looked like the livers of alcoholics plugged with fat and cirrhotic
7183419 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7183420 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said

7183434 one of our coaches came up before camp started and said all the work weve done in the summer youve just prepared yourself to do well this season we had to come out and have a good camp to be able to do well this season
7183435 we really want to show people what were all about this year junior defensive end erik lorig said
7183436 i think everyones thinking about that this is definitely one of those top feelings i must say above all else that ive had here in terms of our team i think its the first time a lot of people are able to admit that everyone has the same bond coming out of camp
7183437 he was doing a marvelous job harbaugh said of owusu
7183438 he doesnt say anything about his team i dont see anything about our team
7183439 there has been a lot of surprises from the young guys stepping up and learning the system a little quicker than we thought to having all three quarterbacks play at a high level he said
7183440 no i dont know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered as patriots this is one nation under god

7183444 tuve que apurar el paso porque mi cuerpo se cansa cuando corro m s lento
7183445 i got a lot i cant complain everything i got it is just that after that gold i was not able to give my country another medal because of wrist injury or i would have got even more but i got enough
7183446 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised
7183447 dat was ik niet hoor dat was mijn lichaam en dat is alleen maar vel met een spook erin
7183448 must be non contact without protective pads and without blocking sleds and other blocking devices
7183449 we used hand pads and i wasnt aware that we were doing anything wrong
7183450 our athletes are able to wear helmets on the first day of practice so we have kids running around with the possibility of their face masks hitting each other all we did was use the shields for protection
7183451 they say its a safety concern which i dont understand i think as coaches we do a good job keeping kids safe if i was aware of the rules i wouldnt have done it
7183452 i am always looking out for the best interest of the kids
7183453 we shouldnt have done it and hopefully this will be a rule changed for next year i am not sure what will happen penalty wise
7183454 ive yet to hear anything as far as being penalized
7183455 i first heard of this thursday at our section 5 meeting when dick cerone said that he received several complaints about teams from all over doing things of this nature i dont see how its unfair but all i know is that we cant do anything more about it and maybe well be put on probation
7183456 we arent able to be dressed in full equipment until the sixth day of practice
7183457 a bunch of schools showed up on the first day of practice fully dressed
7183458 all we can do from this point is move forward and continue our season
7183459 im just doing the same thing focusing on getting better and improving and focusing on doing whatever the team needs to win
7183460 im preparing the same way preparing to play the best you can nothing changes youre trying to go out there and win the game no matter whos playing it doesnt matter i came out focused on getting better thats all you can do
7183461 every day is about development and doing what you can to improve as a player
7183462 if you go out there and try to improve as a player it makes the team better and goal of winning games better
7183463 i did everything theyve asked me to do i have a 3
7183464 nothing is going to be given to me i have to go out there and get it
7183465 chris is better than he was last year and i think coye is going to do a great job for us tomey said they have a lot of work to do to become a better tandem than owens and lowery but the potential is there
7183466 i dont see it as pressure francies said of replacing lowery
7183467 its not a challenge i look at it as an opportunity im anxious to show just how good we are
7183468 the last time i took off a helmet isnt going to be in an ambulance zusin said after practice friday
7183469 it was scary when i was just laying there couldnt feel anything couldnt move anything zusin said

7183541 any time we have a lead late in the game we feel pretty good because of our bullpen we needed a win and we needed the runs to get back in focus
7183542 any time we have a lead late in the game we feel pretty good because of our bullpen we needed a win and we needed the runs to get back in focus
7183543 we donated too many runs early we got back into the game which was exciting but we missed plays
7183544 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there
7183545 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again

7183551 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7183552 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7183553 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7183554 they had to choose between picking experience and change and they ultimately made the decision that obama has already established himself as the change candidate and what he needed to shore up is the experience side that people had doubts about
7183555 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7183556 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans to this new cause and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7183557 he has been a huge supporter of israel and has been so in a very erudite fashion because he knows all the players not only in israel but in the palestinian authority
7183558 hes a true lunch bucket democrat its a perfect choice
7183559 a generation of democratic voters that sen obama is not doing as well with as he would like at this point would be very attracted to joe biden
7183560 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7183561 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7183562 i dont think it helps in terms of hillary supporters who are still upset or among women who he hasnt really reached out to
7183563 friend i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate
7183564 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7183594 theres no doubt many horse owners are hendra aware and theres been a modest increase in the number of people calling about possible testing dr glanville said
7183595 the increased number of investigations is providing further assurance that this serious virus is not present in the general horse population across the state
7183596 if you have a concern about your horse you should stay away from it and not hesitate to call because we are here to provide our expertise and support and to take action in cases of concern dr glanville said
7183597 when owners and veterinarians with concerns about a sick horse call us they are supporting queenslands effort to effectively monitor our horse population and combat disease

7183655 theres no doubt when you look back at the season theres disappointment because we could have been a lot higher than what we are
7183656 personally i think its disappointing when youre in front of richmond by close to five goals and when youre in front by six goals at three quarter time theyre the two games youve definitely got to chalk in as wins
7183657 its got to go down as a team effort in the good times and the bad times
7183658 we all contributed to our downfall as we all contributed to probably our best quarter of the season in the third quarter
7183659 you obviously want to finish the season strongly you certainly want to feel better about yourself
7183660 and sydneys had the wood over us so it would be nice to end the season with a win
7183661 sydney have struggled for the last few weeks so weve got to go down there and really take them on and test our bodies to see if we have matured against them because theyve manhandled us a bit in the last few years
7183662 i want to get out there and lead the side and make sure we train hard this week and not sulk around the place set the right example
7183663 well wait for the scan but on the appearance of the elbow last night i cant see him getting back this year

7183665 i was at the club when he came along as a little skinny 17 year old from taree and hes given us tremendous service as well as nsw and australia and hes been a model citizen off the field as well
7183666 so he deserves a big send off and i hope the people give him that
7183667 thats one thing about danny buderus he was probably a bit unlucky that he played his career at a time when andrew johns was playing

7183673 i dont fall into any of the next polar extremes on this issue
7183674 have determined that it is imperative to pursue an immediate sale of the company to unlock maximum value for its shareholders
7183675 the company believes that the current lack of liquidity has compressed birch mountains share price to a level significantly below its underlying value
7183676 it is the companys belief that an immediate and focused sale process will maximize value
7183677 in the event this immediate sales process does not achieve an acceptable price the company intends to work with its stakeholders to recapitalize the balance sheet to improve liquidity and permit delivery of the business plan
7183678 the south haul road is an integral link to the proposed east athabasca highway and will facilitate building this new highway that will extend east to several oilsands projects
7183679 this agreement is pivotal for the company and has both short and long term benefits these include the cash payment and the opportunity to sell aggregates for the construction of more than 50 kilometres of new roads in addition the direct road access from our quarry to major oilsands projects in the area will provide long term opportunities to supply aggregate and reagent products into the future
7183680 its outrageous because it tells you this accident didnt have to happen that people were negligent that people either gave false information withheld information and they ought to be held accountable but let me say this also the regulator needs to be held accountable here did they do what they needed to do and i still think thats an open question
7183681 it paints a very unflattering picture it indicates the mine operation was guilty of a reckless and systematic disregard of miners safety and of the mining regulations designed to protect them i know the findings are little consolation to the grieving family members who are still mourning the loss of loved ones if there is any solace to be found it is that msha officials can use the information gleaned from this investigation to make mining safer i am confident with sufficient oversight and direction they will
7183682 nearly a year after this tragedy it is heart wrenching to learn that the fatal crandall canyon mine disaster might have been prevented i hope that we can apply the lessons learned from this report to upgrade mining procedures and improve the safety conditions for our miners
7183683 the report alleges an unacceptable pattern of safety violations and failure to disclose critical information and i expect msha to act aggressively to hold those responsible to account the allegations in mshas report should serve as a wake up call to the mining industry safety regulations must be followed information must be disclosed and expert advice must be heeded
7183684 we will take what weve learned and do everything we can to prevent a similar accident from occurring again in the future
7183685 it didnt pencil out for being a good project for the port of astoria
7183686 it seems sort of strange that all of a sudden it pencils out when he does it for his own company he had some pretty private information that the taxpayers paid for
7183687 we dont have a lot of places left where we can put anything
7183688 theres only a couple allowable areas and rice island is pretty close to being full
7183689 this was a good news project because everybody came together to work on a common problem
7183690 each group had expertise to bring to the table the ports had contacts state doesnt have we own the property we own the material it seemed to be a good way to help everybody achieve their goals and keep the ports operating and viable
7183691 the motivation for us was the placement of dredge material on rice island
7183692 were very dependent on the dredging of the river rice island is running out of room as a depository for new material and its not easy to find new ones
7183693 the conclusion was there probably wasnt a great market for the sand
7183694 but if you placed it in water it would be good fill for building runways
7183695 we tried for quite a while to market that area and have not been successful
7183696 the cost of transporting that material to san francisco seattle or alaska was prohibitive for most companies
7183697 as the new academic year gets under way next week we will begin recruitment for spring 2009 programs and we are certainly hopeful that the rising value of the dollar will encourage more students to participate in programs in europe
7183698 oil prices have made airfares very expensive so getting to europe is still a big obstacle even if it is cheaper once one arrives
7183699 now the dollar does seem to be strengthening but i would think we have a lot of strengthening yet to come before this will negatively impact our position in the marketplace
7183700 for example a salary paid in euros or pounds if the dollar strengthens it means delta is not using so many dollars to pay employees
7183701 se vio que cruz azul era mejor futbol sticamente son fases del futbol un error del

7183705 as hard as i and our devoted management team and all employees have worked davis homes could not survive a housing market that has devastated many other builders and homeowners both in indianapolis and throughout the nation
7183706 none of us could believe it because indianapolis was still the most affordable large market city in the united states so we never saw the big upticks
7183707 people were canceling with us to go buy the cut rate homes
7183708 it just showed that if you do lower your prices you are going to move units
7183709 until the storm clouds go can you take that 40 000 lot and allow us to buy it for 20 000
7183710 the general response was to say they would lower the price but only to about 32 000 it helped for a while but it didnt help enough we knew what we had to pay for a lot in order to continue to make money and have absorption it was really about 50 of the prior years appraised value in that scenario i think the model would have worked but they wouldnt go about 75
7183711 we were uncertain as to whether we could raise dip debtor in possession financing in any meaningful way plus there needed to be an agreement from banks and external developers in order to be able to emerge profitably we couldnt see getting anyone to go as low as we needed to be
7183712 we have gotten no calls from publics regarding our land sites
7183713 we knew there would be losses no matter what even if we had figured out a way to go forward in bankruptcy for example there are losses but the company does go forward so we knew losses were immanent including our own equity but we really tried to look at a lot of solutions to determine a go forward plan

7183720 yolanthe is echt bijzonder ze is ontzettend sociaal ze heeft een luisterend oor voor iedereen en je kan met haar over alles praten we kunnen allebei heel hard lachen om dezelfde dingen zij vindt mij heel droog
7183721 we zijn allebei heel nuchter maar ook gevoelsmensen en we vinden familie allebei heel belangrijk jan en ik zijn beiden heel open bijna altijd vrolijk en ook heel impulsief
7183722 veel mensen vinden ons een rare combinatie yolanthe wordt gezien als die bitch en ik ben die leuke aardige jongen
7183723 door die vooroordelen heb ik even getwijfeld was het wel slim als jan en ik iets met elkaar krijgen ik dacht dat zijn fans mij misschien niet leuk zouden vinden
7183724 ik zei tegen haar als jij bij mij een knopje kunt vinden dat mijn gevoel uitschakelt dan hebben we het probleem opgelost maar ik ben verliefd hier ben ik ik ga niet meer weg

7183732 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7183733 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7183734 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7183735 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7183736 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7183737 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7183738 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7183739 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7183740 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7183741 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7183742 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7183743 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7183744 and it stars burt lancaster as a frenchman working in a paris train yard in the waining days of world war ii
7183745 which told a silly story about heist during a similar point in the war
7183746 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
7183747 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
7183748 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7183749 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7183750 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7183751 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7183752 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
7183753 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7183754 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7183755 i told him it wasnt necessary we have got more important things to worry about we have got iraq we have got health care we have got energy this is low on the list
7183756 if we pass this bill which the democrats irresponsibly oppose well solve this problem
7183757 if we bring a new attitude of hopefulness and respect for the world well make the seas higher and the fish more numerous
7183758 our choice wasnt between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war it was between war and a greater threat dont let anyone tell you otherwise and certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe that saddams iraq was an oasis of peace
7183759 well brian i think looking back there is something to be said for the idea that i will be a better president now than frankly i would have been four years ago
7183760 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
7183761 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments
7183762 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars
7183763 statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7183764 thats the kind of fighter i want on my side
7183765 i dont oppose all wars what i am opposed to is a dumb war i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world
7183766 but beneath his incompetence and insolence there was a character and sense of duty worth not just taking seriously but honouring
7183767 mccain and obama are two evenly matched larger than life figures with riveting biographies
7183768 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7183769 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7183770 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7183771 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7183772 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7183773 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7183774 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years
7183775 cheering for foreign teams would have been unimaginable four years ago much less 20 years ago
7183776 this is the beauty of dictatorship they can do many things that other countries cannot do
7183777 you have to remember they even controlled the weather no other country would do this
7183778 i didnt get what i want so im going to vote against all ive ever believed in whaaaaaaa
7183779 biden hasnt been the running mate for even 24 hours and the repubs are running scared wow this guy must be an even better choice than we thought
7183780 hes able to connect with blue collar voters because of his authenticity
7183781 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7183782 you have sat here to long for any good that you have done
7183783 the pubs have already got smear ads for every possible vp candidate
7183784 the john mccain that joe biden and other democrats praised many years ago is not the mccain running today
7183785 the same mccain i knew then isnt the same mccain i know now stating the he didnt think obama was ready to be president hasnt been that long ago you dems will come up with some way to spin that im sure lol
7183786 you know i did once think that obama was not ready to lead but boy was i wrong he has proven me wrong in the last couple of months by his actions and his words i am looking forward to working with president obama to bring this country back to the great nation it once was barack obama will go down in history as one of the best presidents which is something we will need after 8 years of the worst president
7183787 yeah dems take your families to the safety of one of americas deep blue one party cities like detroit where only 22 of the innocent children ever graduate from high school
7183788 biden hasnt been the running mate for even 24 hours and the repubs are running scared wow this guy must be an even better choice than we thought
7183789 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7183790 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7183791 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7183792 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
7183793 every assignment that god gives his people is his primary means of sanctifying his leader
7183794 every assignment that god gives his people is his primary means of sanctifying his leader some of us are getting burnt out because we are separating the sanctification process from our ministry i understand boundaries rest variety in life etc but the very thing that god is using to draw you to himself is the calling that he has given you
7183795 it was like he was at the beach or something there was no rage in him he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
7183796 we pray for daily life making enough money so that we can eat etc while rich people probably pray for other issues
7183797 have you made the wonderful discovery of the spirit filled life
7183798 for every relationship there needs to be something mediating going in between for that relationship

7183802 i have made millions but they have brought me no happiness
7183803 for the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil
7183804 an immoral act considered to be a transgression against divine law
7183805 when you actually get it it wont actually satisfy the hole in your heart and if in anyway you fail it itll curse you for the rest of your life
7183806 by this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him for whenever our heart condemns us god is greater than our heart and he knows everything beloved if our heart does not condemn us we have confidence before god and whatever we ask we receive from him because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him and this is his commandment that we believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another just as he has commanded us whoever keeps his commandments abides in him and he in them and by this we know that he abides in us by the spirit whom he has given us
7183807 if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother his wife and children his brothers and sisters yes even his own life he cannot be my disciple and anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple
7183808 or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand if he is not able he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace in the same way any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple
7183809 will we still follow christ if someone put a gun to our head
7183810 will we still follow christ if it doesnt benefit us in a worldly sense
7183811 will we still follow christ if that means we would go to prison
7183812 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7183813 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7183814 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7183815 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7183816 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7183817 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7183818 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7183819 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7183820 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7183821 we can say its not for nothing that we have come to the olympics
7183822 of course we had greater plans than this but we have received the bronze medal and we also hope in the future our performance will improve further
7183823 theres a lot of bitterness that we feel a lot of bitterness inside all of us we were hoping for more
7183824 we were hoping to get better results than what we did today

7183838 from a june 2008 address at princeton by robert j rivers jr 53 a former princeton trustee and a vascular surgeon
7183839 princeton university was a southern school with strong southern social preferences it just happened to be above the mason dixon line
7183840 while 13 000 000 negro americans look for signs of their admission to a rightful place in american democracy princeton continues its principle of white supremacy and in an institution devoted to the free pursuit of truth implicitly perpetuates a racial theory more characteristic of our enemies
7183841 oh well im happy that more minorities are finding a place in institutions of higher education so i supposed having an inflation of urms rather paradoxical lol is alright but still colleges should work harder to make sure that their populations are split evenly i mean if a college for whatever reason one day had 25 african american students that would be absurd considering that only 13 of the population is black
7183842 the case for democracy the power of freedom to overcome tyranny and terror
7183843 well others could come forward just as much as i could the interesting thing was i didnt hesitate

7183861 hay vientos de ingobernabilidad al debilitarse el estado de derecho por la creciente delincuencia e inseguridad p blica la autoridad no est cumpliendo cabalmente con su obligaci n inicial cuidar la vida y los bienes de los mexicanos
7183862 no hemos encontrado y no han encontrado suficiente capacidad para detener la grave espiral de violencia y muerte que nunca antes se hab a tenido en nuestro territorio nacional en tiempos de paz
7183863 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7183864 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7183865 mommies are chic and babies are super cute in this delightful book
7183866 there are plenty of reasons to mistrust assad but there could be real benefits to hard headed diplomacy syria is the common denominator of many problems in lebanon the palestinian territories and to a lesser extent iraq they are iran s closest ally but it is also a fundamentally weak and isolated regime we should work to break up its marriage of convenience with iran if syria could be encouraged to act less irresponsibly it could have a real impact in the region
7183867 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7183868 oil has been the mainstay of the syrian economy for over four decades but production passed its peak of 610 000 barrels per day in 1995 and is now falling even more rapidly than had been forecast
7183869 so werden navigationsprogramme ganz spielerisch zur gewohnheit werden und zwar auch f r die breite masse
7183870 das hat dimensionen die wir noch gar nicht erahnen k nnen
7183871 we know more about it now we have at least a game under our belts to try and figure out whats the best way to utilize it and how to make it advantageous and how to keep it from being a problem or another log on the fire that we really dont need so well talk about that this week and try to figure out the best plan if we can utilize it productively we will and if we cant we wont so well just have to see how that goes and try to decide whats the most efficient way to do it
7183872 its nothing where these guys are overmatching us overpowering us or anything like that with a team like us were very keen on details if we dont take care of the little things they look like big things they look like theyre problems and issues
7183873 its just the small things where one guys out of position or one guys not matching the angle of his next defender at the end of the day i think the efforts there but the fundamentals and small details arent
7183874 a lot of the little things lead to bigger things
7183875 a lot of the things we do well that maybe at another point in the game we dont do well then it ends up being a problem but i think thats true not only on the defensive side of the ball but in all three phases of the game the little things can add up to big things theres a certain amount of that thats occurring
7183876 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7183877 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7183878 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7183879 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7183880 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7183881 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7183882 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7183883 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7183884 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7183885 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7183886 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7183887 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7183888 try to use that word or those words more often
7183889 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7183890 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7183891 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7183892 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7183893 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7183894 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7183895 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7183896 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7183897 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7183898 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7183899 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7183900 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7183901 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7183902 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7183903 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7183904 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7183905 china has learned about the world and the world has learned about china
7183906 war on terror to impose a new pax americana on eurasia and particularly in the unruly areas between the caucasus and the khyber pass appear to have gone up in flames in some cases literally over the past two weeks
7183907 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7183908 my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
7183909 why is she with you when she can be with anyone
7183910 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7183911 he did great he got the win for us and he did everything we asked him to do
7183912 i told him he threw the ball great and it was great to see his next start will probably be friday
7183913 mmmm whats that smell i want to eat apple butter right now
7183914 you must have roughage to make the bowels move freely concentrated food processed foods and constipation go hand in hand and then pills laxatives are used more constipation and more pills it is a vicious circle with bad results dont be afraid of cracked wheat cornmeal cut oats raw cabbage onions and celery they are far better than refined flour and the package foods that flood the market they may save some labor in the kitchen but they produce constipation
7183915 as i mentioned earlier you can change almost any setting imaginable on the fly from within windows about the only thing you cant change here is the cpu multiplier youll have to go back into the bios for that
7183916 you must have roughage to make the bowels move freely concentrated food processed foods and constipation go hand in hand and then pills laxatives are used more constipation and more pills it is a vicious circle with bad results dont be afraid of cracked wheat cornmeal cut oats raw cabbage onions and celery they are far better than refined flour and the package foods that flood the market they may save some labor in the kitchen but they produce constipation
7183917 their the cdcs ability to say that theyre going to have ongoing reliable reports of incidence is somewhat questionable unless you have funding for that
7183918 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
7183919 most people consume as much as 25 percent of their total caloric intake from snacks
7183920 if we could replace snacks high in refined carbohydrates with just 1 4 to 1 3 cup of nuts per day we could have a positive impact on nutrient density and the risk of chronic disease
7183921 this is significant in two ways one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of embryo derived stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
7183922 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
7183923 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7183924 por los ideales puritanos y lo que es m s fuerte a n
7183925 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off than with obbama
7183926 the presidency for obama is not something that lends itself to on the job training i stand by that statement
7183927 the evidence indicates that the trinidad and tobago dollar is still overvalued

7183938 the guardians already huge us audience shows that they must be doing something right
7183939 what well try to do is to bring those american readers the best and most relevant of what london produces every day and combine it with political and cultural coverage of the states that is more geared toward a us audiences interests but staying faithful to the guardian sensibility
7183940 there is clearly a demand in the us for the guardian perspective on global news and comment
7183941 under the editorship of the talented political commentator and journalist michael tomasky guardian america will enable us to meet that need providing a discerning us audience with quality multimedia journalism and the very best comment and analysis
7183942 at a time when many media organisations are cutting back we are making a significant investment in our journalism creating a new type of multimedia content which showcases the best guardian journalism and story telling in all its forms
7183943 we hope to make the most of this offering during the american primaries and beyond
7183944 many of our clients tell us the education they get about sex and sexual health is still too little too late and too biological based on their views and experiences we believe much more must be done to improve their sexual health
7183945 working to change our unhelpful culture where sex is viewed negatively and sexually active young people are seen as out of control we need to help young people feel confident about relationships and sex and equip them with the skills to make good decisions so they can enjoy and take responsibility for their sexual health
7183946 committing to making personal social and health education statutory in schools so every child learns about sex relationships and sexuality wherever they live currently too many receive little if any good sex education
7183947 teaching about contraception was not associated with increased risk of adolescent sexual activity or stds adolescents who received comprehensive sex education had a lower risk of pregnancy than adolescents who received abstinence only or no sex education

7183950 ambos el sayo saffron y la sotana blanca han trabajado juntos contra el mal en las respectivas realidades hemos dado prueba de que juntos podemos hacer maravillas
7183951 theres no doubt when you look back at the season theres disappointment because we could have been a lot higher than what we are
7183952 personally i think its disappointing when youre in front of richmond by close to five goals and when youre in front last night by six goals at three quarter time theyre the two games youve definitely got to chalk in as wins
7183953 its got to go down as a team effort in the good times and the bad times
7183954 we all contributed to our downfall as we all contributed to probably our best quarter of the season in the third quarter
7183955 you obviously want to finish the season strongly you certainly want to feel better about yourself
7183956 and sydneys had the wood over us so it would be nice to end the season with a win
7183957 sydney have struggled for the last few weeks so weve got to go down there and really take them on and test our bodies to see if we have matured against them because theyve manhandled us a bit in the last few years
7183958 i want to get out there and lead the side and make sure we train hard this week and not sulk around the place set the right example
7183959 well wait for the scan but on the appearance of the elbow last night i cant see him getting back this year
7183960 i hope we get a huge crowd because he absolutely deserves that
7183961 i was at the club when he came along as a little skinny 17 year old from taree and hes given us tremendous service as well as nsw and australia and hes been a model citizen off the field as well
7183962 so he deserves a big send off and i hope the people give him that
7183963 thats one thing about danny buderus he was probably a bit unlucky that he played his career at a time when andrew johns was playing
7183964 because at any other time and any other player other than andrew johns danny would have gone down in history as our best player
7183965 in all honestly joey was the best but bedsy wasnt all that far off him
7183966 they left us this morning to visit internally displaced camps on the outskirts of mogadishu mr ajos told reuters yesterday
7183967 they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region they are believed to have been kidnapped
7183968 we are seeking to confirm media reports that an australian has allege been kidnapped near mogadishu in somalia a dfat spokeswoman said
7183969 of widespread armed conflict very high threat of terrorist attack against western interests
7183970 there is a very high threat of terrorist attack in somalia dfats travel advice warns
7183971 westerners have been targeted and killed in terrorist attacks throughout somalia including mogadishu

7183975 in kevin 08 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08
7183976 labor was given an outstanding baton but like weve seen at the olympics theres been no baton that has been so catastrophically dropped as the one john howard gave kevin rudd and the one peter costello gave treasurer wayne swan
7183977 ive decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership particularly about that
7183978 everyone else is commenting on that ill just leave that to others
7183979 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and wayne swan they are the ones who have talked our economy down and talked up inflation
7183980 its going to be a real tough couple of weeks
7183981 i think we are going to have to lift it up a peg the next couple of weeks and really get it going
7183982 i think weve still got to lift a bit more
7183983 we are on a bit of a roll the enthusiasm is there and the excitement is there when you are winning
7183984 we are still not at our best but we are doing enough to win games
7183985 with the dragons next week weve had a couple of close games with them already in the last couple of years so we are expecting another tight one
7183986 we know weve got work to do and we spoke after the game about the fact that the standards and the stakes increase again next week
7183987 i think its a matter of how we finish the year where we can put ourselves and take it from there
7183988 i dont think we are thinking too far down the track we know the next fortnight will determine if we get there and where we finish
7183989 once that is sorted out we can reassess after that
7183990 they can score a lot of points and theyve got a lot of ball runners in their side and brett finch is obviously an origin halfback theyve got him steering them around
7183991 we are certainly playing a lot more for each other a lot more unselfish play and people working off the footy for other people and our goal line defence has improved out of sight
7183992 i dont know but ive been told barack obamas good as gold
7183993 barack obama is going to be a great commander in chief and lead our military with honour
7183994 its not only americans but australians that support the message of hope
7183995 there are 100 000 americans living in australia 50 000 in sydney alone and many of them dont know that they can vote from abroad
7183996 they know firsthand the full effects of president george w bush and the loss of respect for the united states
7183997 i think that obama has a world vision and obama supporters believe that hes going to help restore us to be proud and be part of the international community again
7183998 im here because im supporting barack obama and i believe in change
7183999 i agree with the policies of obama particularly his policy to withdraw from iraq which i really believe he stood for since the very beginning
7184000 i think we should get more australians to mobilise the effort
7184001 in kevin 08 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08
7184002 labor was given an outstanding baton but like weve seen at the olympics theres been no baton that has been so catastrophically dropped as the one john howard gave kevin rudd and the one peter costello gave treasurer wayne swan

7184005 the king will say i was hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you invited me in i needed clothes and you clothed me i was sick and you looked after me i was in prison and you came to visit me
7184006 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
7184007 he didnt wait for them to repent and change before he sat down to eat with them
7184008 i see a generation rising up to take their place with
7184009 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
7184010 hopefully it wont be long until im back it was still a little tight and a little sore before i got it worked on but it feels good now it doesnt look like its anything serious
7184011 it was really weird ive never had anything like that before
7184012 i went for a walk with my daughter and wife i had my sunglasses on and i kept taking them off and rubbing them because it was like they had a smear when i got to the field it was real bad it felt like i had a film on my eye but i woke up saturday and it was fine
7184013 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

7184023 i thought we played well at times and created a number of quality scoring chances in the first half
7184024 michigan is a very experienced team and they took advantage of critical mistakes we made in the final third to score their goals
7184025 we showed significant improvement over the butler match and will use the upcoming week to continue to prepare for our season opener against xavier
7184026 i really feel like fort worth is on the map because we have an apple store
7184027 we feel apple will bring in a customer who may not have visited us before
7184028 to see the world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour
7184029 the different styles of aimee mcmaster and jim wehtje really complement each another so far people have really responded to their photos theyre a perfect match for each other
7184030 ive been taking photos since i was a little girl ive always loved nature
7184031 everything in nature astounds me i believe things created by god are so beautiful
7184032 i think i see in nature things other people dont see its part of the gift of being an artist
7184033 it was the first thing that really clicked for me i like the scientific aspect of it
7184034 i think it fits me fine some people have to be creating all the time im the sort that has to mull things over
7184035 dolls are kind of freaky because they have all these wires and gears ive tried plates and forks and rocks but theres nothing inside them road kill can be interesting
7184036 the beautiful patterns that natural subjects often reveal under the tube make me feel that in the end we dont really create
7184037 we only discover how to see the beauty that is already there
7184038 well wait for the scan but on the appearance of the elbow last night i cant see him getting back this year
7184039 i hope we get a huge crowd because he absolutely deserves that
7184040 i was at the club when he came along as a little skinny 17 year old from taree and hes given us tremendous service as well as nsw and australia and hes been a model citizen off the field as well
7184041 so he deserves a big send off and i hope the people give him that
7184042 thats one thing about danny buderus he was probably a bit unlucky that he played his career at a time when andrew johns was playing
7184043 because at any other time and any other player other than andrew johns danny would have gone down in history as our best player
7184044 this must be how it was like when the heroes of greek compete in olympia actually they dont but whatever
7184045 theres no doubt when you look back at the season theres disappointment because we could have been a lot higher than what we are
7184046 personally i think its disappointing when youre in front of richmond by close to five goals and when youre in front last night by six goals at three quarter time theyre the two games youve definitely got to chalk in as wins
7184047 its got to go down as a team effort in the good times and the bad times
7184048 we all contributed to our downfall as we all contributed to probably our best quarter of the season in the third quarter
7184049 you obviously want to finish the season strongly you certainly want to feel better about yourself
7184050 and sydneys had the wood over us so it would be nice to end the season with a win
7184051 sydney have struggled for the last few weeks so weve got to go down there and really take them on and test our bodies to see if we have matured against them because theyve manhandled us a bit in the last few years
7184052 i want to get out there and lead the side and make sure we train hard this week and not sulk around the place set the right example
7184053 oh no oh no fue mi caso yo lo hice todo a mi manera
7184054 mo fo this mo fo that shit let me tell you something we are now playing the house with her or our titts i speak my mind
7184055 howd you get that puzzle so fast you were doing really good then all of a sudden you took all the puzzle pieces off that was something just to win the first one
7184056 i was just laying in there thinking of the 3 of us its pretty good
7184057 i am going to use the pov and put ollie up
7184058 in kevin 08 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08
7184059 labor was given an outstanding baton but like weve seen at the olympics theres been no baton that has been so catastrophically dropped as the one john howard gave kevin rudd and the one peter costello gave treasurer wayne swan
7184060 ive decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership particularly about that
7184061 everyone else is commenting on that ill just leave that to others
7184062 i dont know but ive been told barack obamas good as gold
7184063 barack obama is going to be a great commander in chief and lead our military with honour
7184064 its not only americans but australians that support the message of hope
7184065 there are 100 000 americans living in australia 50 000 in sydney alone and many of them dont know that they can vote from abroad
7184066 they know firsthand the full effects of president george w bush and the loss of respect for the united states
7184067 i think that obama has a world vision and obama supporters believe that hes going to help restore us to be proud and be part of the international community again
7184068 im here because im supporting barack obama and i believe in change
7184069 i agree with the policies of obama particularly his policy to withdraw from iraq which i really believe he stood for since the very beginning
7184070 i think we should get more australians to mobilise the effort
7184071 its going to be a real tough couple of weeks
7184072 i think we are going to have to lift it up a peg the next couple of weeks and really get it going
7184073 i think weve still got to lift a bit more
7184074 we are on a bit of a roll the enthusiasm is there and the excitement is there when you are winning
7184075 we are still not at our best but we are doing enough to win games
7184076 with the dragons next week weve had a couple of close games with them already in the last couple of years so we are expecting another tight one
7184077 we know weve got work to do and we spoke after the game about the fact that the standards and the stakes increase again next week
7184078 i think its a matter of how we finish the year where we can put ourselves and take it from there
7184079 i dont think we are thinking too far down the track we know the next fortnight will determine if we get there and where we finish
7184080 once that is sorted out we can reassess after that
7184081 they can score a lot of points and theyve got a lot of ball runners in their side and brett finch is obviously an origin halfback theyve got him steering them around
7184082 we are certainly playing a lot more for each other a lot more unselfish play and people working off the footy for other people and our goal line defence has improved out of sight
7184083 why your heart is not nearly as beautiful as mine
7184084 compare your heart with mine mine is perfect and yours is a mess of scars and tears
7184085 yours is perfect looking but i would never trade with you
7184086 ich freue mich das ich das erste gold f r kenia gewonnen habe und danke gott daf r
7184087 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7184088 do you have any rooms i know its late ive had a terrible day
7184089 he said he did not want to give a statement
7184090 then all of a sudden the next day police say he made a statement
7184091 the street doesnt belong to individuals it belongs to the community
7184092 we are giving each of you a copy of the reports so that you can see for yourselves we need help
7184093 what about our quality of life living on this highway
7184094 were expending funds and were expending resources we really want to make things go away and the answer is not just a stop sign
7184095 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7184096 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7184097 i like when its up on top with curls hanging
7184098 theyve got to know how to do it the right way
7184099 its more like stylish but comfortable its like be comfortable but look nice
7184100 you dont want to do too much because you have to go to school
7184101 we really see your hair and makeup as being your no 1 accessory perfect is a great word but we dont have to strive for perfection were all beautiful in our own way
7184102 its time for the curly headed girls to embrace their curls
7184103 this place is a godsend it really is everyone is so nice and i can hear
7184104 i thought gosh how many trips are we going to make here because i have two other kids at home this is really so convenient a lot of times you come in and feel like a number you know in emergencies but i felt very important i had a great experience
7184105 todays opening marks the beginning of a new era in improved access to high quality health care in the region
7184106 this new huntley campus provides superior care to individuals and families living here in the fastest growing region of greater mchenry county centegras commitment to community health and wellness is reflected in this beautifully detailed campus that covers a majority of the health care continuum it is based in the goal to keep residents well beyond expectation with convenient access to medical and wellness services
7184107 the addition of centegra immediate care in the huntley algonquin and lake in the hills communities will provide special services that help residents stay healthy and receive timely high quality and compassionate care
7184108 weve had trouble making ends meet here because of key expenses like insurance and real estate taxes our cook county real estate taxes have been going up 50 to 100 percent per year and that played a big part in our decision to sell
7184109 sales have not gone up 50 to 100 percent per year so something had to give we are sad to be leaving but when you are in business you have to make business decisions
7184110 this has been part of gms grand scheme for a long time but for us it happened very quickly within a few months
7184111 my family owns this real estate and i would have to vacate it either way so i just decided to let jeff sullivan buy me out
7184112 obviously since this dealership had its roots in the old busse buick this is a lost piece of history for mount prospect
7184113 because the village has such a diverse revenue stream this wont be a crushing blow but when the economy is slow any loss hurts
7184114 opel had an ad which featured an opel cadet in a tug of war with a live elephant to show how powerful the car was
7184115 so they rented and then purchased the elephant as a promotion and it became a fixture here
7184116 it is strange to see the building emptying and to look out at an empty parking lot
7184117 we eloped three days before he was deployed so im pretty excited to see him
7184118 weve moved to the suburbs and he hasnt even seen the house yet
7184119 this is the best feeling ive ever had in my life
7184120 its a last minute thing thats why it looks so shoddy
7184121 the glide slope gives you an angle to fly at and the indications in the cockpit will tell you if youre below or above that point in space
7184122 youve got to watch your instruments and believe in them
7184123 we know where we are in space and we know what the signal should be at that point
7184124 we find things out of tolerance every once in a while but theyre very reliable systems
7184125 its something different every day i think its the best flying job you could have its never boring
7184126 we ensure the safety of the national air space if something happens it wont be because the system was bad
7184127 are we going to put up the guardrail before somebody goes over the cliff or wait until someone goes over the cliff
7184128 motorists are supposed to obey the law by stopping when they see a pedestrian in a crosswalk but they dont always remember to do that
7184129 we are extremely pleased with the enhancers operation here in st petersburg and our citizens have been quick to adopt them
7184130 over the years ive seen people make mad dashes across midlothian road
7184131 but since the units went in theres been a huge improvement in the reaction of the motorists in yielding i think youre going to find that this is going to be a new wave of pedestrian assistance
7184132 we feel it is the best product on the table right now for crosswalk safety short of a traffic signal
7184133 we strongly encourage its consideration for other communities with pedestrian crosswalk issues
7184134 your letter begs forgiveness for something that happened over sixty years ago
7184135 i must say i know there are at least two sides in a divorce ive been there
7184136 if it had not been for her it would have been really hard to find him
7184137 he was ready to greet his daughter and i was like this is a perfect stranger
7184138 we both love each other and thats very obvious when you see us together
7184139 i finally have a daughter i can see and hold and love
7184140 it will be a whole new experience for me it should be quite exciting
7184141 if you call someone up and they hang up on you youre not prone to redial
7184142 we made a connection that just brought the last 60 years up front
7184143 i started from nothing and had a whole family all in one little letter
7184144 for now it is unknown how serious the injury is
7184145 kom het is veel te koud om hier buiten banden staan te plakken we leggen je fiets achter in de kofferbak en ik breng je thuis kom
7184146 laat mij maar even rustig bandje wisselen als ik bezig ben word ik niet koud
7184147 the dogs are judged on how they meet the breed standards
7184148 its having fun with my dog and getting to say hes extra special
7184149 theyre not as popular today as golden retrievers or yellow labs
7184150 i train them and i hunt with them in wisconsin
7184151 daisy is full broke to hunt that means she will point at a bird and not touch it until i get there
7184152 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7184153 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7184154 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7184155 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7184156 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7184157 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7184158 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7184159 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7184160 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7184161 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7184162 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7184163 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7184164 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7184165 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7184166 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7184167 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7184168 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7184169 it was here in springfield where i saw all that is america converge
7184170 it was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable that it is possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised and that so long as we are willing to listen to each other we can assume the best in people instead of the worst
7184171 i would guess theyre going to try to keep illinois out of the spotlight and if illinois is in the spotlight it will be a challenge for them to show the unity and hope that the national campaign is trying to emphasize
7184172 i think its something like four oclock in the morning in the mens room of the convention center speaking to a handful of voters im hopeful i can persuade them and we can carry colorado
7184173 they kill jobs they kill education funding they try to take away health care from people
7184174 voters know that in illinois and in washington barack obama stood up to members of both parties to pass sweeping ethics reforms that reduced the influence of money and special interests over the legislative process
7184175 the campaign is aware of whats going on in illinois
7184176 i think its fair game and i think the republicans nationally should pounce on it
7184177 its not about willpower we treat our clients with therapy
7184178 what i learned the past 10 years is very sad its unbelievable the destruction this causes
7184179 we found that unless youve experienced it you dont really know the experience of losing a child from drugs
7184180 even compared to suicide leukemia or a car accident drugs have a terrible stigma
7184181 i know mary and germaine are just a phone call away
7184182 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7184183 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7184184 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7184185 he would have needed a lot of skill to get to the ball and he has it
7184186 but i thought the ball would get through the infield
7184187 you have to stay calm on the outside for the kids you dont want to panic
7184188 i told him if hes going to compete hes going to have days like this
7184189 its not the last time its going to happen to him in his life its a good learning experience
7184190 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7184191 i have people here that recognize me by my dog
7184192 she did a nice job and her prices are reasonable
7184193 its a delightful event and its good to see participation in glen ellyn
7184194 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7184195 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7184196 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7184197 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7184198 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7184199 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7184200 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7184201 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7184202 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7184203 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7184204 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7184205 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7184206 let me entertain you cause we wanted to avoid a crowded station
7184207 est ce quil ya personne avec une d rive cha ne
7184208 lets do something stupid just to look or feel cool we will force ourselves to have a laugh by doing something incredibly stupid
7184209 daar is toch niets aan elke zaterdag en zondag vroeg gaan fietsen dat is toch altijd hetzelfde
7184210 ik zit elk weekend met mijn vriend in de kroeg en dat is zo gezellig we maken het altijd laat en dan op zondag slapen we de hele dag uit
7184211 r ntgenfoto overbodig zou zijn omdat ze er toch niets aan konden doen
7184212 hangt er een beetje vanaf meestal zo rond de 10 000 per jaar en u
7184213 18 000 kilometer heb ik dit jaar gefietst we gaan regelmatig op een zaterdag of zondag met een groepje fietsen lange tochten toch wel zon 150 tot 200 kilometer
7184214 vroeger h maar ja toen was ik nog jong h vroeger dan fietste ik de alpe dhuez op en dan ging ik in de eerste meters staan op de pedalen en dan ging ik niet meer zitten ook h mwoah half uur was ik toch wel boven maar dat kan ik niet meer hoor hartproblemen weet je wel maar ik fiets nog steeds veel in de bergen maar wel rustiger aan h
7184215 zelfs lance armstrong heeft meer dan een half uur werk om boven te komen dat verhaal klopt dus nooit
7184216 o werklik nou hoekom dink jy jou naam is flippiefanus
7184217 ek kry onwillekeurig die indruk dat jy nie wil glo dat my naam werklik flippiefanus is nie
7184218 by reading great books and identifying with the characters in these books for the first time in their lives probationers begin to look at life objectively instead of subjectively
7184219 the judge probation officer and teacher all authority figures to us they were all there for us to listen to us guide us and direct us it was their belief in the program and us that helped me deal with a lot of shame
7184220 this group was a connection a bond with other women who all acted one way and felt totally another i wasnt alone
7184221 combining bibliotherapy and positive role modeling as an alternative to incarceration
7184222 what are you going to do kill me for what
7184223 he is up there to help people and that to me is the principal criterion
7184224 joe biden and i see eye to eye on the way this country should be run
7184225 i didnt do anything that was illegal i just had bad information
7184226 if i had known what had been going on it would have been handled differently
7184227 the republicans dont like me i know theyd like to figure out some way to jerry rig this to make this look like something it was not

7184279 i thought real hard about this and i have come to the conclusion i am really honored by the nomination but i cant in good faith accept the award given the ongoing and precedent setting records lawsuit against the port of olympia

7184282 the interesting thing is the coalition will recognize one member of a body that stands out from the rest in doing the right thing i think we recognized that paul is a champion of open government
7184283 even though he is in a situation where hes in the minority personally i dont think thats a reason to turn it down maybe well talk to him and see if we can persuade him otherwise
7184284 the badge and service pistol that his father harry schultz retired policeman wore a quarter of a century ago were presented to the rookie
7184285 a nasty damp and miserable christmas day our christmas dinner was less than ordinary and a fight in the mess hall added to our low morale
7184286 we were cheered by our thoughts of the palermo christmas party
7184287 my grandfather at the turn of the century and in the teens was captain of the string band
7184288 she was direct and honest and always gave individuals a second chance
7184289 i play the field and it looks like i just hit a home run with you
7184290 thank god youre good looking now go back where you came from where i can just imagine a better pick up line
7184291 we eloped three days before he was deployed so im pretty excited to see him
7184292 weve moved to the suburbs and he hasnt even seen the house yet
7184293 this is the best feeling ive ever had in my life
7184294 it was here in springfield where i saw all that is america converge
7184295 it was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable that it is possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised and that so long as we are willing to listen to each other we can assume the best in people instead of the worst
7184296 i would guess theyre going to try to keep illinois out of the spotlight and if illinois is in the spotlight it will be a challenge for them to show the unity and hope that the national campaign is trying to emphasize
7184297 i think its something like four oclock in the morning in the mens room of the convention center speaking to a handful of voters im hopeful i can persuade them and we can carry colorado
7184298 they kill jobs they kill education funding they try to take away health care from people
7184299 voters know that in illinois and in washington barack obama stood up to members of both parties to pass sweeping ethics reforms that reduced the influence of money and special interests over the legislative process
7184300 the campaign is aware of whats going on in illinois
7184301 i think its fair game and i think the republicans nationally should pounce on it
7184302 im sorry son but i told you not to go just stay home
7184303 let us break the seal which seals up holy things and give wings to truth in order that she may win every soul that comes into the world
7184304 the 15th century everything changes human thought discovers a mode of perpetuating itself gutenbergs letters of lead supersede orpheuss letters of stone the invention of printing is the greatest event in history it is the mother of revolution
7184305 whether it be providence or fate gutenberg is the precursor of luther
7184306 we made a short halt at frankfort on the main i would have liked to visit the birthplace of gutenberg but no memorandum of the house has been kept
7184307 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion
7184308 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7184309 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7184310 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7184311 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7184312 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7184313 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7184314 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7184315 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7184316 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7184317 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7184318 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7184319 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7184320 i follow enjoy and am interested in politics the same way a lot of people in this country are with football
7184321 it signals a new beginning a new beginning for our country
7184322 i think well demonstrate how far weve come since dr kings speech
7184323 i just dont think i should be going to a national convention when we have problems here at home
7184324 id hate to see us divide the party but i understand the thought
7184325 to see her personally and get a feel for her personally should be completely different
7184326 i think it goes back to sen obamas experience in community service and community organizing
7184327 plop literario azaroso repentino imprevisible en medio del paisaje urbano platense
7184328 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
7184329 weve got to look at some sort of tax increase for our education situation
7184330 being a conservative republican maybe thats hard to say but i dont know any other way we can do it we need to educate our children and it does take money
7184331 its been common practice to have supervision before and after school
7184332 some say thats a moral obligation thats true but having a moral obligation is one thing being able to pay for it is another
7184333 we have tried to refrain from advocating any specific tax increase but i can tell you that the conditions that are facing school districts today thats going to provide some cover for lawmakers to make some very unpopular decisions
7184334 i know there is a greater public sentiment for that discussion to occur but i dont have a feeling right now about how great it is
7184335 lets let the republicans who are in charge come up with some proposals
7184336 in order to build political support for what has to be done you have to feel some pain
7184337 its not all bad to have people say gee we didnt realize that we were not actually going to get everything we wanted without paying more in taxes in a sense this is a good exercise to go through
7184338 there are no new initiatives theres no restoration of funding that was eliminated last year
7184339 when an economy is good and there is money the enrollment doesnt go up and the legislature says why do you need money when the economy is bad our enrollment shoots up and theres no money
7184340 we cant hide behind the no new taxes any more
7184341 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7184342 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7184343 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7184344 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7184345 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7184346 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7184347 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7184348 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7184349 im sorry son but i told you not to go just stay home
7184350 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7184351 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7184352 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7184353 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7184354 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7184355 we are having flooding issues in the county right now and the yankeetown and inglis area get it historically because of the drainage pattern in levy county where god wants the water to go out to the gulf of mexico
7184356 we are moving assets to inglis area to make sure we meet the needs
7184357 i havent heard of anybody being flooded out of their homes yet their yards are flooded and their septic systems are going down
7184358 the recovery centers are a place where people can go for water or just to get in some air conditioning and to get some information
7184359 the rain has tapered off some of the roads got wet very quickly and were treacherous to drive down
7184360 we had some branches down but none caused any damage
7184361 sunday is still going to be overcast with a few breaks as our friend fay slowly gets out shes a very unwelcome guest
7184362 as we start getting into tuesday we are looking at more climatological weather with partly cloudy skies and afternoon thundershowers
7184363 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tabhes to sit at
7184364 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7184365 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7184366 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7184367 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7184368 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7184369 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7184370 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7184371 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7184372 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7184373 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
7184374 sometimes with younger people theyre a little more skeptical but they are becoming more and more aware of how important grassroots movements are
7184375 i think the event is a good way to call attention to the issues
7184376 the survey asked some pretty decent questions that are necessary to know for voting
7184377 overall i think the main voting for president is important
7184378 the questions about the environment made you think about whether you really care about it or not but most questions were easy for me to answer
7184379 i learned how much the environment and the war mean to people
7184380 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7184381 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7184382 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7184383 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7184384 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7184385 my relationship with the church of god has been broadened and deepened
7184386 but jesus called the ten to him and said those who are regarded as ruling among the gentiles lord it over them as you know and their great men oppress them
7184387 i can personally attest to the fact that the park is bigger than one acre
7184388 so why not green acres park also when did this park come into existence and whose idea was it to name it green acre park
7184389 i remember questioning some of the older staff members about it and having some of them say well this map or that map says its green acres
7184390 no one could explain to me why it said differently on the sign i didnt even realize until right now that theres still a sign out there
7184391 i seem to remember that we didnt go through any formal procedure
7184392 i think we sort of just started calling it green acres by neighborhood consensus
7184393 the neighborhood did not want to see that park developed for active recreation
7184394 they preferred it to be passive and they didnt want any kind of a big parking area set up since the park is right next to a bunch of homes
7184395 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7184396 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7184397 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7184398 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7184399 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7184400 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7184401 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7184402 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7184403 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7184404 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7184405 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7184406 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7184407 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7184408 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7184409 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7184410 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7184411 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7184412 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7184413 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7184414 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7184415 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7184416 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7184417 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7184418 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7184419 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7184420 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7184421 there is no way that the bill would have had any effect on any method of abortion
7184422 americans can differ on the issue of abortion but senator obamas extreme record on this issue and his willingness to misrepresent that record should concern any american who believes that we should be working towards a society where there are fewer abortions not more
7184423 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
7184424 even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
7184425 so for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
7184426 it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive
7184427 the obama campaign even had to acknowledge yesterday that all along whether intentionally or not they had basically been misrepresenting what he did
7184428 theres no question in my mind that when he killed that bill in his committee in 2003 he was killing a bill that was identical to the one that boxer heartily endorsed on the floor
7184429 sen obama has repeatedly mischaracterized this hes given so many false and at times even conflicting explanations for what he did that its been very hard for the truth to come out
7184430 this is a vote thats so over the top and so unpalatable that its almost hard for people to believe its difficult to explain because if you dont give a full explanation i think most people would say that cant be true thats impossible no one would do that
7184431 now that hes had to admit what he did i wouldnt want to be his consultant right now trying to justify what he did
7184432 how is it still possible to speak of the dignity of every human person when the killing of the weakest and most innocent is permitted in the name of what justice is the most unjust of discriminations practised some individuals are held to be deserving of defence and others are denied that dignity
7184433 truly truly i say to you every one who commits sin is a slave to sin
7184434 take part in a propaganda campaign in favour of such a law or vote for it
7184435 now we are focusing on linking the region to south east asia on the basic assumption that south east asia begins in north east india
7184436 thats why i have been urging northeastern states to agitate much more with the central government to argue their case before us to factor in the importance of developing ne and determine what our strategy should be for development of the region
7184437 were seeing a lot of money pouring into that race so that will be one to watch
7184438 theres a lot of frustration right now as a result of the budget cuts
7184439 we would certainly hope all the people who have registered with an eye on the november election will become enthusiastic voters and turn out for the aug 26 election as well
7184440 its possible the general excitement of the 2008 presidential election is going to bring more people to the polls for the primary but if those newly registered voters are really just waiting until nov 4 we could see a decrease in the percentage for turnout on tuesday
7184441 we chose riverbed technologys high performance steelhead platform for our managed wan acceleration service because it enhances application visibility and improves application response time and wan efficiency
7184442 riverbed is helping us to deliver on our commitment to offer a world class experience to our business customers their platform offers significant scalability which is enabling us to meet the needs of our multinational customers
7184443 most customers are choosing to make the term of the new managed wan acceleration service saas offering match that of their current wan circuit contract so that they can make a decision on new technology or upgrades to existing technology when they are considering the renewal of their circuit contract
7184444 attorney general michael mukasey has agreed to allow congressional hearings but not to delay the implementation of new fbi regulations that would allow them to spy on american citizens who are not suspected of any crime
7184445 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7184446 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7184447 dont worry bout a thing cause every little thing is gonna be alright
7184448 seven kinds of people will be sheltered under the shade of allah on the day of judgment they are
7184449 quietly but with breathtaking speed india and its millions of world class engineering business and medical graduates are becoming enmeshed in americas new economy in ways most of us barely imagine
7184450 the united states imports oil from saudi arabia cars from japan tvs from korea and whiskey from scotland so what do we import from india we import people really smart people
7184451 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated
7184452 man must have an original cradle land whence the peopling of the earth was brought about by migration
7184453 if there is a country on earth which can justly claim the honour of having been the cradle of the human race or at least the scene of primitive civilization the successive developments of which carried into all parts of the ancient world and even beyond the blessings of knowledge which is the second life of man that country is assuredly india
7184454 in india today we have a lady born a catholic sonia gandhi stepping aside so a sikh manmohan singh could be sworn in by a muslim president abdul kalam to lead a nation thats 82 hindu i defy anyone to cite another country with such diversity and tolerance to its political leadership
7184455 the bonds of ethnicity and culture which hold together the peoples of this region are more enduring than the barriers of political prejudice that have been erected quite recently
7184456 we can pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we get to alderaan
7184457 theres no doubt when you look back at the season theres disappointment because we could have been a lot higher than what we are
7184458 personally i think its disappointing when youre in front of richmond by close to five goals and when youre in front by six goals at three quarter time theyre the two games youve definitely got to chalk in as wins
7184459 its got to go down as a team effort in the good times and the bad times
7184460 we all contributed to our downfall as we all contributed to probably our best quarter of the season in the third quarter
7184461 you obviously want to finish the season strongly you certainly want to feel better about yourself
7184462 and sydneys had the wood over us so it would be nice to end the season with a win
7184463 sydney have struggled for the last few weeks so weve got to go down there and really take them on and test our bodies to see if we have matured against them because theyve manhandled us a bit in the last few years
7184464 i want to get out there and lead the side and make sure we train hard this week and not sulk around the place set the right example
7184465 sometimes i throw a fifth in there to surprise him and let me tell you hes made some amazing catches even all five
7184466 ive seen him take down a cup sitting on top of the orange gatorade bucket
7184467 i was off all right but missed by only a couple of inches from 40 yards and im ticked
7184468 a lot of guys are walking around here with gum on their spikes
7184469 its like waiting for a flower to blossom when you coach the young guys coming in and the older guys emerging its a beautiful thing
7184470 drie keer top acht drie keer top twaalf en drie keer top zestien is redelijk maar je wilt toch op het podium staan niet dat we gedoodverfde podiumkandidaten hadden maar je hoopt gewoon dat je in de buurt van dat podium komt
7184471 we hebben twee plussen gehad de zevenkamp van jolanda keizer en de finaleplaats van de estafetteploeg keizer is een mooi voorbeeld hoe samenwerking tot resultaat kan leiden haar persoonlijke coach en de bondscoach werken nauw samen zo kun je resultaten in elkaar sleutelen
7184472 zij ontwikkelt zich nog elke dag daar gaan we in de toekomst nog veel plezier aan beleven
7184473 ive never experienced a member of congress who is pushing me to come up with more things he can do to advance human rights
7184474 they lead to the big cases and they lead to legislation very often
7184475 teleurstellend gezien voorgaande spelen had ik een winnende tijd van in de 2 14 verwacht dan zou ik onder deze omstandigheden misschien bij de eerste twaalf kunnen komen maar dat er 2 06 gelopen wordt door de winnaar is echt ongelooflijk ik had wat meer verwacht dan een plaats bij de eerste veertig
7184476 ik heb geprobeerd veel te drinken in het begin omdat ik weet dat het later in de wedstrijd amper nog lukt ik heb een paar keer aan stoppen gedacht maar ik ken het belang van deze wedstrijd ik wil door ik moet door heb ik mezelf steeds maar voorgehouden ik ben blij dat ik gefinisht ben en dat op een goede manier deed niet wankelend of strompelend het zal wel even duren voor ik weer een wedstrijdje zal lopen deze marathon is me zwaar gevallen
7184477 todos hacemos lo mismo cada noche sentarnos en la mesa de la cocina y hablar de c mo pagar las facturas mccain no tiene esas preocupaciones en cu ntas de sus siete cocinas se sentar
7184478 el pa s no requiere un buen soldado sino un l der sabio conozco a mccain desde hace 35 a os y les recuerdo que nadie ha apoyado a bush tanto como l en la guerra de irak o en una pol tica econ mica que ha perdido tres millones de empleos en las f bricas

7184490 i think its great that you focus on moms and family in relationship to the workplace i also think its great that you are more choosy than most when it comes to whom you allow to post jobs as well as screening them for scams thats the scariest part of this whole job hunt thing
7184491 baby is strong and has a good suckling response baby and mom are calling to each other and it looks good for a reintroduction later tonight

7184494 now that cobblers out of oven am thinking nap first then pig roast
7184495 well thats the first time ive seen a street squabble actually broken up by the police lights sirens and jumping out with tazers drawn
7184496 i could take this rainy overcast weather for a few more days nice and cool for a change
7184497 are you serious mom im going to have to judge you on that
7184498 set out each day believing in your dreams know without a doubt that you were made for amazing things
7184499 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7184500 i dont think its really sunk in yet im really happy
7184501 it feels amazing i was just honoured to be here at my third games and to come out again on the podium i dont think its really sunk in yet im really happy
7184502 my nerves were really high it was really intense in there when youre looking around its really hard to focus with all those lights
7184503 i think thats why it felt so intense more so than the last olympics i thought id be able to handle it better but i was nervous i was shaking out there
7184504 he lets you be your own person he doesnt put pressure on you and that works he tries to get you to push your limits but at the same time he steps back and lets you learn from yourself
7184505 motivated athletes really shine if they can work at their own pace
7184506 when you spend that much time with someone they have a huge influence on your life
7184507 lets say youre a police officer with a radar gun with karen its like that radar just went off when you see real talent it hits you in the head
7184508 the goal is to allow them to grow up as people to have inner confidence to stand alone in the international world of sport and in life
7184509 athletes arent robots i dont program them to do what i want them to do we work together
7184510 primer encuentro regional para la protecci n de los derechos de ni as ni os y adolescentes en viajes y turismo
7184511 i know i know i said the same but the price of the pint is the same as anywhere else

7184513 i cant believe all the stuff in the papers hes getting more coverage than
7184514 at the time we were just training and we were told not to answer the public on day one at the switchboards ronnie being ronnie did and was not able to complete the connection the altercation described did not take place it was however between the would be telephonist and a male caller not the wife of the minister for p amp t the customer was appeased and accepted an apology in fairness ronnie subsequently beefed up this minor incident for comic effect not wanting to let facts interfere with a good story that was his way
7184515 so you say you were one of the best at
7184516 i was pretty good myself back in the day too bad theres no way to prove such a claim
7184517 my next goal is to get the world record maybe next year
7184518 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7184519 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down with six kilometers left i tried to push it was hard but they didnt keep up
7184520 the start was o k because it wasnt so hot but during the race the weather was bad
7184521 in the last 10 kilometers it was unbelievable what the kenyans and africans were able to do in these conditions
7184522 its true its a flat course but its still an olympic marathon
7184523 as a team we really wanted it we planned for it and came through
7184524 it was very important for kenya to win a medal in the olympics

7184526 at the end of the day i am going to bloody beat this thing because ive got two amazing kids to live for and theres no way im gonna let them down
7184527 i was shocked and confused i was filled with so many emotions no matter what happened at big brother i had spent considerable time with her in the house i felt really bad for her now i know why i couldnt recognize her when i met her life has put her through so much she had changed
7184528 speaking to her was not easy it was very tough there was never any rancour
7184529 there is no question of tata factory moving out of singur if the chairman of the company wants to set up a plant in some other state i have no problem i would really want him to stay in singur

7184536 we know we cant tell you to drink sensibly so go out and booze at bars and parties but please dont kill yourself or anyone around you
7184537 yes i slept with bobby and not you but thats because i respect you
7184538 most men who indulge themselves in pornography would be appalled despite the immediate response if their wife or girlfriend walked into the bedroom wearing fishnets stilettos and a latex corset and wanted to get nasty
7184539 i didnt get nasty with you because i respect you
7184540 lets just be friends i want to sleep with the milkman and you are getting in my way

7184549 a few people were mentioning us in a very high regard back in 2004 and the state of georgia was on fire but nationally it seems more of the thing to say this year that georgia has a chance
7184550 how we handle that will determine how far we go
7184551 frustrated on the lack of movement on that front i finally decided to do something very ambitious very exciting very mid life crisisy
7184552 the idea was to make it on the fly on the cheap but to make it to turn out a really thrilling professionalish piece of entertainment specifically for the internet
7184553 there was no mistaking the power and symbolism of the opening ceremonies for the beijing olympic games on august 8 that multimedia spectacular did far more than trace chinas 5 000 year history it was a statement that china is a major civilization that demands and deserves its rightful place in the global hierarchy there was also no mistaking the symbolism of seeing president george w bush waving cheerfully from his spot in the bleachers while chinese president hu jintao sat behind what looked like a throne its hard to imagine that chinas government which obsesses over every minute issue of diplomatic protocol had not orchestrated this stark image of americas decline relative to the country to which it owes 1 4 trillion it would be hard to imagine franklin delano roosevelt or ronald reagan accepting a similar relative position
7184554 the world is not ready for the post american era until it is the world needs a new kind of american leader a leader able to inspire americans to fix their problems at home and work with partners across the globe in promoting a common agenda as bold and progressive as the order built from the ashes of world war ii 60 years ago
7184555 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7184556 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7184557 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7184558 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7184559 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7184560 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7184561 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7184562 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7184563 catholics who attempt to confer a sacred order on a woman and the women who attempt to receive a sacred order are by their own actions separating themselves from the church
7184564 we are roman catholics the all male hierarchy and their legal traditions came along with the spiritual package that we embrace we do not have to embrace both if they are contradictory
7184565 nothing or no one can stop the action of gods spirit moving in the church we are not discouraged by excommunication in fact in many ways it is a catalyst for growth
7184566 just as in personal fantasy you dont have to worry about mechanics your legs stretch as wide open as you wish there are no unseemly smells or tastes or textures and your partner looks precisely as good as you want him or her to look
7184567 i experienced cybersex for the first time and i have never been so turned on in my life it gave birth to and brought out my animal we reveled in fantasyland it was a constant daily fever what a rush
7184568 i personally have only had cybersex with one person and although i was alone it was probably the best sex of my life would i want to have real sex with this guy of course i think i would but im smart enough to know that it is the separation of reality and fantasy that makes the whole cybersex thing so sexy
7184569 had his genius been only contemplative he had been fitted to his life but with his energy and practical ability he seemed born for great enterprise and for command and i so much regret the loss of his rare powers of action that i cannot help counting it a fault in him that he had no ambition wanting this instead of engineering for all america he was the captain of a huckleberry party pounding beans is good to the end of empires one of these days but if at the end of years it is still only beans
7184570 you can achieve whatever you want as long as you are willing to pay the price
7184571 what was the name of my third grade teacher its on the tip of my tongue
7184572 im really excited about the date i have lined up for this weekend
7184573 maybe ill have my friend help me change the car battery instead
7184574 no my life is actually pretty meaningful if i stop to think about it
7184575 you know what your headlines are all wrong i disagree with your perception
7184576 you say that nothings going right in your life and i know that you feel that way but the way you describe your relationship with your friends it sounds like youre there for them and theyre there for you im getting the sense that its really important for you
7184577 if i had told you two months ago when we first started working together that youd be feeling differently in three months time that youd be feeling the way youre feeling today what would you have said
7184578 we will not know for many years whether the intervention will work or in the worst case do harm
7184579 by the summer of 2007 there were promising results with regard to the effectiveness of the hpv vaccine in the prevention of precancerous lesions caused by the hpv 16 and hpv 18 serotypes however serious questions regarding the overall effectiveness of the vaccine in the protection against cervical cancer remained to be answered and more long term studies were called for before large scale vaccination programs could be recommended unfortunately no longer term results from such studies have been published since then
7184580 we dont earn much but as opposed to other countries education and health care is for free
7184581 this is a transformation point in the 20 year history of mass market wireless devices one which we believe will set the table for the next level of innovation and growth
7184582 verizon wireless is not changing our successful retail model but rather for customers looking for a different wireless experience
7184583 there are a lot of reasons why mobile voip has not yet taken off and they differ by region
7184584 in the u s a key reason is that mobile operators are deliberately trying to keep their customers from being able to use it

7184589 never underestimate a pigeon carrying a memory card hovering above your head ready to download
7184590 there has been a depiction this week of manhunt being republican all my life i have never voted to the right and have always been generous to 20th century democrats gay and lesbian advocates and defenders hrc and the ngltf
7184591 i was arrested at the supreme court and fda in act up actions and was the founder of the grass roots gay rights fund which over the years has raised more than 800k i was the treasurer of out week magazine which was a powerful force in its time i began giving obama donations in march 2007 and i have sent several checks that have yet to be reported it should be known that jonathan crutchleys donation to mccain left the entire board in disbelief i am disappointed that we have lost some customers and i understand the anger it is too bad for the web site if we lose customers but please never refer to me as a republican i consider it an offense earlier today at the request of the board jonathan has stepped down as chairman
7184592 when i was running for governor in 2001 not many people knew who i was in fact a lot of people still dont know who i am pawlenty said during a swing through key swing areas of the key swing state of pennsylvania
7184593 you may not know who i am but im here representing someone that you know well and the country needs for this moment in time in our history our candidate for president of the united states i know you know him well
7184594 the comparison of biden and pawlenty in terms of their r sum s and track records will favor the democrat
7184595 he is going to arrive at any vice presidential debate with a certain amount of presence
7184596 we just dont know if tim pawlenty will be able to match him on that maybe he will maybe he wont there are just a whole lot of questions about how pawlenty would fare
7184597 the delegates are here to conduct official party business including the most important business of all and that is nominating our candidate
7184598 come downtown because you never know who youre going to run into weve got a pretty good a list of whos who from both the political and entertainment scenes coming in
7184599 it occurred to me one night that we were doing our jobs backwards ringham recalled
7184600 we have two products the web based one and the newsprint one
7184601 opinion journalism especially depends on give and take and timeliness ringham said
7184602 we need to be engaging with readers when they are interested we shouldnt ask that the reader to wait until wednesday to discuss news that happened on monday
7184603 if we do this right well be able to converse with readers throughout the day
7184604 it felt like i hadnt thrown in a week ill throw wednesday then take a day off hopefully i can turn up the volume thursday
7184605 he attacks hitters by throwing strike one with all three pitches
7184606 its not been perfect up to this point but theres a lot of talent there and a lot of ability there
7184607 we just have to keep pushing along and open up different avenues and different ways to get to him hes fun to watch
7184608 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7184609 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7184610 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7184611 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7184612 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7184613 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7184614 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7184615 the rise of the internet and bloggers has made the party more progressive
7184616 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
7184617 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help
7184618 we didnt really imagine the kind of growth that we could achieve
7184619 i think that we were planning to be about half the size that we are over the course of five years
7184620 depends on three things leadership common purpose and a degree of tolerance
7184621 you dont need a huge infrastructure to win an election
7184622 you do need that kind of infrastructure to change the country to overcome the huge special interests and have the creativity and boldness to do big important things
7184623 imitation is a sincere form of flattery we appreciate it even when those of a different ideological persuasion imitate us
7184624 they cant come up with five crisp statements based on the founding of this country to explain their philosophy
7184625 the single most important and most consequential part of the movement has become the blogs
7184626 thats where most progressives get their news theyve moved tens of millions into the political system
7184627 government shouldnt be telling any man or any woman when they should and shouldnt start their families
7184628 i dont know who you are or where you came from but hang on to your hat because you are going for a ride
7184629 weve had people on the ground there for three years
7184630 there are 35 000 new voters who moved from other states to north carolina we already know them
7184631 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7184632 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7184633 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7184634 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7184635 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7184636 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7184637 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7184638 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7184639 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7184640 my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
7184641 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7184642 my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
7184643 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7184644 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7184645 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7184646 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government about eight americans currently being detained in beijing we have asked for their immediate release and are continuing to follow their cases closely
7184647 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7184648 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7184649 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7184650 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7184651 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7184652 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7184653 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7184654 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7184655 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7184656 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7184657 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7184658 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7184659 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7184660 to even mention the name of a candidate within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election
7184661 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7184662 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7184663 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7184664 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7184665 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7184666 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7184667 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7184668 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7184669 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7184670 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7184671 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7184672 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7184673 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7184674 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7184675 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7184676 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7184677 who are open to doing something on the production side
7184678 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7184679 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7184680 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7184681 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7184682 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7184683 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7184684 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7184685 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7184686 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7184687 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7184688 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7184689 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7184690 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7184691 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7184692 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join me in making washington work for the american people
7184693 its good to be back in springfield feels like im comin home
7184694 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record a man with fundamental decency
7184695 no one knows better than i do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which youre tested and challenged every single day
7184696 and over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans theres something about barack obama that allows him to bring people together like no one i have worked with and seen
7184697 president lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place then stand firm
7184698 today springfield i know my feet are in the right place and i am proud to stand firm for the next president barack obama
7184699 and theres a lot to be learned from this setting from lincoln i think using lincoln as a backdrop is always good politics
7184700 brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class
7184701 out of the heartbreak of that unspeakable accident he did more than become a senator he raised a family
7184702 these times call for a total change in washingtons world view
7184703 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7184704 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7184705 if you look at kennedy who was young and represented change and hope he went and got lyndon johnson who knew how washington worked a little bit but who was well respected there
7184706 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7184707 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7184708 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7184709 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7184710 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7184711 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7184712 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7184713 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7184714 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7184715 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7184716 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7184717 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7184718 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7184719 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7184720 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7184721 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7184722 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7184723 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7184724 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7184725 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7184726 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7184727 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7184728 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7184729 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7184730 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7184731 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7184732 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7184733 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7184734 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7184735 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7184736 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7184737 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7184738 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7184739 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7184740 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7184741 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7184742 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7184743 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7184744 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7184760 youre in a small space with great amenities and the resources of the city
7184761 what its doing is providing middle income housing without a subsidy
7184762 a small business needs to be so conscious of cash flow
7184763 to keep more of the profits for us thats just a good way to be
7184764 at the end of the day we did this for financial reasons
7184765 extremely important not to overlook the insurance value that the position provides
7184766 the purpose of our hedging is not to try to win a las vegas style bet it is to reduce risk associated with fuel price volatility by buying a form of insurance against a potentially harmful price increase

7184785 less risky borrowers will have to absorb the costs posed by riskier borrowers if issuers cant price everyone based on the risk they pose
7184786 now more than ever we need to end unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices that make it difficult for consumers to control their credit and manage their debt
7184787 instead of teasing people with low introductory rates giving cards to anyone who breathes and then hitting them with fees and penalties on the back end lenders can still price for risk they just have to do it on the front end
7184788 ive since decided to simply use cash and only use a credit card as a last resort
7184789 the first thing that made me laugh out loud was that he was putting on a stage version of erin brockovich in the school
7184790 have you ever considered doing a play that wasnt a popular movie
7184791 i know who this guy is i knew he was probably very very earnest but slightly misguided
7184792 often when i work with people ive got to like their stuff i tend to pick up on their rhythms and their tone so i start doing comedy thats slightly more in sync with whoever it is im working with
7184793 i thought it was smart and funny without being overly cynical
7184794 you dont meet people like him in comedy but you do meet people like him in theater and drama that kind of soul searching angst ridden neurosis you encounter in hollywood and california
7184795 it wasnt really anyone specific you kind of just get a feel think of a voice and dress a certain way
7184796 it made it kind of energetic and it gave it a vibrancy it wasnt lots and lots of bitter twisted middle aged people
7184797 theres a kind of enthusiasm they had that was infectious to me and yes which was really catchy and helps to give an energy
7184798 i think americans started to adapt things like the office have translated so well and caught peoples imaginations americas a big country you cant make generalizations about it the way that you can i think about england actually but americas so disparate theres an audience for esoteric interesting comedy
7184799 were more conversant in american culture than the americans are with british culture because weve grown up on a diet of american entertainment
7184800 weve got a lot more in common with america than we have with our european neighbors because we dont share the language and so we have a historical cultural connection but in terms of pop culture were much much closer to america
7184801 why are all those guys dressed in jeans vest tops and looking like jesus

7184808 thats the way it goes we keep talking about rivalries we might have one now too bad we tore up the car after the race i guess he wasnt happy about it
7184809 its racing we cant give up points when theyre there to take
7184810 i like my spotter he is a good guy but man thats ridiculous
7184811 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i heard clear clear clear went up and there was still someone there i am pretty upset about it there were a lot of people that got involved in that which shouldnt have been involved at all because it shouldnt have happened
7184812 michael waltrip is the worst driver in nascar period i cant believe napa signed back on
7184813 its a shame that we got caught in that mess we had a really good car
7184814 thats the risk you run at bristol i love racing here its a great place with great fans its just a bad race for us
7184815 some guys got together in front of me and the guy behind me didnt get checked up and drilled me you need to look past your hood you look in front you tend not to hit stuff i was trying to be smart and really cautious and it didnt do me any good i got wrecked anyway
7184816 its a typical bristol wreck wrong place wrong time but im happy with the way the car ran

7184843 you certainly didnt have a director there who was encouraging people to tell it like they saw it and to bring all information to the top so it could fairly be evaluated
7184844 i really cant understand why this hasnt gotten some attention

7184856 george tenet has tried to run away from the letter that several of us drafted decrying his book and calling upon him to give back the proceeds at least some of the proceeds from his advance to the soldiers and the families of soldiers who were killed or wounded in iraq because in my view and our view the man has blood on his hands he had a chance if he would have spoken up he could have stopped this rush to war he chose to remain silent but not just remain silent he chose to be an active participant in a deception that was carried out not only against other u s government officials but against the american people
7184857 either george tenet is lying through his teeth or tyler drumheller is lying through his teeth the chief of the european division for cia with regard to one of the most important pillars of secretary powells presentation at the united nations the mobile biological laboratories
7184858 george tenet is an apparatchik im not impressed with george tenet he should never have been cia director but how did colin powell a military officer a chairman of the joint chiefs get taken in by the aluminum tubes which was driven by a kid a young kid engineer by the name of joe turner at the cia who stood up somehow to all of the phd scientists of the weapons labs and department of energy because foley alan foley the head of winpac at cia wanted this argument out there to make the case for war i think powell could have stopped this

7184863 well be spending most of our time with 5 scots but well also be going out with the royal irish regiment and the afghan national army
7184864 to see whether the sacrifice they made was actually worth it if this is a situation thats winnable how long this situation will go on and to get to meet 5 scots
7184865 its very hard to win when youve got no air support in modern warfare that said theyre doing a pretty good job lets not underestimate the tenacity and cunning of the taliban theyve been fighting for many years
7184866 if you know the land you have an advantage and they clearly know the land very well
7184867 the wars changed in that the taliban are using far more ieds and anti personnel mines you dont have to feed an anti personnel mine you dont have to feed an ied
7184868 anyone who says theyre not scared would be bull ing
7184869 a lot of the casualties dont actually happen on the front
7184870 we chose 5 scots for a variety of reasons theyre very much at the sharp end of pushing back the taliban and opening up that area around musa qala
7184871 musa qala is stategically very important for the operation thats going on now
7184872 look we know we have an incomprehensible messy system that even we ourselves barely understand but instead of actually fixing the problems and making our operating systems better well just staple another layer on top to hide the ugliness

7184917 in the millennium when the kingdom of god is established on the earth in power glory and perfection and the reign of wickedness that has so long prevailed is subdued the saints of god will have the privilege of building their temples and of entering into them becoming as it were pillars in the temples of god see revelation 3 12 and they will officiate for their dead

7184920 temple work cannot be done in heaven but must be done on earth
7184921 the use of our approximately 400 years of records and the use of temples must be a training ground for us preparing the church for the time when this temple work will be our major assignment using the experience already gained
7184922 as to records being kept on the other side the lord never did work that man could do for himself
7184923 we must do all we can here and now to do this genealogical work which sometimes does appear to be inefficient and expensive but which the lord through joseph smith said was the

7184930 to lose yourself in righteous service to others can lift your sights and get your mind off personal problems or at least put them in proper focus
7184931 work is our blessing not our doom we should work at taking care of the spiritual mental social and physical needs of ourselves and those whom we are charged to help in the church of jesus christ there is plenty of work to do to move forward the kingdom of god every member a missionary family genealogy and temple work home evenings receiving a church assignment and magnifying it are but a few of our required labors

7184935 in a particularly stressful time or in the anticipation of a critical event one can seek for a blessing under the hands of the priesthood the sacrament will bless the souls d amp c 20 77 79 of all those who worthily partake of it
7184936 periodic fasting can help clear up the mind and strengthen the body and the spirit to make a fast most fruitful it should be coupled with prayer and meditation and its a blessing if one can ponder on the scriptures and the reason for the fast
7184937 the fellowship of true friends who can hear you out share your joys help carry your burdens and correctly counsel you is priceless
7184938 inspiring music may fill the soul with heavenly thoughts move one to righteous action or speak peace to the soul elder boyd k packer has wisely suggested memorizing some of the inspiring songs of zion to help crowd out debilitating depressive thoughts
7184939 there are times when you simply have to righteously hang on and outlast the devil until his depressive spirit leaves you
7184940 while you are going through your trial you can recall your past victories and count the blessings that you do have with a sure hope of greater ones to follow if you are faithful
7184941 every accountable child of god needs to set goals short and long range goals a man who is pressing forward to accomplish worthy goals can soon put despondency under his feet and once a goal is accomplished others can be set up
7184942 many problems may require only one or two of these solutions
7184943 many things have taken place during the past one hundred and thirty six years to impress faithful members of the church with the fact that the coming of the lord is near
7184944 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come
7184945 and i will show it plainly as i showed it unto my disciples as i stood before them in the flesh and spake unto them saying as ye have asked of me concerning the signs of my coming in the day when i shall come in my glory in the clouds of heaven to fulfil the promises that i have made unto your fathers
7184946 and when the light shall begin to break forth it shall be with them like unto a parable which i will show you
7184947 ye look and behold the fig trees and ye see them with your eyes and ye say when they begin to shoot forth and their leaves are yet tender that summer is now nigh at hand
7184948 even so it shall be in that day when they shall see all these things then shall they know that the hour is nigh
7184949 and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people
7184950 saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters
7184951 now as to the actual work of restoration what angel performed this mighty deed this work which involves the salvation of all men on earth in these latter days who restored the everlasting gospel was it one angel or many
7184952 thus the angel moroni brought the message that is the word but other angels brought the keys and priesthood the power and in the final analysis the fulness of the everlasting gospel consists of all of the truths and powers needed to enable men to gain a fulness of salvation in the celestial heaven
7184953 behold the time has fully come which was spoken of by the mouth of malachi testifying that he elijah should be sent before the great and dreadful day of the lord come
7184954 to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse
7184955 therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the lord is near even at the doors
7184956 blow ye the trumpet in zion and sound an alarm in my holy mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the lord cometh for it is nigh at hand
7184957 the era in which we live is the fullness of times spoken of in scriptures from the day that the father and the son manifested themselves to the boy joseph there has been a tremendous cascade of enlightenment poured out upon the world the vision of joel has been fulfilled
7184958 before christ comes a people have got to be prepared by being sanctified before the lord
7184959 now when i look at these things i also look at what there is before us the organizations which have been established in this church from the beginning are all helps and governments and are associated together to carry out this great work the eyes of the heavens are over us the son of god and all the prophets and patriarchs that have lived upon the earth are watching over this great work this great organization preparing for the coming of the son of man
7184960 chapter 24 preparing for the second coming of jesus christ
7184961 obedience to the gospel will save the world from sin abolish war strife and litigation an
7184962 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints regards it as part of its mission to prepare the way for the literal and glorious coming of the son of god to the earth to reign over it and dwell with his people
7184963 those who have received the gospel in the world will be factors in carrying out gods purposes
7184964 it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it
7184965 i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you to zion and i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding
7184966 the lord decreed a decree which he said his people should realize that they should begin from that very hour to prevail over all their enemies and inasmuch as they continued to be faithful in keeping his laws he had given unto them it was decreed that they should prevail until all enemies were subdued not subdued by violence or the spirit of contention or of warfare but subdued by the power of eternal truth by the majesty and power of almighty god the increased power of the righteous and of the upright covenanted people of god should be magnified and increased until the world shall bow and acknowledge that jesus is the christ and that there is a people preparing for his coming in power and glory to the earth again see d amp c 103 5 8
7184967 it is our habit in the church a habit born of slovenly study and a limited perspective to think of the restoration of the gospel as a past event and of the gathering of israel as one that though still in process is in large measure accomplished
7184968 but the restoration of the wondrous truths known to adam enoch noah and abraham has scarcely commenced
7184969 the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high
7184970 if we are on the lords errand we are entitled to the lords help never forget that truth that divine help of course is predicated upon our worthiness each must ask are my hands clean is my heart pure am i a worthy servant of the lord
7184971 we should never permit ourselves to do anything that we are not willing to see our children do we should set them an example that we wish them to imitate
7184972 when parents try to teach their children to avoid danger it is no answer for parents to say to their children
7184973 this entire people have become as a city upon a hill which cannot be hid
7184974 to the sophistry of satan jesus turned his back to the duty designated by his father he turned his face pledged his heart and gave his life and what a sinless selfless noble and divine life it was jesus labored jesus loved jesus served jesus testified what finer example could we strive to emulate
7184975 for behold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man
7184976 love one another as i have loved you by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another
7184977 behold i am jesus christ whom the prophets testified shall come into the world
7184978 to stand as witnesses of him at all times and in all things and in all places
7184979 earths crammed with heaven and every common bush afire with god but only he who sees takes off his shoes the rest sit round it and pluck blackberries
7184980 that christ will reign personally upon the earth and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisaical glory
7184981 the millennium is the thousand year period when jesus will reign on the earth at the beginning of this period of time the righteous will be caught up to meet jesus at his coming his coming will
7184982 the good people who have died will rise from their graves and meet him as he comes from heaven the wicked will not rise from their graves until after a period of 1 000 years
7184983 he will complete the resurrection those who have obtained the privilege of coming forth in the resurrection of the just will rise from their graves they will be caught up to meet the savior as he comes down from heaven
7184984 after jesus christ rose from the dead other righteous people who had died were also resurrected
7184985 after the beginning of the millennium those who will receive a terrestrial glory will be resurrected see d amp c 88 99 76 71 80 when all these people have been resurrected the first resurrection will be completed
7184986 the wicked who are living at the time of the second coming of the lord will be destroyed in the flesh they along with the wicked who are already dead will have to wait until the end of the millennium before they can come forth from their graves at the end of the millennium the second resurrection will take place all of the remaining dead will rise to meet god they will either inherit the telestial kingdom or be cast into outer darkness with satan see d amp c 76 32 33 81 112
7184987 there will be no disease and there will be no death when people become old they will not die as we do now they will change in an instant from the way we are now to an immortal condition which means they will never die again
7184988 even though mortals will live on the earth during the millennium they will not have diseases as we do now there will be no death as we know it when people have lived to an old age they will not die and be buried instead they will be changed from their mortal condition to an immortal condition in an instant see d amp c 63 51 101 29 31
7184989 satan only gains power over man through mans exercise of his own agency and when satan shall be bound as the lord says he will be for a thousand years one of the great powers that will help bring this to pass will be mans agency
7184990 the time is not far distant when great judgments will be poured out upon the wicked inhabitants of the earth every prophet who has looked forward to our day has seen and predicted that the wicked would be destroyed their destruction means the destruction of satans power the righteous will be left and because of their righteousness the lord will have mercy upon them they exercising their agency in the right direction will bring down his blessings upon them to such an extent that satan will be bound
7184991 because of the righteousness of his people satan has no power wherefore he cannot be loosed for the space of many years for he hath no power over the hearts of the people for they dwell in righteousness and the holy one of israel reigneth
7184992 yea verily i say unto you in that day when the lord shall come he shall reveal all things 33 things which have passed and hidden things which no man knew things of the earth by which it was made and the purpose and the end thereof 34 things most precious things that are above and things that are beneath things that are in the earth and upon the earth and in heaven
7184993 whatsoever any man shall ask it shall be given unto him
7184994 and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
7184995 reveal all things things which have passed and hidden things which no man knew things of the earth by which it was made and the purpose and the end thereof things most precious things that are above and things that are beneath things that are in the earth and upon the earth and in heaven
7184996 all animals even those that are now enemies will live together in peace they will no longer fight with each other
7184997 the animal kingdom will also be at peace all animals even those that are now enemies will live together in harmony animals that now eat flesh will eat grass and grain see isaiah 11 6 7
7184998 during the millennium there will be no war people will live in peace and harmony together everything that has been used for war will be turned to useful purposes they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more isaiah 2 4
7184999 during the millennium the earth will be as it was when adam and eve lived in the garden of eden there will be no war jesus will rule both the church and the government
7185000 it will be a great privilege to live during the millennium things we do not now understand will become clear to us life will be very much as it is now except that everything will be done in love and peace people will continue to have and raise children plant and harvest crops and build houses
7185001 during the millennium mortals will still live on earth and they will continue to have children as we do now see d amp c 45 58
7185002 brigham young taught that there will be nonmembers of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints living on earth as well as members people will still have their agency and for a time many will continue to believe their false religions and ideas eventually everyone will accept jesus christ as the savior
7185003 for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem
7185004 the earth will again be as it was when adam and eve lived in the garden of eden see articles of faith 1 10 the whole earth will be a delightful garden there will not be different continents as we have now but the land will be gathered in one place as it was in the beginning see d amp c 133 23 24
7185005 in many ways life will be much as it is now except that everything will be done in righteousness people will eat and drink and will wear clothing see discourses of brigham young p 115 people will continue to plant and harvest crops and build houses see isaiah 65 21
7185006 we have visions of the welfare program we have great visions of the redemption of zion and the building of the new jerusalem the inauguration of the united order the coming of the millennium but before these visions materialize we must travel some rough roads
7185007 we know from the scriptures that zion must be established again before the savior comes and we know from scripture that the law of consecration is the law upon which zion will operate
7185008 it is my conviction that we cannot begin too early in life to prepare to live the law of consecration we know of the second coming of the savior we do not know the day nor the hour but we know he will come again we also know that although there is still much to be done prior to his coming many prophecies are being fulfilled today we also know that we must be prepared to live the law of consecration prior to his coming
7185009 the millennium will be a time of unity peace and temple service
7185010 the millennium consists in this every heart in the church and kingdom of god being united in one the kingdom increasing to the overcoming of everything opposed to the economy of heaven and satan being bound and having a seal set upon him
7185011 let the people be holy and the earth under their feet will be holy let the people be holy and filled with the spirit of god and every animal and creeping thing will be filled with peace the soil of the earth will bring forth in its strength and the fruits thereof will be meat for man the more purity that exists the less is the strife the more kind we are to our animals the more will peace increase and the savage nature of the brute creation vanish away if the people will not serve the devil another moment whilst they live if this congregation is possessed of that spirit and resolution here in this house is the millennium let the inhabitants of this city be possessed of that spirit let the people of the territory be possessed of that spirit and here is the millennium let the whole people be possessed of that spirit and here is the millennium and so will it spread over all the world dby 115 16
7185012 listening to the music its amazing how it can do it give me the strength and the power the will and the influence to better myself and fix my mistakes prepares my life for the day things will change embrace reality becuase love comes from uncertainty molded into trust its always gotten through to me kindness and beauty are a couple of your virtues but your flaws are another thing that i love about you i really wish i could say it to you every day without its meaning seeming to you to just weather away cause i told you i am here for your help ill take my seat while you try and fix it yourself
7185013 it seems the past 100 nights have butchered my hope and my restless eyes left for lonesome inside of my room while the suns rays themselves cant disperse my gloom
7185014 one appearance will be to the righteous saints who have gathered to the new jerusalem here in america in this place of refuge they will be safe from the wrath of the lord which will be poured out without measure on all nations
7185015 and the glory of the lord shall be there and the terror of the lord also shall be there insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it and it shall be called zion
7185016 and it shall come to pass among the wicked that every man that will not take his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto zion for safety
7185017 and there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another
7185018 not many years hence there shall be another gathering of high priests and righteous souls in this same valley of adam ondi ahman
7185019 in this council christ will take over the reins of government officially on the earth and the kingdom and dominions and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the saints of the most high
7185020 until this grand council is held satan shall hold rule in the nations of the earth but at that time thrones are to be cast down and mans rule shall come to an end then shall he give the government to the saints of the most high
7185021 another appearance of the lord will be to the jews
7185022 and it shall cleave in twain and the earth shall tremble and reel to and fro and the heavens also shall shake
7185023 the lord himself will then rout the gentile armies decimating their forces see ezek
7185024 what are these wounds in thine hands and in thy feet
7185025 i will say unto them these wounds are the wounds with which i was wounded in the house of my friends i am he who was lifted up i am jesus that was crucified i am the son of god
7185026 and then shall they weep because of their iniquities then shall they lament because they persecuted their king d amp c 45 51 53
7185027 what a touching drama this will be jesus prophet messiah king will be welcomed in his own country
7185028 yet another appearance of christ will be to the rest of the world here is his description of his coming
7185029 the lord shall be red in his apparel and his garments like him that treadeth in the wine vat
7185030 and so great shall be the glory of his presence that the sun shall hide his face in shame and the moon shall withhold its light and the stars shall be hurled from their places
7185031 and the lord shall utter his voice and all the ends of the earth shall hear it and the nations of the earth shall mourn and they that have laughed shall see their folly
7185032 and calamity shall cover the mocker and the scorner shall be consumed and they that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into the fire
7185033 when the savior spoke of these signs and prophecies to his disciples in jerusalem they were apprehensive
7185034 be not troubled for when all these things shall come to pass ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled
7185035 his christs next appearance after coming to his temple will be among the distressed and nearly vanquished sons of judah at the crisis of their fate when the hostile troops of several nations are ravaging the city and all the horrors of war are overwhelming the people of jerusalem he will set his feet upon the mount of olives which will cleave and part asunder at his touch attended by a host from heaven he will overthrow and destroy the combined armies of the gentiles and appear to the worshipping jews as the mighty deliverer and conquerer so long expected by their race and while love gratitude awe and admiration swell their bosoms the deliverer will show them the tokens of his crucifixion and disclose himself as jesus of nazareth whom they had reviled and whom their fathers put to death then will unbelief depart from their souls and the blindness in part which has happened unto israel be removed
7185036 all the prophets speak of this day and when that time comes the lord is going to come out of his hiding place you can see what a terrible condition it is going to be and the jews besieged not only in jerusalem but of course throughout palestine are in the siege and when they are about to go under then the lord comes there will be the great earthquake the earthquake will not be only in palestine there will not be merely the separation of the mount of olives to form a valley that the jews may escape but the whole earth is going to be shaken there will be some dreadful things take place and some great changes are going to take place and that you will find written in the book of ezekiel 38 17 23
7185037 three natural changes in the earth all apparently growing out of one transcendent happening are here named revelation 16 17 21 as attending our lords second coming they are
7185038 1 earths land masses shall unite islands and continents shall become one land
7185039 2 every valley shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low the rugged terrain of today shall level out into a millennial garden
7185040 3 such an earthquake as has never been known since mans foot was planted on this planet shall attend these changes in the earths surface and appearance
7185041 the time will come when every knee will bow and every tongue confess to and acknowledge him and when they who have lived upon the earth and have spurned the idea of a supreme being and of revelations from him will fall with shamefacedness and humble themselves before him exclaiming there is a god
7185042 what will they do they will hear of the wisdom of zion and the kings and potentates of the nations will come up to zion to inquire after the ways of the lord and to seek out the great knowledge wisdom and understanding manifested through the saints of the most high dby 113
7185043 they will have to bow the knee and confess that he is god and that jesus christ who suffered for the sins of the world is actually its redeemer that by the shedding of his blood he has redeemed men women children beasts birds fish the earth itself and everything that john saw and heard praising in heaven see revelation 5 13 dby 113
7185044 some years ago one of our brethren spoke of the payment of tithing as
7185045 it will be a time of great and terrible fears of cataclysmic upheavals of nature of weeping and wailing d amp c 19 5 of repentance that comes too late and of crying out unto the lord for mercy but for those who in that judgment are found acceptable it will be a day for thanksgiving for the lord shall come with his angels and the apostles who were with him in jerusalem and those who have been resurrected further the graves of the righteous will be opened and they shall come forth see d amp c 88 97 then will begin the great millennium d amp c 43 30 period of a thousand years when satan shall be bound and the lord shall reign over his people can you imagine the wonder and the beauty of that era when the adversary shall not have influence think of his influence upon you now and reflect on the peace of that time when you will be free from such influence there will be quiet and goodness where now there is contention and evil
7185046 in the morning at 4 oh clock i was awoke by brother davis knocking at my door saying brother joseph come git up and see the signs in the heavens and i arrose and beheld to my great joy the stars fall from heaven yea they fell like hail stones a litteral fullfillment of the word of god as recorded in the holy scriptures and a sure sign that the coming of christ is clost at hand
7185047 do you think there is calamity abroad now among the people not much all we have yet heard and all we have experienced is scarcely a preface to the sermon that is going to be preached when the testimony of the elders ceases to be given and the lord says to them come home i will now preach my own sermons to the nations of the earth all you now know can scarcely be called a preface to the sermon that will be preached with fire and sword tempests earthquakes hail rain thunders and lightnings and fearful destruction you will hear of magnificent cities now idolized by the people sinking in the earth entombing the inhabitants the sea will heave itself beyond its bounds engulphing mighty cities famine will spread over the nations
7185048 a series of most unusual events happened within the past few weeks of course the most startling was the mt st helens eruption with all its damage and toll of human life
7185049 but while it was belching forth a series of tornadoes swept through the middle section of the united states
7185050 it is important that we look for significance in these upheavals can it be that they are signs of the times can it be that the lord is speaking by these frightful disasters
7185051 he said that in the latter days he would declare his testimony by means of tempests floods earthquakes and epidemics
7185052 we have a tendency to forget our pains quickly even as does a mother when her child is born little is said even now about the arizona floods although the debris and broken bridges remain
7185053 even the volcano is off the front pages and the 50 tornadoes in one day they got only two inches of space on the front page as part of a news summary not so much as a headline was given them
7185054 it is possible to become so hardened that we brush aside the warning voice and even forget our sufferings those who lost their homes and loved ones wont easily forget though even if the general public does
7185055 must the lord speak in louder tones must he send greater disasters before we listen to his warning voice
7185056 how much does it take to waken us to a realization that god is real that there is an end to his patience and that the only true security in these troubled times is through obedience to the most high why fly in the face of providence
7185057 the revelation to store food may be as essential to our temporal salvation today as boarding the ark was to the people in the days of noah
7185058 we can begin ever so modestly we can begin with a one weeks food supply and gradually build it to a month and then to three months i am speaking now of food to cover basic needs as all of you recognize this counsel is not new but i fear that so many feel that a long term food supply is so far beyond their reach that they make no effort at all
7185059 i realize this is an unpleasant topic on which to dwell
7185060 but to an otherwise gloomy picture there is a bright side the coming of our lord in all his glory his coming will be both glorious and terrible depending on the spiritual condition of those who remain
7185061 do not be too anxious for the lord to hasten his work
7185062 whether the world is going to be burned up within a year or within a thousand years does not matter a groat a kernel of grain to you and me
7185063 we have the kingdom of god to build up zion to redeem we have to sanctify ourselves so that we may be prepared to be caught up with the church of the firstborn and if we improve every day and hour then if we die we shall be found justified
7185064 the lords time is not for me to know but he is kind long suffering and patient and his wrath endureth silently and will until mercy is completely exhausted and then judgment will take the reins i do not know how neither do i at present wish to know it is enough for us to know how to serve our god and live our religion and thus we will increase in the favor of god dby 117 18
7185065 the lord jesus christ is coming to reign on earth the world may say that he delays his coming until the end of the earth but they know neither the thoughts nor the ways of the lord the lord will not delay his coming because of their unbelief and the signs both in heaven and earth indicate that it is near the fig trees are leafing in sight of all the nations of the earth see joseph smith matthew 1 38 40 and if they had the spirit of god they could see and understand them
7185066 chapter 24 preparing for the second coming of jesus christ
7185067 for nearly six thousand years god has held you in reserve to make your appearance in the final days before the second coming every previous gospel dispensation has drifted into apostasy but ours will not god has saved for the final inning some of his strongest children who will help bear off the kingdom triumphantly and that is where you come in for you are the generation that must be prepared to meet your god make no mistake about it you are a marked generation there has never been more expected of the faithful in such a short period of time as there is of us each day we personally make many decisions that show where our support will go the final outcome is certain the forces of righteousness will finally win what remains to be seen is where each of us personally now and in the future will stand in this fight and how tall we will stand will we be true to our last days foreordained mission
7185068 stand in holy places and be not moved until the day of the lord come
7185069 for a defense and for a refuge from the storm and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth
7185070 but now we are coming of age as a church and as a people we have attained the stature and strength that are enabling us to fulfill the commission given us by the lord through the prophet joseph smith that we should carry the glad tidings of the restoration to every nation and to all people
7185071 and not only shall we preach the gospel in every nation before the second coming of the son of man but we shall make converts and establish congregations of saints among them
7185072 i have asked of the lord concerning his coming and the lord gave a sign and said in the days of noah i set a bow in the heavens as a sign that in any year that the bow should be seen the lord would not come but there should be seed time and harvest during that year but whenever you see the bow withdrawn it shall be a token that there shall be famine pestilence and great distress among the nations and that the coming of the messiah is not far distant i prophesy in the name of the lord that christ will not come this year as father miller has prophesied for we have seen the bow and i also prophesy that christ will not come in forty years and if god ever spoke by my mouth he will not come in that length of time jesus christ never did reveal to any man the precise time that he would come and all that say so are false teachers
7185073 whether the half hour here spoken of is according to our reckoning thirty minutes or whether it be according to the reckoning of the lord we do not know we know that the word hour is used in some portions of the scriptures to represent quite a lengthy period of time for instance we the latter day saints are living in the eleventh hour that is in the eleventh period of time and for aught we know the half hour during which silence is to prevail in heavens may be quite an extensive period of time
7185074 if this measurement refers strictly to the lords time one thousand of mans years to one day for the lord the half hour would be approximately twenty one years elder pratt continued
7185075 during the period of silence all things are perfectly still no angels flying during that half hour no trumpets sounding no noise in the heavens above but immediately after this great silence the curtain of heaven shall be unfolded as a scroll is unfolded
7185076 suffice it to say the jews gather home and rebuild jerusalem
7185077 the messiah comes convulses the earth overthrows the army of the gentiles delivers the jews cleanses jerusalem cuts off all wickedness from the earth raises the saints from the dead brings them with him and commences his reign of a thousand years during which time his spirit will be poured out upon flesh men and beasts birds and serpents will be perfectly harmless and peace and the knowledge and glory of god shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea and the kingdom and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the saints of the most high
7185078 these two shall be followers of that humble man joseph smith through whom the lord of heaven restored the fulness of his everlasting gospel in this final dispensation of grace
7185079 these prophets will have power to pronounce great judgments upon the earth see revelation 11 5 6
7185080 they shall have power like elijah who called down fire from heaven to consume his enemies and who sealed the heavens that it rained not in all israel for the space of three and a half years 1 kings 17 and 18 2 kings 1 and like moses by whose word blood and plagues lay heavily upon the egyptians
7185081 john in the eleventh chapter of revelation gives us many more particulars concerning this same event
7185082 after a struggle of three years and a half they gogs army will at length succeed in destroying these two prophets and then overrunning much of the city they will send gifts to each other because of the death of the two prophets and in the meantime will not allow their dead bodies to be put in graves but will suffer them to lie in the streets of jerusalem three days and a half during which time the armies of the gentiles consisting of many kindreds tongues and nations passing through the city plundering the jews will see their dead bodies lying in the street
7185083 represent those church members who are looking for the bridegroom to come and the oil filled lamps are symbolic of the holy spirit which lights the way before the saints
7185084 and five of them were wise and five were foolish
7185085 elder mcconkie further explains that this parable is not about
7185086 in the parable only those with oil in their lamps were able to enter the house of the bridegroom in modern times only those worthy of a temple recommend may enter the house of the lord
7185087 at midnight precisely at the darkest hour when least expected the bridegroom came when the world is full of tribulation and help is needed but it seems the time must be past and hope is vain then christ will come
7185088 now those who have got oil in their lamps are men who live their religion pay their tithing pay their debts keep the commandments of god and do not blaspheme his name men and women who walk in the light of the lord men and women who will not sell their birthright for a mess of pottage or for a little gold or silver these are those that will be valiant in the testimony of jesus christ
7185089 five of them were wise and five were foolish for when the lord of heaven comes in power and great glory to reward every man according to the deeds done in the body if he finds one half of those professing to be members of his church prepared for salvation it will be as many as can be expected judging by the course that many are pursuing
7185090 while the bridegroom has tarried we have all slumbered and slept as a church and kingdom we have slumbered and slept and the word of the lord to me is that we have slept long enough and we have the privilege now of rising and trimming our lamps and putting oil in our vessels this is the word of the lord to me
7185091 chapter 24 preparing for the second coming of jesus christ
7185092 now the question is how can we keep oil in our lamps
7185093 who is going to be prepared for the coming of the messiah those who enjoy the holy ghost and live under the inspiration of the almighty who abide in jesus christ and bring forth fruit to the honor and glory of god no other people will be
7185094 chapter 24 preparing for the second coming of jesus christ
7185095 heed the lords counsel to the saints of this dispensation
7185096 this preparation must consist of more than just casual membership in the church you must learn to be guided by personal revelation and the counsel of the living prophet so you will not be deceived our lord has indicated who among church members will stand when he appears
7185097 and at that day when i shall come in my glory shall the parable be fulfilled which i spake concerning the ten virgins
7185098 for they that are wise and have received the truth and have taken the holy spirit for their guide and have not been deceived verily i say unto you they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire but shall abide the day d amp c 45 56 59
7185099 but oh what a wonderful time to be young you have knowledge of many more things than we needed to have it is my conviction that your generation is better and stronger than was ours better in many ways i have faith that you young men and young women can meet the world on its own terms and conquer it
7185100 if you are to preserve your blessings it is not enough for you to just be free and independent to capitalize on your advantages so that they accrue to your well being and prosperity
7185101 will you be among those who are faithful to the end
7185102 what if the day of his coming were tomorrow if we knew that we would meet the lord tomorrow through our premature death or through his unexpected coming what would we do today what confessions would we make what practices would we discontinue what accounts would we settle what forgivenesses would we extend what testimonies would we bear if we would do those things then why not now why not seek peace while peace can be obtained if our lamps of preparation are drawn down let us start immediately to replenish them we need to make both temporal and spiritual preparation for the events prophesied at the time of the second coming and the preparation most likely to be neglected is the one less visible and more difficult the spiritual a 72 hour kit of temporal supplies may prove valuable for earthly challenges but as the foolish virgins learned to their sorrow a 24 hour kit of spiritual preparation is of greater and more enduring value
7185103 some of the brethren approached president wilford woodruff and inquired of him as to when he felt the end would be when would be the coming of the master these i think are not his exact words but they convey the spirit of his reported reply i would live as if it were to be tomorrow but i am still planting cherry trees i think we may well take this as a page for our own book and live as if the end might be tomorrow and still plant cherry trees in worrying about things that are beyond our reach we should not overlook our opportunities with our own families and friends in worrying about possible eventualities we should not neglect the things that need to be done here and now and that are within our reach
7185104 how do you prepare for the second coming well you do not worry about it you just live the kind of life that if the second coming were to be tomorrow you would be ready
7185105 i want to work to live not live to work
7185106 katanya sambil goyang2 kan tangan keatas sudah gak sabar bentar2 njerit trus pindah duduk sana sini liatin paketnya mau dibuka
7185107 abandoning the chance for first by walking toward the dugout
7185108 a batter who does not realize his situation on a third strike not caught and who is not in the process of running to first base shall be declared out once he leaves the dirt circle surrounding home plate
7185109 i was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the son of man when i heard a voice repeat the following 15 joseph my son if thou livest until thou art eighty five years old thou shalt see the face of the son of man therefore let this suffice and trouble me no more on this matter 16 i was left thus without being able to decide whether this coming referred to the beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing or whether i should die and thus see his face 17 i believe the coming of the son of man will not be any sooner than that time
7185110 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father
7185111 i the lord god have spoken it but the hour and the day no man knoweth neither the angels in heaven nor shall they know until he comes
7185112 and he that believeth shall be blest with signs following even as it is written
7185113 and again it shall come to pass that on as many as ye shall baptize with water ye shall lay your hands and they shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and shall be looking forth for the signs of my coming and shall know me
7185114 and i will show it plainly as i showed it unto my disciples as i stood before them in the flesh and spake unto them saying as ye have asked of me concerning the signs of my coming in the day when i shall come in my glory in the clouds of heaven to fulfil the promises that i have made unto your fathers
7185115 the precise time of christs coming has not been made known to man by learning to comprehend the signs of the times by watching the development of the work of god among the nations and by noting the rapid fulfillment of significant prophecies we may perceive the progressive evidence of the approaching event his coming will be a surprise to those who have ignored his warnings and who have failed to watch
7185116 the greatest events that have been spoken of by the holy prophets will come along so naturally as the consequence of certain causes that unless our eyes are enlightened by the spirit of god and the spirit of revelation rests us we will fail to see that these are the events predicted by the holy prophets and so with the great events that will take place in the future they will come along in so natural a manner the lord will bring them to pass in such a way that they will not be accepted by the people except by those who can comprehend the truth as the fulfillment of the predictions of the prophets
7185117 one more matter there are among us many loose writings predicting the calamities which are about to overtake us
7185118 are you aware of the fact that we need no such publications to be forewarned if we were only conversant with what the scriptures have already spoken to us in plainness
7185119 let me give you the sure word of prophecy on which you should rely for your guide instead of these strange sources which may have great political implications
7185120 read the 24th chapter of matthew particularly that inspired version as contained in the pearl of great price
7185121 then read the 45th section of the doctrine and covenants where the lord not man has documented the signs of the times
7185122 now turn to section 101 and section 133 of the doctrine and covenants and hear the step by step recounting of events leading up to the coming of the savior
7185123 finally turn to the promises the lord makes to those who keep the commandments when these judgments descend upon the wicked as set forth in the doctrine and covenants section 38
7185124 brethren these are some of the writings with which you should concern yourselves rather than commentaries that may come from those whose information may not be the most reliable and whose motives may be subject to question and may i say parenthetically most of such writers are not handicapped by having any authentic information on their writings
7185125 treasure up the lords word possess it own it make it yours by both believing it and living it for instance the voice of the lord says that if men have faith repent and are baptized they shall receive the holy ghost it is not sufficient merely to know what the scripture says one must treasure it up meaning take it into his possession so affirmatively that it becomes a part of his very being as a consequence in the illustration given one actually receives the companionship of the spirit obviously such persons will not be deceived where the signs of the times and the second coming of the messiah are concerned
7185126 chapter 24 preparing for the second coming of jesus christ
7185127 zion the new jerusalem will be built upon the american continent articles of faith 1 10 the lord designated jackson county missouri as the land of zion a place where the saints of joseph smiths day would gather and where the holy city of zion would eventually be built chapter 15 establishing the cause of zion
7185128 i cannot learn from any communication by the spirit to me that zion has forfeited her claim to a celestial crown notwithstanding the lord has caused her to be thus afflicted except it may be some individuals who have walked in disobedience and forsaken the new covenant all such will be made manifest by their works in due time i have always expected that zion would suffer some affliction from what i could learn from the commandments which have been given but i would remind you of a certain clause in one which says that after much tribulation cometh the blessing see d amp c 58 4 by this and also others and also one received of late i know that zion in the due time of the lord will be redeemed but how many will be the days of her purification tribulation and affliction the lord has kept hid from my eyes and when i inquire concerning this subject the voice of the lord is be still and know that i am god
7185129 the building up of zion is a cause that has interested the people of god in every age it is a theme upon which prophets priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live
7185130 anyplace where the saints gather is zion which every righteous man will build up for a place of safety for his children
7185131 there will be here and there a stake of zion for the gathering of the saints there your children shall be blessed and you in the midst of friends where you may be blessed the gospel net gathers of every kind chapter 15 establishing the cause of zion
7185132 before christ comes a people have got to be prepared by being sanctified before the lord
7185133 chapter 24 preparing for the second coming of jesus christ
7185134 the city of zion spoken of by david in the one hundred and second psalm will be built upon the land of america and the ransomed of the lord shall return and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads isaiah 35 10 and then they will be delivered from the overflowing scourge that shall pass through the land
7185135 we ought to have the building up of zion as our greatest object the time is soon coming when no man will have any peace but in zion and her stakes
7185136 the church which administers the gospel and the saints who have received the gospel must be independent of all the powers of earth as they work out their salvation temporally and spiritually with fear and trembling before the lord
7185137 be it remembered that tribulations lie ahead there will be wars in one nation and kingdom after another until war is poured out upon all nations and two hundred million men of war mass their armaments at armageddon
7185138 peace has been taken from the earth the angels of destruction have begun their work and their swords shall not be sheathed until the prince of peace comes to destroy the wicked and usher in the great millennium
7185139 there will be earthquakes and floods and famines the waves of the sea shall heave themselves beyond their bounds the clouds shall withhold their rain and the crops of the earth shall wither and die
7185140 there will be plagues and pestilence and disease and death
7185141 their flesh shall fall from off their bones and their eyes from their sockets
7185142 bands of gadianton robbers will infest every nation immorality and murder and crime will increase and it will seem as though every mans hand is against his brother
7185143 we need not dwell more upon these things we are commanded to search the scriptures where they are recounted with force and fervor and they shall surely come to pass
7185144 it is one of the sad heresies of our time that peace will be gained by weary diplomats as they prepare treaties of compromise or that the millennium will be ushered in because men will learn to live in peace and to keep the commandments or that the predicted plagues and promised desolations of latter days can in some way be avoided
7185145 we must do all we can to proclaim peace to avoid war to heal disease to prepare for natural disasters but with it all that which is to be shall be
7185146 knowing what we know and having the light and understanding that has come to us we must as individuals and as a church use our talents strengths energies abilities and means to prepare for whatever may befall us and our children
7185147 we know that the world will go on in wickedness until the end of the world which is the destruction of the wicked
7185148 as the saints of the most high we shall strive to
7185149 relying always on the lord we must become independent of the world we must be self reliant using the agency god has given us we must work out our own economic and temporal problems
7185150 we do know of course that the city of enoch will return in the millennial day to join with the earthly zion then built up by mortals
7185151 when christ comes the political kingdom will be given to the church the lord is going to make an end to all nations that means this nation as well as any other the kingdom of god is the church but during the millennium the multitudes upon the face of the earth who are not in the church will have to be governed and many of their officers who will be elected may not be members of the church
7185152 we are informed in the revelation given to joseph smith the prophet that the city of zion and the new jerusalem is one and the same d amp c 28 9 42 9 45 66 67 57 2 58 7
7185153 jerusalem of old after the jews have been cleansed and sanctified from all their sin shall become a holy city where the lord shall dwell and from whence he shall send forth his word unto all people
7185154 the work which has been accomplished in the last days is one of vast importance and will call into action the energy skill talent and ability of the saints so that it may roll forth with that glory and majesty described by the prophet and will consequently require the concentration of the saints to accomplish works of such magnitude and grandeur
7185155 the work of gathering spoken of in the scriptures will be necessary to bring about the glories of the last dispensation
7185156 what was the object of gathering the people of god in any age of the world the main object was to build unto the lord a house whereby he could reveal unto his people the ordinances of his house and the glories of his kingdom and teach the people the way of salvation it is for the same purpose that god gathers together his people in the last days to build unto the lord a house to prepare them for the ordinances and endowments washings and anointings
7185157 this gathering of israel and this budding of zion in the last days occurs in stages
7185158 in an area conference held in mexico city in 1972 bruce r
7185159 the revealed words speak of there being congregations of covenant people of the lord in every nation speaking every tongue and among every people when the lord comes again
7185160 the place of gathering for the mexican saints is in mexico the place of gathering for the guatemalan saints is in guatemala the place of gathering for the brazilian saints is in brazil and so it goes throughout the length and breadth of the whole earth
7185161 it is to be done by missionary work it is your responsibility to attend to this missionary work
7185162 the coming forth of the book of mormon is a sign to the entire world that the lord has commenced to gather israel and fulfill covenants he made to abraham isaac and jacob
7185163 the book of mormon is central to this work it declares the doctrine of the gathering 19 it causes people to learn about jesus christ to believe his gospel and to join his church in fact if there were no book of mormon the promised gathering of israel would not occur
7185164 this gathering of israel and this budding of zion in the last days occurs in stages
7185165 from the time of the destruction of jerusalem by titus until the year 1917 jerusalem was trodden down of the gentiles
7185166 we see today a miracle being performed before our eyes
7185167 the british government changed all of this when they obtained the mandate
7185168 canals have been built for irrigation and the jordan has been changed from its natural channel into channels or into canals on each side of the original stream these irrigate some seven million acres which could not be under cultivation otherwise hydro electric stations have been built on these streams
7185169 there is a tendency among men to explain away what they dont wish to understand in literal simplicity and we as latter day saints are not entirely free from the taint of that tendency some people say that prediction is to be explained in this way a gathering is in progress and has been in progress from the early days of this church and thus the lost tribes are now being gathered but that we are not to look for the return of any body of people now unknown as to their whereabouts true the gathering is in progress this is a gathering dispensation but the prophecy stands that the tribes shall be brought forth from their hiding place and their scriptures shall become one with the scriptures of the jews the holy bible and with the scriptures of the nephites the book of mormon and with the scriptures of the latter day saints as embodied in the volumes of modern revelation
7185170 when shalmanezer overran the kingdom of israel about 721 b
7185171 in due course the lost tribes of israel will return and come to the children of ephraim to receive their blessings
7185172 the spirit of the lord fell upon joseph in an unusual manner and he prophesied that john the revelator was then among the ten tribes of israel who had been led away by shalmaneser king of assyria to prepare them for their return from their long dispersion to again possess the land of their fathers
7185173 the tribes shall come they are not lost unto the lord they shall be brought forth as hath been predicted and i say unto you there are those now living aye some here present who shall live to read the records of the lost tribes of israel which shall be made one with the record of the jews or the holy bible and the record of the nephites or the book of mormon even as the lord hath predicted and those records which the tribes lost to man but yet to be found again shall bring shall tell of the visit of the resurrected christ to them after he had manifested himself to the nephites upon this continent
7185174 god is determined to raise up prophets among that people but he will not bestow upon them all the fulness of the blessings of the priesthood the fulness will be reserved to be given to them after they come to zion
7185175 again here are the ten tribes of israel we know nothing about them only what the lord has said by his prophets
7185176 how long will they who come from the north countries tarry in the heights of zion sometime they have got to raise wheat cultivate the grape wine and oil raise flocks and herds and their souls will have to become as a watered garden they will dwell in zion a good while and during that time there will be twelve thousand chosen out of each of these ten tribes besides twelve thousand that will be chosen from judah joseph and the remaining tribes one hundred and forty four thousand in all see revelation 7 4 8 d amp c 77 11 chosen for what to be sealed in their foreheads for what purpose so that the power of death and pestilence and plague that will go forth in those days sweeping over the nations of the earth will have no power over them these parties who are sealed in their foreheads will go forth among all people nations and tongues and gather up and hunt out the house of israel wherever they are scattered and bring as many as they possibly can into the church of the first born preparatory to the great day of the coming of the lord one hundred and forty four thousand missionaries quite a host all this has got to take place
7185177 by and by when all things are prepared when the jews have received their scourging and jesus has descended upon the mount of olives the ten tribes will leave zion and will go to palestine to inherit the land that was given to their ancient fathers and it will be divided amongst the descendants of abraham isaac and jacob by the inspiration of the holy ghost
7185178 and in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars and the whole earth shall be
7185179 and the love of men shall wax cold and iniquity shall abound
7185180 the progress of the church will be paralleled by a growing wickedness among mankind in proportion to the spread of the gospel among the nations of the earth so would the power of satan rise
7185181 we are living in the prophesied time when peace shall be taken from the earth when all things shall be in commotion and mens hearts shall fail them there are many temporal causes of commotion including wars and natural disasters but an even greater cause of current commotion is spiritual viewing our surroundings through the lens of faith and with an eternal perspective we see all around us a fulfillment of the prophecy that the devil shall have power over his own dominion evil that used to be localized and covered like a boil is now legalized and paraded like a banner the most fundamental roots and bulwarks of civilization are questioned or attacked nations disavow their religious heritage marriage and family responsibilities are discarded as impediments to personal indulgence
7185182 now the lord has withdrawn his spirit from the world
7185183 now because of the wickedness of the world that spirit has been withdrawn and when the spirit of the lord is not striving with men the spirit of satan is therefore we may be sure that the time has come spoken of in section 1 of the doctrine and covenants peace has been taken from the earth the devil has power over his own dominion the spirit of the lord has been withdrawn not because the lord desires to withdraw that spirit but because of the wickedness of mankind it becomes necessary that this spirit of the lord be withdrawn
7185184 we live in a season when fierce men do terrible and despicable things we live in a season of war we live in a season of arrogance we live in a season of wickedness pornography immorality all of the sins of sodom and gomorrah haunt our society our young people have never faced a greater challenge we have never seen more clearly the lecherous face of evil
7185185 no one need tell you that we are living in a very difficult season in the history of the world standards are dropping everywhere nothing seems to be sacred any more i do not know that things were worse in the times of sodom and gomorrah we see similar conditions today they prevail all across the world i think our father must weep as he looks down upon his wayward sons and daughters
7185186 much of the world is being engulfed in a rising river of degenerate filth with the abandonment of virtue righteousness personal integrity traditional marriage and family life sodom and gomorrah was the epitome of unholy life in the old testament it was isolated then now that condition is spread over the world satan skillfully manipulates the power of all types of media and communication his success has greatly increased the extent and availability of such degrading and destructive influences worldwide
7185187 nothing happened in sodom and gomorrah which exceeds in wickedness and depravity that which surrounds us now words of profanity vulgarity and blasphemy are heard everywhere unspeakable wickedness and perversion were once hid in dark places now they are in the open even accorded legal protection at sodom and gomorrah these things were localized now they are spread across the world and they are among us
7185188 i know of nothing in the history of the church or in the history of the world to compare with our present circumstances nothing happened in sodom and gomorrah which exceeds the wickedness and depravity which surrounds us now satan uses every intrigue to disrupt the family the sacred relationship between man and woman husband and wife through which mortal bodies are conceived and life is passed from one generation to the next generation is being showered with filth profanity vulgarity blasphemy and pornography are broadcast into the homes and minds of the innocent unspeakable wickedness perversion and abuse not even exempting little children once hidden in dark places now seeks protection from courts and judges
7185189 the world is rapidly coming to its end that is the end of the days of wickedness
7185190 god has held the angels of destruction for many years lest they should reap down the wheat with the tares but i want to tell you now that those angels have left the portals of heaven and they stand over this people and this nation now and are hovering over the earth waiting to pour out the judgments and from this very day they shall be poured out calamities and troubles are increasing in the earth and there is a meaning to these things remember this and reflect upon these matters if you do your duty and i do my duty well have protection and shall pass through the afflictions in peace and in safety
7185191 one day while i was sitting in the presence of my father president joseph f
7185192 this will be astonishing to you i am sure and i copied this from the literary digest of january 20 1934
7185193 two scientists charting the european record find that the indexed number of wars rose from 2 678 in the twelfth to 13 735 98 in the twentieth century
7185194 does war tend to decline as nations become more civilized
7185195 now of course he had reference to the war from 1914 to 1918
7185196 each was studied from five points of view the duration of the war the size of the fighting force the number of casualties including killed and wounded the number of countries involved and the proportion of the combatants to the total population of the belligerent nations
7185197 now thats the quotation then in 1936 i made these remarks
7185198 out of this study these scientists declare that they have discovered that war has tended to increase over all europe in the late centuries
7185199 if prophecy is to be fulfilled there awaits the world a conflict more dreadful than any the world has yet seen progress of man pp 402 404
7185200 now i want to make some comments in regard to the statement by president woodruff and this parable
7185201 the lord said that the sending forth of these angels was to be at the end of the harvest and the harvest is the end of the world
7185202 what do we gather out of that that we are at the time of the end this is the time of the harvest this is the time spoken of which is called the end of the world
7185203 and the lord shall be red in his apparel and his garments like him that treadeth in the wine vat
7185204 isaiah has pictured this great day when the lord shall come with his garments or apparel red and glorious to take vengeance on the ungodly isa 64 1 6 this will be a day of mourning to the wicked but a day of gladness to all who have kept his commandments do not let anyone think that this is merely figurative language it is literal and as surely as we live that day of wrath will come when the cup of iniquity is full we have received a great many warnings the great day of the millennium will come in the wicked will be consumed and peace and righteousness will dwell upon all the face of the earth for one thousand years
7185205 and again this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come or the destruction of the wicked
7185206 and there shall be earthquakes also in divers places and many desolations yet men will harden their hearts against me and they will take up the sword one against another and they will kill one another
7185207 those with refined senses find it difficult to conceive of the desolation destruction and death that will prevail during the final great battles ushering in christs reign of peace
7185208 i know these are unpleasant things it is not a pleasant thing even for me to stand here and tell you that this is written in the scriptures if the lord has a controversy with the nations he will put them to the sword their bodies shall lie unburied like dung upon the earth that is not nice is it but should we not know it is it not our duty to read these things and understand them dont you think the lord has given us these things that we might know and we might prepare ourselves through humility through repentance through faith that we might escape from these dreadful conditions that are portrayed by these ancient prophets that is why i am reading them i feel just as keenly as you do about the condition and i pray for it to come to an end but i want it to come to an end right
7185209 it is not a figure of speech that is meaningless or one not to be taken literally when the lord speaks of the burning all through the scriptures we have the word of the lord that at his coming the wicked and the rebellious will be as stubble and will be consumed isaiah has so prophesied surely the words of the lord are not to be received lightly or considered meaningless
7185210 the earth will soon be reaped that is the wicked must soon be destroyed from off the face of the earth for the lord hath spoken it and who can stay the hand of the lord or who is there that can measure arms with the almighty for at his commands the heavens and the earth must pass away
7185211 there will be a great division of the people the saints then will have become very numerous probably more numerous than ever before and they will be obliged to gather together in one place as we now do from the four quarters of the earth satan will gather his army he with his army will come against the saints and the beloved city and encompass them round about his army will be so great that it will be able to come upon the saints on all sides he is to encompass their camp because of the favorable position he is to hold in that great last battle and because of the vast number of his army he doubtless believes that he will get the mastery and subdue the earth and possess it i do not think he fully understands all about the designs of god
7185212 not rebel in ignorance or dwindle in unbelief as the lamanites did but they will sin wilfully against the law of heaven and so great will the power of satan be over them that he will gather them together against the saints and against the beloved city and fire will come down out of heaven and consume them
7185213 it does not mean that this earth shall pass away and another take its place and the heaven thereof shall pass away and another heaven take its place but that the earth and its heaven shall after passing away through death be renewed again in immortality
7185214 so we see that the lord intends to save not only the earth and the heavens not only man who dwells upon the earth but all things which he has created the animals the fishes of the sea the fowls of the air as well as man are to be re created or renewed through the resurrection for they too are living souls

7185307 behind the olympics theres a whole other race going on

7185362 insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible
7185363 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7185364 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7185365 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7185366 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7185367 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7185368 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7185369 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7185370 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7185371 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7185372 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7185373 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7185374 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7185375 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7185376 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7185377 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7185378 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7185379 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7185380 try to use that word or those words more often
7185381 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7185382 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need

7185387 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7185388 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7185389 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7185390 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7185391 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7185392 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7185393 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7185394 de aankomstlijn ligt op quasi dezelfde plaats als tijdens de tweede rit in de tour de france van dit jaar de finish wordt wel uit de andere richting aangesneden en is licht hellend de wijziging van de aankomstplaats heeft natuurlijk gevolgen voor het parkoers de ziel van de koers blijft zeker behouden met veel hellingen en kasseien we kiezen voor een vlakke aanloop over zowat zeventig kilometer bedoeling is dat er de komende jaren steeds gestart wordt op het sint pietersplein maar aangezien de halfvastenfoor daar op 1 maart plaatsvindt wijken we dit jaar uit naar het smak van daar uit gaat het richting destelbergen beervelde lokeren overmere naar zottegem waar na 73 kilometer wedstrijd met grotenberge de eerste van elf hellingen ligt wat verder volgt een brakels vierluik met de beklimmingen van de leberg berendries valkenberg en de tenbosse de hellingen worden afgerond met een heel intensief stukje waarin de molenberg de afsluiter is na 160 kilometer van daaruit gaat het vlak maar wel over tal van kasseiwegen voor nog een afstand van 39 kilometer naar de charles de kerckhovelaan onderschat vooral de steentjes aan de lange munt niet deze is met 2600 meter de langste kasseistrook van de wedstrijd er volgen dan nog 24 kilometer de laatste jaren hebben wij steevast een mooie winnaar op ons podium gehad het zal nu niet anders zijn
7185395 we waren er met de organisatoren snel uit om de omloop het volk opnieuw naar gent te halen
7185396 deze koers hoort hier immers thuis we kunnen dus na al die jaren gerust spreken van gent gent al horen de organisatoren liever de omloop het volk als benaming tradities zijn er om in ere te houden dus deze koers moest starten en finishen in gent
7185397 na de crash kun je niet meer pinnen stop maar vast wat euros in een oude sok want de dollar gaat vallen en sneller dan wij denken
7185398 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7185399 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7185400 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7185401 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7185402 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7185403 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7185404 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7185405 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7185406 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7185407 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past

7185409 want ik ben de heer een milde god vol medelijden vol liefde en geduld een god op wie je vertrouwen kunt
7185410 has a clear plan of action to address this national concern
7185411 it would appear that vested interest groups have been very effective in blocking efforts to approach this nationally
7185412 it may be that local and state initiatives will be the most fruitful methods for trialing models for expanding health care coverage i suspect getting around interest group barriers is more successful when addressed by local citizens who hold each other personally accountable for the decisions they make
7185413 if we can implement these recommendations we expect to save money in the long term
7185414 het ging geweldig we hebben met de chief custodian burgemeester kunnen spreken en uitleggen waarom we daar als vertegenwoordigers van de verzoeningscoalitie ook waren wij hadden een ingelijste apology statement meegebracht met geschenk
7185415 if i had a rocket launcher i would make somebody pay
7185416 i endorse an expansion of medicare as the best solution to our health care dilemma although there doesnt seem to be a lot of debate about that option
7185417 theres a lot of vested interest in our current system
7185418 people think all i need to have is insurance and if i have insurance everything is going to be fine that really isnt true how many people have insurance and theyre not happy
7185419 just because you have insurance doesnt mean youre going to get the care you need and the care you deserve
7185420 we have a mind set what the public expects is they want the best health care they want the best drugs they want the best technology they want it yesterday
7185421 and the irony is they want somebody else to pay for it and they want someone else to determine how much to pay for it
7185422 want geloven doen we met ons hart en daardoor vnden we rechtvaardiging belijden doen we met onze mond en dat brengt ons redding
7185423 i cant pay the rent but im fucking gorgeous tell me something i dont know
7185424 tell your boyfriend next time he around to buy his own weed and dont wear my shit down
7185425 someday theyre gonna carve two dates beneath my name in stone one for when i first arrived one for when i say good bye i cant change when i got here or when im going home but there is still a little time in the middle thats mine all mine the dash between the dates the gift weve all been given that little line that takes us from the cradle up to heaven youre born and then you die life goes by so fast and it s all riding on the dash
7185426 a chicago talk show host who held his feet to the fire
7185427 the only reason the word of faith conference was brought up on the air and at this blog is because i believe that people are being hurt by these teachings and i believe the men involved are perverting the gospel its not about me or ray and our feelings its supposed to about truth does everyone understand that
7185428 dont bother preaching the gospel because god will save who he will anyway so you might be lying to a person if you witness to them telling them that christ died for them but it could turn out theyre not elect so its not worth the risk
7185429 augustine or calvin or whitfield who in successive ages were the great exponents of the system of grace or what will he say of those puritans whose works are full of them
7185430 i got to speak with pam a woman who went up to leave a gift the size of her house payment at the feet of john avanzini that night she thought you were terrific she also thought avanzini who promised her that god was going to pay off her mortgage was terrific and she invited us back the next night to hear jesse duplantis she told us excitedly that crowds would be out the door for him im sure they were
7185431 we havent given him the best run support but every game we feel like we have a great chance to win when he pitches and again he pitched great today
7185432 it was good for us we knew that facility very well and it was nice and loud for us so we had that going but it was also about a lot of good players playing well and thats what we have to have at the new place
7185433 and obviously i knew you got to go on that ball the whole situation was the corners were in and you got to see the ball past the pitcher and not at the corners
7185434 i understand i made a mistake but i flinched for a second making sure it got past the pitcher and it wasnt at the corners and it wasnt a line drive getting caught i should have instead of flinching i should have been taking a step forward so i had momentum in the right direction i just made a mistake and i just have to learn from it i realize that
7185435 it will help me see more pitching more good pitching
7185436 hes been out a lot this year already with the injured right ankle he needs a few more at bats i think i would highly recommend it yes he can go down and work on his swing a little bit and work on the base stealing part of it again and make some improvements in that area i would think thats what he needs to do
7185437 i was pretty much working on driving the ball to right field it was something i was good at last year but not this year
7185438 vi overvejer det men har ikke besluttet os endnu jeg synes ikke at der er noget galt med navnet ny alliance det er stadig et fremragende navn og jeg ved ikke om det ender med at vi ndrer navn

7185440 im hoping he works this week and hoping he gets on the practice field kind of like andre johnson has done
7185441 chris i think would be very iffy still coming off the injection in his back i think it doesnt look very good for those two
7185442 we tried to push him last week and it wasnt responding as well as we would have liked
7185443 id like to see chester play this week i think he needs to
7185444 he wanted the ball we tried to get it to him early in the game
7185445 i told offensive coordinator kyle shanahan if we scored well go for two we felt good about our two point play
7185446 guys make mistakes and we have to deal with them when they happen
7185447 ill visit with jameel today were trying to evaluate him as a player what hes done in camp and where were headed as a team
7185448 i think hes going to be a fine player but right now a lot of things are coming his way
7185449 in a nation where evangelical protestantism and other religious traditions stress a literal reading of the biblical description of gods individually creating each species students often arrive at school fearing that evolution and perhaps science itself is hostile to their faith
7185450 their abiding mistrust in evolution he feared jeopardized their belief in the basic power of science to explain the natural world and their ability to make sense of it themselves
7185451 campbell defended his fellow writers against complaints that they had not included alternative explanations for lifes diversity like intelligent design
7185452 faith is not based on science and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks but i do expect you to understand it
7185453 the question that asked for evidence of evolutionary change had been answered
7185454 have improved in many states since 2000 b ut most states standards do not explicity require teachers to explain that humans evolved from earlier life forms

7185489 has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe to be affected by allahs reminder and that which has been revealed of the truth lest they become as those who received the scripture before and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened and many of them were rebellious disobedient faasiqoon
7185490 o messenger of allah should i recite to you and it was revealed to you
7185491 i recited soorat an nisaaa until i reached the ayah
7185492 how will it be then when we bring from each nation a witness and we bring you o muhammad as a witness against these people
7185493 i saw the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam praying with us and i heard the sound of his weeping coming out of his chest which was like the sound of a boiling pot
7185494 during his illness the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said order abu bakr to lead the prayer
7185495 those who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of allah verily in the remembrance of allah do hearts find rest
7185496 the believers are only those who when allah is mentioned feel a fear in their hearts and when his verses this quran are recited unto them they increase their faith and they put their trust in their lord alone

7185509 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7185510 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7185511 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it
7185512 now that weve come through whats the excuse to keep the third boat out or the 10th boat or the 100th we did break the economic siege of gaza
7185513 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7185514 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7185515 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7185516 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7185517 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7185518 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7185519 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7185520 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7185521 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react

7185524 im in favor of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free
7185525 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7185526 insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible
7185527 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7185528 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7185529 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7185530 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7185531 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7185532 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7185533 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7185534 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7185535 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7185536 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile

7185539 so many minority youths had volunteered that there was literally no room for patriotic folks like himself
7185540 i am angry that so many of the sons of the powerful and well placed
7185541 i dont oppose all wars what i am opposed to is a dumb war i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world

7185565 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7185566 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7185567 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7185568 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7185569 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him

7185577 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7185578 but that day is at least 10 years away perhaps as long as 15 20 years away
7185579 so more nuclear power has to be part of the equation
7185580 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7185581 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing
7185582 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7185583 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7185584 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7185585 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7185586 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
7185587 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
7185588 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
7185589 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
7185590 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
7185591 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
7185592 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
7185593 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
7185594 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
7185595 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
7185596 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
7185597 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
7185598 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
7185599 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
7185600 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
7185601 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
7185602 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
7185603 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
7185604 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
7185605 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
7185606 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
7185607 indian gaming has provided economic development not only just for tribes
7185608 it also does have some spillover effects to the rest of the economy
7185609 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7185610 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7185611 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7185612 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7185613 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7185614 he has a mental illness but he was very fit from the time of arrest to the time being brought into police custody hes collapsed and died weve not been told why
7185615 we are being upright as a family and we have come down here ourselves to find answers
7185616 they went off so quickly in the first kilometre i deliberately backed off the pace
7185617 but i always thought more athletes would start coming back and they did
7185618 im a little disappointed not to make the top 20 but you can only do what you can maybe i didnt get my pacing quite right but im satisfied with the run
7185619 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired when i slow down
7185620 in kenya we have many medals but im glad to have this one it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7185621 it was incredible what the africans managed to do in those last 10km
7185622 but not all transactions occur at the same time the person providing the service may not need anything in return at that time when they do thats when they pay the 15 percent
7185623 its an interesting and eclectic group of people who need something and the exchange makes everyone an equal
7185624 someone always feels like they didnt get something of equal value for what they did
7185625 we give customers instant credit for their services they can spend the next day and in this economy that can work out better than waiting to get paid also you can barter with anyone in the group the person you did work for might not have what you want but another member will
7185626 the worse the economy gets the more businesses want to barter why pay for something in cash if you can trade for it instead
7185627 people dont join out of the goodness of their hearts people who join need something
7185628 it gives you an opportunity to find clients you normally wouldnt be able to find
7185629 it also gives you opportunities to move inventory you might not be able to move otherwise
7185630 the exchange may not be for everybody but it definitely works for me
7185631 i still have to do a cash business i cant pay employees with barter dollars but im very happy with the exchange all of them
7185632 i want to include companies in this area and be part of the growth sometimes it seems like people arent moving in theyre moving away i grew up in boston and never knew the southcoast existed but once i saw it i loved it
7185633 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determinate guidelines for law enforcement
7185634 the people of the azores and the commonwealth share a long rich history dating back to the 18th century
7185635 azoreans have contributed to our economy our culture and our lives in massachusetts and we are richer for it
7185636 this signing is an act of profound historical and political meaning
7185637 azorean immigrants and their sons and grandsons who are born here are true ambassadors of our traditions culture and the azorean sentiment
7185638 geography has made us neighbors history has made us friends
7185639 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
7185640 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
7185641 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
7185642 we just dont have as much money as we used to
7185643 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
7185644 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
7185645 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
7185646 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
7185647 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
7185648 we are not staying home with our children by default
7185649 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
7185650 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
7185651 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
7185652 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
7185653 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
7185654 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
7185655 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
7185656 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
7185657 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
7185658 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
7185659 im trying to work out a baby sitting swap arrangement with friends
7185660 if it works well go and see the new batman movie maybe
7185661 twenty five years is a very long time in the world of technology
7185662 i grew up navigating with loran c that had numbers and lines and it used to go beep
7185663 now we are seeing gps with embedded cartography to see the whole of cape cod with all the bathymetric lines that we used to fish on as well as seeing where your boat is relative to any structure its just mind blowing
7185664 even in the past five years the advances have been incredible
7185665 now were dealing with 3 d rendering of bottom composition and top down satellite overlays so you can fade in and out that gives the angler a perspective from multiple sources on top of the basic navigational chart
7185666 in the u s were definitively a fishing company and a lot of our business is in the freshwater market now
7185667 there is so much potential there you show a coastal boater our chart and because the technology is familiar he says thats nice show it to the inland guy and he wants to know where to get one customers are now buying their hardware based on whether or not it will run our chip
7185668 the future is very exciting for us because there is such a demand from people for the ability to access data more easily and we are still cutting edge development wise
7185669 que se haga tu voluntad y no la m a
7185670 i think this kind of sportsmanship and brotherhood is really remarkable
7185671 what touched me most was the attitude of this american shooter
7185672 conceived and developed with the vision of a better neighborhood for all to enjoy
7185673 i wish they would care about the problems crime drugs and cleaning the streets
7185674 the water could not get in to the system quick enough
7185675 new bedford has spent nearly 200 million to upgrade its sewage collection and treatment facilities and now shellfish and swimmers are making a comeback
7185676 developmentally they become self absorbed and unaware of what is around them including their education
7185677 as kids go through that period of time their bodies are changing their minds are changing and their identity becomes very important to them
7185678 social and peer pressure plays a large part in their motivation rather than what their parents and authorities at school think
7185679 for most teachers who went into elementary education math was not their favorite subject
7185680 we are asking people who maybe didnt like math themselves to give more students critical thinking in mathematics
7185681 we want to find things kids can do after school that are safe and where they have supervision things for their mental entertainment instead of going home and vegging out and playing video games
7185682 teachers meet regularly to talk about any issues that students are having with programs
7185683 i think they know them well and can talk about not only academic issues but social issues you dont find that in high school
7185684 meet the energy demands of students and to try to keep them engaged in things that are interesting to them
7185685 it gives us the ability to teach to their needs
7185686 they review the math curriculum so they are not losing ground
7185687 in mathematics when you see what they are asked to do there is so much vocabulary so many concepts you have to get through language
7185688 we saw a definite impact last year with what we are doing with mathematics
7185689 we have high hopes that they will improve this year
7185690 if they find the right ingredient we know they will improve
7185691 they have to stay focused and parents have to make sure school is number one in their life
7185692 i think homeowners increasingly recognize that its in their best interest to have energy efficient products
7185693 people come in and their first question is should i switch to a front loader
7185694 they like the technology and when you sweeten it by saying theyll be using less water and energy then it closes the deal in their mind
7185695 reverse mortgages may benefit some senior investors by unlocking their home equity but they should only be entered into carefully and with a complete understanding of the consequences
7185696 i presume he was sucked down into it and he was overcome by the rush of waters
7185697 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7185698 this wont be much at all if a storm doesnt have a category in front of it doesnt worry us much
7185699 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7185700 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7185701 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7185702 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7185703 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7185704 the creature has always been out there and its out there still
7185705 if you travel the ancient trails even today theres a good chance youll meet him
7185706 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
7185707 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
7185708 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
7185709 i think most people today know this is just a story
7185710 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
7185711 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
7185712 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
7185713 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
7185714 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
7185715 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
7185716 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
7185717 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
7185718 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
7185719 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small

7185721 hell say he doesnt want to race that way like he always does
7185722 it wasnt much of a pass to me well see what hes got to say when he gets wrecked
7185723 well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7185724 i had to ask if hed do that to me and he has before
7185725 thats the way it goes we keep talking about rivalries we might have one now too bad we tore up the car after the race i guess he wasnt happy about it
7185726 its racing we cant give up points when theyre there to take
7185727 i like my spotter he is a good guy but man thats ridiculous
7185728 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i heard clear clear clear went up and there was still someone there i am pretty upset about it there were a lot of people that got involved in that which shouldnt have been involved at all because it shouldnt have happened
7185729 michael waltrip is the worst driver in nascar period i cant believe napa signed back on
7185730 its a shame that we got caught in that mess we had a really good car
7185731 thats the risk you run at bristol i love racing here its a great place with great fans its just a bad race for us
7185732 some guys got together in front of me and the guy behind me didnt get checked up and drilled me you need to look past your hood you look in front you tend not to hit stuff i was trying to be smart and really cautious and it didnt do me any good i got wrecked anyway
7185733 its a typical bristol wreck wrong place wrong time but im happy with the way the car ran
7185734 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7185735 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7185736 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7185737 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7185738 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7185739 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7185740 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7185741 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7185742 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7185743 a skeptics guide to here the document is available in pdf format by chapter
7185744 as an architect we can specify a light fixture and then get back from a supplier and find oh thats a two month wait and it costs 4 000 but now that stuff is available off the shelf its available at home depot
7185745 you put more money into the insulation it pays back in three to five years
7185746 the journal suggests that for every dollar saved in energy related operating costs the assessed values increased by 20
7185747 at no time were we given the ok to really go nuts here
7185748 we could have spent quite a bit more on the hvac everything that we did was just a slightly different and green direction of normal decisions
7185749 we provided a few more windows in daylighting and insisted upon air to air heat exchange we were able to prove to them the value of that
7185750 we immediately presented that there would be real value in providing a space that was clean and used less energy those were the two things that we really focused on a clean interior that has plenty of fresh air in it that doesnt out gas pollutants
7185751 what i liked was the natural lighting and the windows which made it a welcoming place and an easier place to work in
7185752 being a yank i want to reuse existing buildings theyre there i dont want to throw them away but some of them may have to go
7185753 lots of commercial or municipal types of buildings are just not conducive to renovation because of circulation ada compliance and contemporary code
7185754 the southeastern new england area especially the southcoast is one of the last to respond to new technology
7185755 thats good and thats bad its good because a lot of these technologies need a couple of cycles of installation and failure in order for them to iron out the bugs
7185756 the building industry is responding and its nice i have a sense of pride in the industry because were doing it with no government intervention
7185757 rockland trust continues to perform well compared to our peer group
7185758 our 100 plus years of experience have positioned us well
7185759 such sound business practices have earned high praise from the industry
7185760 weve got great lenders and sound practices but the real key to our success has been our customers weve been here for generations and are the largest publicly traded bank headquartered in massachusetts people know us they trust us with their business and we have a history of exemplary personalized service they want we live and work alongside our customers and are an integral part of the communities in which we do business thats the real reason for our success
7185761 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7185762 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7185763 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7185764 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7185765 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7185766 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7185767 i have no doubt that there really are real terrorists out there but she isnt one of them
7185768 shes a dangerous person with a lot of ability and the investigation will show how far along she may have been with any plot
7185769 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7185770 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7185771 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7185772 suggest a need for clearer more consumer friendly terms and conditions
7185773 if you dont know when youre going to be hit with a rate increase or why well thats a good solid reason for mistrust
7185774 its essential that things need to be said in really plain language
7185775 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7185776 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7185777 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7185778 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7185779 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7185780 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7185781 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7185782 we need to avoid any semblance of improper conduct even though no one has been accused
7185783 we are confident that de castro will put the party ahead of his personal interests
7185784 those who say that this doesnt affect a political career is naive
7185785 this is a process that no one wants and much less 72 days before the elections
7185786 puerto ricos government has a lack of credibility and is losing prestige
7185787 i just want to stay home watch tv and eat ice cream
7185788 this is our first time going to the store and i still have a son in fifth grade to shop for
7185789 im going back sept 4 which is still kind of early but its not august
7185790 august is a summer month september sounds a lot better
7185791 ive made a few friends since i moved up here but ill get to know more people now and the schools are a lot better im pretty excited to go back
7185792 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7185793 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7185794 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7185795 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7185796 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7185797 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7185798 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7185799 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7185800 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7185801 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7185802 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7185803 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7185804 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business
7185805 but then apply the same general principles to grades 10 through 12 so students arent faced with the same problems but just a year later
7185806 as a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people in a time of soaring costs for energy health care and other needs
7185807 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
7185808 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
7185809 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
7185810 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
7185811 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
7185812 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
7185813 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
7185814 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
7185815 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call
7185816 a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people
7185817 theres a lot of people kind of groping in the semidarkness
7185818 trying to figure out what a post reagan post bush republican party looks like
7185819 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
7185820 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
7185821 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
7185822 and we dont have a lot of time to be building things
7185823 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7185824 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7185825 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7185826 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7185827 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7185828 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7185829 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7185830 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7185831 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7185832 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7185833 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
7185834 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
7185835 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
7185836 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
7185837 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
7185838 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
7185839 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
7185840 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
7185841 push questions of who i was out of my mind
7185842 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
7185843 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
7185844 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
7185845 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
7185846 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
7185847 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
7185848 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
7185849 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
7185850 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
7185851 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
7185852 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
7185853 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
7185854 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
7185855 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
7185856 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
7185857 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
7185858 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
7185859 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
7185860 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
7185861 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7185862 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7185863 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems
7185864 al haber encontrado sumamente dif cil mantener una relaci n normal ante la constante intromisi n en nuestras vidas privadas hemos decidido con tristeza tomar rumbos separados
7185865 nuestro alejamiento es amigable y ambos nos guardamos gran afecto
7185866 para cualquier pareja es dif cil separarse pero hacerlo ante la mirada del p blico y con una hijita de por medio es sumamente agobiante
7185867 esperamos por el bien de nuestra peque a hija que se nos dar cierto espacio y tiempo para superar esta dif cil etapa
7185868 los medios a veces insin an que hay una divisi n entre mis hijos y heather pero en realidad nos llevamos muy bien y quienes conocen a nuestra familia pueden ver esto por s mismos
7185869 then you find out rather late in the day whether your calculations have been right or not
7185870 first ill take a few weeks to look over the code then ill sit down with bill gates and tell the one about the pope and two blind jews at liquor store
7185871 far more secure than the 32 bit version and the 64 bit version contains a security feature called address space layout randomizer which causes a random offset to be applied when system files are loaded this randomization foils many of the exploits that are commonly used against windows xp
7185872 i maybe could have played were just trying to be precautionary right now not trying to go out there and push it it counts but at the same time its preseason right now just trying to get better so my aim is to be 100 percent
7185873 its sore a little bit but its a lot better than it was when i first hurt it a lot better than it was when i woke up sunday morning but i still have a little ways to go and still have to treat everything
7185874 hopefully not but if i have to i will hopefully i can be to the point by the first game where i wont have to wear a brace at all
7185875 i really dont know im just taking it day by day
7185876 i would have loved to play today and possibly thursday but it didnt workout like that if im able to play id love to
7185877 probably making cuts its different things like that thats pretty much it straight ahead stuff is fine
7185878 probably the running more than anything dropping back i can do it to the point where there is no pain especially with the brace on i really dont feel it its kind of uncomfortable but its stability
7185879 it wasnt hard at all i wasnt ready to the point where under these circumstances i really wasnt ready to play
7185880 it was frustrating when i first got hurt then when i figured out what it was i probably have a little ways to go just to get to 100 percent first game is probably the only game that youll be 100 percent its kind of in jeopardy now im probably not able to be 100 percent for the first game of the season so its kind of hard
7185881 i really dont care about that stuff stuff ive been getting is stuff that i really cant control there are different things that you control but ligaments and cartilage and stuff like that you really cant control that stuff so i really dont care about that label at all
7185882 we took him out there he warmed up before the game and as late as 6 20 i made him come and sit down with me and told him tell me exactly where you are at i told you we were going to treat it just like a regular season game i said what can you do and what cant you do what can you do in this game plan and what cant you do its important that you have that honesty in fact he could have played and could have played a certain way and certain menu of plays and probably had to stay in the pocket but thats not the prudent thing to do there may be a time when he has to play a game that way but i thought he did a good job of pushing to that and it only gets better here
7185883 im not thinking in that regard im thinking more of seeing those guys that are going to be here for that last cut and letting all those guys play together
7185884 it hurt i think williams readjusted my spine for me

7185915 i would like to thank all those who have offered their love and support
7185916 my main concern at the moment is the welfare of our family
7185917 i think its always important and this time perhaps its more important
7185918 because of sen mccains age and health history it means succession is more of a concern than it might otherwise be
7185919 and then there is sen obamas newness to public life and the concerns some people have as to whether hes ready
7185920 my view is that obamas pick has become more important because of mccains attacks about whether hes ready to lead or not
7185921 with international problems swirling around even as iraq recedes hes got to get his bona fides on national security in order
7185922 sen biden doesnt believe that sen obama is ready to serve as president
7185923 sen biden has long been a leading critic of sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience hes criticized sen obama for his lack of leadership and judgment on iraq afghanistan and his commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of rogue states

7185925 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said

7185927 this proposal should never have been given serious consideration greenpeace climate campaigner john hepburn said
7185928 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland mr hepburn said
7185929 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change
7185930 i dont envy ms bligh given the economic power of the greenhouse mafia but sometime soon she is going to have to make the tough decision to put the future of the state ahead of the vested interests of the coal lobby

7185934 i havent heard any complaints from the peacocks yet besides theyre extremely nasty birds and they keep beating me at checkers
7185935 peacocks are very seditious birds you know always trying to undermine you wearing brighter colors than you and pecking at your toes i never could stand them
7185936 so why do you have a palace full of them
7185937 the son of a shameless spittoon of a merchant deceived me

7185939 you know you are monkeying around with the blog too much and i cant keep up with your demands for template changes also i think you should be writing things that are a bit more upbeat one of your readers said as much and after long thought he might have a point dont you think
7185940 theyre always pestering me for things put up my comments answer my questions stop adding so many graphics to the template that they take 3 days to load next thing theyll want me to stop beheading them and mounting their heads to deter my enemies
7185941 no but i might start any time now now i want an all new template with four columns eight headers three separate comment options and a golden glow around it that radiates out of the monitor and into space
7185942 if you want it why dont you make it yourself buster
7185943 and darts dont throw themselves not unless i construct some sort of dart throwing machine or maybe just one that pretends to throw darts but pulls back at the last second
7185944 how many voices can you do again let me hear em

7185955 ive never done anything to your house after 10 30 uh well it was after 10 30 when you did this tonight and it was 11 25 when you wrapped my house in july in other words with that statement right there this kids credibility just went out the window
7185956 toch is de film niet louter mijn verhaal de voorbije vier jaar heb ik getracht het verhaal te objectiveren en universeler te maken
7185957 iedereen heeft de periode eind jaren 60 begin jaren 70 anders beleefd in my queen karo kijken we door de ogen van een kind het gaat dus om een zeer subjectieve kijk we hebben de meeste grote historische momenten uit de geschiedenis van de krakersbeweging omzeild het is niet de bedoeling om het amsterdamse krakersmilieu te schetsen daar zijn documentaires voor
7185958 het was een mooie turbulente tijd waarin heel veel gebeurde als kind heb ik die periode ervaren als spannend en verwarrend vandaag twijfel ik nog steeds het oppermachtige materia lisme van nu is ook niet alles in de film komen vader en moeder recht tegenover elkaar te staan hij zweert op het dogmatische af bij zijn idealen zij gaat meer in de richting van het kapitalisme de film geeft niemand gelijk en de filmmaakster weet het ook niet sorry
7185959 doroth e kwam zelf met het idee om hier te filmen
7185960 het is een schitterende locatie maar logistiek waren er toch heel wat problemen draaien moest tijdens de bouwvakvakantie water en elektriciteit waren een zorg we hebben valse muren laten optrekken en de binnenplaats volledig overkoepeld zodat we alles konden verduisteren we zitten namelijk met een aantal nachtsc nes maar kinderen mag je niet s nachts laten werken we hebben overigens ook een gediplomeerde kinderbegeleidster in dienst moeten nemen zij is de vertrouwenspersoon bij wie de kinderen te allen tijde terechtkunnen de regisseur heeft daar niet altijd de tijd voor zij moet meestal op duizend vragen tegelijk antwoorden de begeleidster zorgt ervoor dat de kinderen als eersten eten krijgen en voldoende kunnen ravotten of slapen ze zijn zot van haar ze geeft ook psychologische begeleiding en dat is geen luxe want we zitten bijvoorbeeld met een aantal naaktsc nes
7185961 nu ik met haar gewerkt heb weet ik het wel zeker ik kan me de film niet eens meer voorstellen met een ander kind ze teert niet op de dialogen ze speelt met heel haar lichaam haar positie vertelt wat er gebeurt
7185962 op een dag kwam ik haar tegen in de biowinkel den teepot in de kartuizersstraat ik had een coup de foudre dit is mijn karo ik ben haar gevolgd behoorlijk dutrou xiaans maar dat trok ik me even niet aan toen ik zag dat ze de dochter was van de choreografe anne teresa de keersmaeker was ik gerustgesteld ik zou haar makkelijk kunnen traceren de dag dat mijn film echt van de grond kwam maar toen het zover was was anna franziska eigenlijk al te oud voor de rol ik ben kinderen blijven casten zonder het contact met anna franziska te verbreken ik riep haar schandalig vaak terug de kogel was door de kerk toen ik inzag dat het personage gerust wat ouder mocht zijn de film bevat een paar sc nes die wel erg zwaar zijn voor een jong kind en ik wil vermijden dat de toeschouwer medelijden krijgt met dat kind dat moet zien te overleven in de boze vroege jaren zeventig
7185963 toen het er minder goed uitzag bleef ik mijn best doen
7185964 zelfs al werd ik niet gekozen het is altijd de moeite waard om iets te proberen
7185965 ook al lopen er op de set soms gestreste mensen rond en is het geen pretje als je winterkleren moet aantrekken terwijl het zo warm is ik vind dit nog altijd heel leuk binnen een paar dagen vertrekken we naar nederland er zijn een paar sc nes in het zwembad gepland zo zal ik toch nog een beetje vakantiegevoel hebben
7185966 het is zo al zo moeilijk om samen te leven laat staan als je het probeert met een boel vrienden en vreemden
7185967 whats he doing back there we never know what hes doing back there

7185969 the crops die farmers then have to plough and plant again
7185970 it is not moral for some people to go to bed with a full stomach when others go to bed with their stomach empty
7185971 all his spiritual strength derived from his trust in god while his deep eucharistic piety and devotion to our lady formed the basis for his life
7185972 please dont cry dont feel desperate dont be worried its the will of god i turn especially to you my dear mummy offer your pain to mary the mother
7185973 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7185974 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7185975 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7185976 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7185977 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7185978 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7185979 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7185980 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7185981 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7185982 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7185983 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7185984 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7185985 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7185986 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7185987 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7185988 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7185989 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7185990 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7185991 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7185992 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7185993 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7185994 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7185995 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7185996 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7185997 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7185998 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7185999 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7186000 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7186001 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7186002 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7186003 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7186004 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7186005 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7186006 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7186007 try to use that word or those words more often
7186008 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7186009 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7186010 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7186011 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7186012 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7186013 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7186014 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7186015 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7186016 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7186017 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7186018 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7186019 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7186020 baby you are the most gorgeous girl i have ever seen and i am so lucky to have you
7186021 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
7186022 i just have eruptions sometimes and i need your help to get me through those times im deeply sorry for all the inconveniences ive caused
7186023 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7186024 yo i got a new dance for yall america just crank back three times from left to right and say yes we can
7186025 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7186026 woe unto the single aging lonely white male with no future
7186027 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7186028 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7186029 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7186030 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7186031 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7186032 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7186033 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7186034 we found it unusual that none of these applications came through with protests
7186035 we have inquired with the authorities who said the protests and the queries of the citizens have been met in mutual agreement thats my reply
7186036 i take it with a big smile i was giving him what i think is fatherly advice and i stand by it
7186037 hes a 22 year old and its time to mature and show respect for his opponents
7186038 we heard allegations about the ages we took that very seriously we asked the international federation to open up an inquiry themselves eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the international federations not the ioc but of course we consider this as being a very serious issue
7186039 the boys ran a good race they ran a tough race bekele took charge he seems like he was having an easy day today
7186040 i never really expected a physical presence because hes rehabbing and also because hes such a competitor
7186041 i think its hard for him to come and watch as he said he couldnt even watch the pga championship on television so i think its hard for him to come to the field of battle without putting his uniform on i am not expecting a physical presence
7186042 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7186043 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7186044 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7186045 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7186046 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7186047 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7186048 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7186049 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7186050 it is a real buzz to get back there and actually drive the track
7186051 i had some fans with me to watch the first nationwide race this year and they got debris in their beer cans thats all they could talk about was how they were sitting so close that they got debris in their beer cans bristol is a great place its one of the best tracks we go to because of the atmosphere
7186052 people ask me all the time which racetrack is my favorite and before they can even get the question out i tell them its bristol
7186053 bristol is racing heaven a super fast short track with unbelievable banking and its only gotten better since they repaved it after the spring race in 2007
7186054 now you can race high and low and it opens up the track for more passing and better racing the two races at bristol are by far my favorite of the year daytona is daytona and indy is indy they are historic pressure packed and prestigious but bristol is just awesome bristol is fun fast paced challenging edge of your seat racing everything i love about racing
7186055 you just have to realize that more than likely youre going to make someone mad or youre going to get mad at someone else
7186056 you cant help it youre turning 500 laps around the place thats a lot of time to get into it with someone
7186057 races at bristol are always crazy but they seem to get a little wilder when were racing at night
7186058 i dont know why the night races seem to have more wrecks maybe its because the fans are so hyped up by the time the race starts the drivers just feed off of their excitement
7186059 the state has given its 37 527 employees a year to start getting fit or theyll pay 25 a month for insurance that otherwise is free alabama will be the first state to charge overweight state workers who dont work on slimming down while a handful of other states reward employees who adopt healthy behaviors

7186077 i tell people my father is left handed so i grew up facing left handed pitching
7186078 but you have to understand the anatomy of whats going on in the game hes averaging 13 7 pitches per inning which is the seventh lowest in baseball where guys get in trouble is with 20 25 and 30 pitch innings cc has none of those
7186079 i would much rather lose a game than take a chance of hurting anybody thats not the type of person i am
7186080 i respect him as a player i respect him as a person hes got a family i know how this business works he has to provide for his family i would never do anything that would take away from that ability i just couldnt live with myself
7186081 my family situation and time spent away from me is very important to be away from them and not to be playing every day to be a four hour flight away would be a real challenge from a mental aspect
7186082 when im on the mound i dont try to think too much i dont even know what my name is
7186083 mess with me and you mess with the whole trailer park
7186084 i wouldnt be surprised if they finished where they are now tampa bay is playing unbelievable baseball nobody expected tampa bay to be there but ive been saying since the start of the year they have the players
7186085 i have received handwritten notes on several occasions from saks
7186086 im a note writer so i appreciate the action and thought
7186087 its a way of engaging the customer and protecting the relationship they have
7186088 my answer to the question do the affluent have less money to spend
7186089 the affluent shopper feels like they have less money when they feel less affluent they are less likely to spend money on luxury nobody really needs any of the stuff in the luxury category
7186090 she might buy less but she is still coming in because she wants the quality of merchandise we offer
7186091 in the past bought three outfits and a major piece of jewelry every year might be buying two outfits and waiting for the jewelry until next year
7186092 there is a danger if a luxury brand dips too far into discounts
7186093 saks average customer is well above 100 000 annual income and neimans customer has an average income of around 250 000
7186094 they can buy goods on the first flow when they come into the store at full price
7186095 they can often buy goods at one third the prices they are seeing in paris london or milan
7186096 of all the luxury retailers saks stands alone at the top as a socially conscious retailer
7186097 saks has the reputation of being a reliable retailer among those who support charity events
7186098 this month the biltmore store expanded its womens shoe department and renamed it 10022 after the zip code of saks flagship store in new york it also recently doubled the size of its handbag section adding boutiques devoted to brands like chanel prada gucci fendi and louis vuitton
7186099 if they are this supportive of the community i think it is important to shop at saks
7186100 loyalty is especially important in the age of the internet
7186101 years ago there was more of a tendency to leave phoenix to shop
7186102 a lot of clients would jet out of scottsdale airport to shop in los angeles and san francisco quiet frankly we were losing shoppers to our own stores in other cities
7186103 they will call or write a special client and say bring three or four of your friends we show them the latest trends and they get undivided attention
7186104 if im being punished sometimes it hurts a lot the other times though it hurts but not too bad
7186105 no go on ill be gentle with you and we can see how you take it
7186106 to start with yes i go over his knee for the hand and the hairbrush and then when i get the strap it is over the back of that armchair
7186107 but dont worry dear you could probably only take my hand for now
7186108 okay im going to start with spanking you over your panties and we will take it from there if it gets too much for you then you say mercy okay you might want to say please stop etc but i will only stop when you say mercy because then i will know its too much for you
7186109 and you have such a nice little bubble butt as well jim would love to spank this butt a word of advice for you jamie if jim ever spanks you make sure you wear pretty panties because he is much more likely to leave them up longer if you do
7186110 i wouldnt be so sure jamie he has already mentioned to me on at least a half dozen occasions that you need a good spanking especially when you play your music too loud
7186111 i think in a minute we should pull these panties down dont you
7186112 if your panties are any indication young lady i think you are enjoying this a little bit too much
7186113 now that you are bare bottom over aunty sarahs lap i think it is time that we show you what a proper spanking feels like
7186114 jim is probably going to spank us both for this when he gets home tonight jamie be sure to put on some pretty panties
7186115 the studio is set to announce its plans for future dc movies in the next month for now though it is focused on releasing four comic book films in the next three years including a third batman film a new film reintroducing superman and two movies focusing on other dc comics characters

7186117 these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed

7186121 i am anxious to come back because it was a hard blow for me to miss the euro
7186122 i want to rejoin the team and to win more titles
7186123 ha ha ha i got you to read and practice all that archaic stuff and syntax suckahs
7186124 its like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged
7186125 there are people out there that have information that we still need
7186126 the two that have been arrested may have or not spoken with friends associates about what occurred on that night and wed like to hear from anyone that has information
7186127 we would prefer these persons contact us rather than we go to them
7186128 this doesnt bring john back but it does give the family answers to some questions theyve probably had
7186129 the family have been supportive of the investigation and very pleased with the result today
7186130 police inquiries are being made to determine the criminal liability of any other parties who may be involved
7186131 weve confirmed these two initially and those are what hes facing charges for right now we believe the suspect description matches the previous six as well

7186139 one farmer told me geese caused him about 50 000 in crop damage in a single year
7186140 north dakota opened aug 15 and thats the earliest goose season in history
7186141 during the summer when the geese cant fly they go on a picnic in the farmers fields

7186143 one of the problems you have is you see geese flying in to a pasture every morning and you say ill hunt there
7186144 but theres a fence row on the way to the pasture that another hunter sees the geese fly over every day and he hunts there
7186145 another guy has seen them fly over his house everyday at dawn so he hunts there the geese may be shot at three or four times before they ever get to that pasture
7186146 theyve just moved in there over the past 20 years and things have gotten progressively worse
7186147 must we really light a candle to see the sun the electron is materially inconceivable and yet it is so perfectly known through its effects that we use it to illuminate our cities guide our airliners through the night skies and take the most accurate measurements what strange rationale makes some physicists accept the inconceivable electron as real while refusing to accept the reality of a designer on the ground that they cannot conceive of him the inconceivability of some ultimate issue which always will lie outside scientific resolution should not be allowed to rule out any theory that explains the interrelationship of observed data and is useful for prediction
7186148 one of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical decisive hour write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year

7186156 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7186157 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7186158 its a commonsense response to the realities on the ground
7186159 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles

7186188 you the lamb are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were slain and with your blood you purchased men for god from every tribe and language and people and nation you have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our god and they will reign on the earth
7186189 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7186190 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7186191 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7186192 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7186193 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7186194 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7186195 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7186196 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7186197 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7186198 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7186199 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7186200 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7186201 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7186202 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7186203 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7186204 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7186205 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7186206 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7186207 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7186208 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7186209 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7186210 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7186211 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7186212 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7186213 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7186214 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7186215 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7186216 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7186217 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7186218 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7186219 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants

7186226 every single biden is out there just making the case
7186227 i would hope that joe would never be a politician like hillary clinton
7186228 i feel the travers is certainly the second most prestigious 3 year old race
7186229 its a race to win a race for the ages
7186230 my head was down and i was riding hard i just happened to have the right nod at the right time
7186231 with the kind of trip he had and to do what he did it takes a special horse it shows hes right up there with the best of them
7186232 i thought he went well he had to go around horses and he got beat by one of the kentucky derby favorites
7186233 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7186234 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7186235 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7186236 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7186237 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7186238 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7186239 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7186240 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7186241 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7186242 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7186243 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7186244 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7186245 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7186246 try to use that word or those words more often
7186247 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7186248 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7186249 nee mijn fiets stond echt niet hinderlijk kijk maar er was loopruimte genoeg
7186250 i stepped in a hole in the outfield in fresno and tweaked my knee
7186251 thats why i didnt play the first three games here
7186252 i was so comfortable in atlanta for so many years i got spoiled
7186253 everything about this year was frustrating i started slow and didnt hit well then the injury and the disabled list and now my second time on the dl
7186254 i think im getting where i want to be im seeing results the last four games here im feeling it and getting results
7186255 ill be here seven eight more games its tough to work on stuff while youre up there because youre trying to win games
7186256 matt is learning to play center now and doing a good job all of them are swinging the bat well
7186257 hopefully ill be back with the dodgers next year im far away from being done
7186258 it was only a matter of time before their bats come alive
7186259 you dont want to see holliday come up with the bases loaded late in a game
7186260 im glad i got the chance to help the team again
7186261 you dont get that many chances and to have another chance with the bases loaded i was excited about another opportunity i was thankful for another shot at it
7186262 if you believe in a higher power you should definitely thank him because it could have been a lot worse
7186263 there was no prewarning in fact they got a call afterward saying that you might get some severe weather but nothing beforehand
7186264 every mistake that is made we call all the election judges that are at that precinct and tell them what was wrong and in many cases theyre not going to work again
7186265 we use every one of these cases as a training tool for the fall
7186266 if theres an administrative glitch either on the part of the election office or the voter their votes going to count
7186267 i told jay if we improve that in our game deep ball and press coverage were going to be pretty tough
7186268 he makes big play after big play we cant do anything about it we have to do what we can do
7186269 were going to treat it just like if somebody sprained his ankle a week before we played
7186270 brandons going to win a lot of games for us this season
7186271 thanks for the jumpin moonlight serenade hope you dont mind the 8am piano scales
7186272 we know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers anyone who does not love remains in death

7186375 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security

7186381 already the debate has moved on no longer are we discussing the ethics of whether to perform a face transplant but merely the ethics of how
7186382 champ its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up its how quickly you get up
7186383 it was here in springfield where i saw all that is america converge
7186384 it was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable that it is possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised and that so long as we are willing to listen to each other we can assume the best in people instead of the worst
7186385 i would guess theyre going to try to keep illinois out of the spotlight and if illinois is in the spotlight it will be a challenge for them to show the unity and hope that the national campaign is trying to emphasize
7186386 i think its something like four oclock in the morning in the mens room of the convention center speaking to a handful of voters im hopeful i can persuade them and we can carry colorado
7186387 they kill jobs they kill education funding they try to take away health care from people
7186388 voters know that in illinois and in washington barack obama stood up to members of both parties to pass sweeping ethics reforms that reduced the influence of money and special interests over the legislative process
7186389 the campaign is aware of whats going on in illinois
7186390 i think its fair game and i think the republicans nationally should pounce on it
7186391 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7186392 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7186393 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7186394 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7186395 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7186396 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7186397 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7186398 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7186399 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7186400 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7186401 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7186402 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7186403 mmmmm it looks like grass lets go try it this is a fabulous buffet such extraordinary variety
7186404 wow what a big hill i wonder whats up there

7186406 i think i see some gourmet grass over that next knoll lets go try it

7186410 i think thats the same story for almost everyone who comes here for the first time
7186411 the most surprisingly high prices are those for housing and food products fruit is amazingly expensive even compared to scandinavian countries
7186412 high housing costs can definitely be a deterrent for foreigners who want to come to work here with housing allowances given by their companies they would get housing of a much better quality in many other countries than they get here
7186413 montes alpha a popular chilean wine is sold here for 38 000 won per bottle
7186414 but its retail price is only 16 257 won in japan meaning koreas distribution system is underdeveloped and saddled with too many middlemen
7186415 starbucks coffee is more expensive here than most other asian countries thats mainly because of high rents
7186416 high production costs perennially short supplies from domestic suppliers tariffs and non tariff barriers combine to push up prices
7186417 opening up the market and higher competition would naturally lower consumer prices but this will come slowly
7186418 state governments have offered land but id like to assert the project will be a reality
7186419 theres a sense of tension violence its not a conducive atmosphere

7186438 the glide slope gives you an angle to fly at and the indications in the cockpit will tell you if youre below or above that point in space
7186439 youve got to watch your instruments and believe in them

7186443 we ensure the safety of the national air space if something happens it wont be because the system was bad
7186444 weve had trouble making ends meet here because of key expenses like insurance and real estate taxes our cook county real estate taxes have been going up 50 to 100 percent per year and that played a big part in our decision to sell
7186445 sales have not gone up 50 to 100 percent per year so something had to give we are sad to be leaving but when you are in business you have to make business decisions
7186446 this has been part of gms grand scheme for a long time but for us it happened very quickly within a few months
7186447 my family owns this real estate and i would have to vacate it either way so i just decided to let jeff sullivan buy me out
7186448 obviously since this dealership had its roots in the old busse buick this is a lost piece of history for mount prospect
7186449 because the village has such a diverse revenue stream this wont be a crushing blow but when the economy is slow any loss hurts
7186450 opel had an ad which featured an opel cadet in a tug of war with a live elephant to show how powerful the car was
7186451 so they rented and then purchased the elephant as a promotion and it became a fixture here

7186456 theyre not as popular today as golden retrievers or yellow labs
7186457 i train them and i hunt with them in wisconsin

7186459 ok ik sta hier in de lange munt in die winkel waar we die prachtige nerts zagen je weet wel welke ik bedoel h ik vraag me af of ik die mantel mag kopen van jou

7186462 ja ok maar voor die prijs hoop ik toch dat die auto full option is
7186463 dit is misschien een beetje teveel gevraagd maar ik was ook even langs de bank om ons saldo na te kijken ummmmhhh ik zag vanmorgen dat die prachtige villa met dat grote zwembad en die 2 tennispleinen te koop is je weet wel welke ik bedoel niet
7186464 never before have i experienced such lazy attendants and useless phone support
7186465 i cam in the other day to pre book my reservations and was shocked to find out that they had lost my frequent customer card and forgotten that i called last week to arrange my reservation
7186466 were excited to announce ground breaking on our citys newest project a online casinos school for talented students to foster careers and livelihoods
7186467 once construction begins we estimate a two year completion time
7186468 we desparately needed facilities for all our programs and the high school was running out of space now with this online casinos school getting built and fields set to be operational next spring we will have plenty of space for people to recreate and enjoy team sports
7186469 which will be open to all students with a b or better overall average well be competing against all other district schools both public and private to expose our scholar athletes to the best competition in the area
7186470 this initiative will save paper save time and make use of the information super highway
7186471 and since we wont have to update texts every couple of years the information we use from the net will always be up to date and relevent to each field offered at our online casinos school
7186472 this project is vast but will be very beneficial to our youth
7186473 this aspect of our curriculum will really prepare students for the real world
7186474 and we believe it will help them gain meaningful employment after graduation
7186475 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best online casinos learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
7186476 it was here in springfield where i saw all that is america converge
7186477 it was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable that it is possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised and that so long as we are willing to listen to each other we can assume the best in people instead of the worst
7186478 i would guess theyre going to try to keep illinois out of the spotlight and if illinois is in the spotlight it will be a challenge for them to show the unity and hope that the national campaign is trying to emphasize
7186479 i think its something like four oclock in the morning in the mens room of the convention center speaking to a handful of voters im hopeful i can persuade them and we can carry colorado
7186480 they kill jobs they kill education funding they try to take away health care from people
7186481 voters know that in illinois and in washington barack obama stood up to members of both parties to pass sweeping ethics reforms that reduced the influence of money and special interests over the legislative process
7186482 the campaign is aware of whats going on in illinois
7186483 i think its fair game and i think the republicans nationally should pounce on it
7186484 this place is a godsend it really is everyone is so nice and i can hear
7186485 i thought gosh how many trips are we going to make here because i have two other kids at home this is really so convenient a lot of times you come in and feel like a number you know in emergencies but i felt very important i had a great experience
7186486 todays opening marks the beginning of a new era in improved access to high quality health care in the region
7186487 this new huntley campus provides superior care to individuals and families living here in the fastest growing region of greater mchenry county centegras commitment to community health and wellness is reflected in this beautifully detailed campus that covers a majority of the health care continuum it is based in the goal to keep residents well beyond expectation with convenient access to medical and wellness services
7186488 the addition of centegra immediate care in the huntley algonquin and lake in the hills communities will provide special services that help residents stay healthy and receive timely high quality and compassionate care
7186489 your letter begs forgiveness for something that happened over sixty years ago
7186490 i must say i know there are at least two sides in a divorce ive been there
7186491 if it had not been for her it would have been really hard to find him
7186492 he was ready to greet his daughter and i was like this is a perfect stranger
7186493 we both love each other and thats very obvious when you see us together
7186494 i finally have a daughter i can see and hold and love
7186495 it will be a whole new experience for me it should be quite exciting
7186496 if you call someone up and they hang up on you youre not prone to redial
7186497 we made a connection that just brought the last 60 years up front
7186498 i started from nothing and had a whole family all in one little letter
7186499 i like when its up on top with curls hanging
7186500 theyve got to know how to do it the right way
7186501 its more like stylish but comfortable its like be comfortable but look nice
7186502 you dont want to do too much because you have to go to school
7186503 we really see your hair and makeup as being your no 1 accessory perfect is a great word but we dont have to strive for perfection were all beautiful in our own way
7186504 its time for the curly headed girls to embrace their curls
7186505 saya mahu melihat sejauh mana usaha karyawan dalam hal ini saya tidak menyalahkan penyanyi indonesia tetapi saya menyalahkan syarikat korporat dan stesen radio masalah ini boleh dibendung dari peringkat awal kerana kuasa terletak di tangan mereka
7186506 kenapa mereka perlu dengar suara warga indonesia yang hanya sekitar tiga juta orang tetapi tidak mendengar suara orang kita kesalahan bagi saya terletak pada mereka kerana terlalu membesarkan sangat artis seberang
7186507 macam mana artis tempatan yang sedang membina nama dan keyakinan diri kalau karya indonesia saja yang dipandang terlalu banyak sangat double standard yang berlaku dalam industri muzik kita lagu mereka kita sanjung sedangkan orang kita mengutuk lagu artis tempatan
7186508 jika mereka bagus sangat buat lagu bagi pada kami dan kami akan nyanyikan ini termasuklah anugerah tempatan yang juga memberi peluang kepada artis seberang beraksi dan beri mereka anugerah adakah industri muzik indonesia melakukan perkara yang serupa kepada artis kita rasanya mereka tidak memutarkan lagu kita kalau adapun setakat dua hingga tiga peratus saja
7186509 kita perlu cari masalah ini dari akar umbi jangan salahkan mereka tetapi masalah ini berpunca dari orang kita sendiri apabila sebut saja karya dari indonesia mereka akan anggap lagu itu baik
7186510 saya tidak anggap kehadiran mereka sebagai ancaman sebaliknya saya jadikan mereka sebagai motivasi untuk menghasilkan lagu yang lebih baik cuma saya kecewa apabila orang menuduh hujan meniru penyanyi indonesia
7186511 perjuangan yang dilakukan karyawan ini cukup membuka mata saya sebagai orang baru banyak benda yang saya tidak pernah terfikir sebelum ini diutarakan sehingga saya merasakan diri saya cukup kerdil saya amat kagum dengan usaha mereka ini
7186512 petisyen ini tidak dapat dilaksanakan dengan mudah kerana perkara seperti ini memerlukan perbincangan dengan banyak pihak
7186513 bercakap dari sudut suria fm pula kami tidak memainkan lagu indonesia saja sebaliknya kami adalah stesen radio pertama yang menyokong artis baru seperti kumpulan underground contohnya hujan dan meet uncle hussein
7186514 macam mana kami nak mainkan lagu artis tempatan kalau kualiti tidak ada kami perlukan album baru yang ada kualiti kalau artis malaysia tidak ada produk bagaimana kami nak putarkan lagu mereka dengan lebih kerap
7186515 crm juga sebelum ini pernah menyuarakan pendapat kepada syarikat rakaman mengenai hal artis kita sudah tidak ada material yang baik
7186516 chelsea have agreed terms for andriy shevchenko to return to ac milan
7186517 the saints are a good team and they were playing as if it was a real game
7186518 he said he did not want to give a statement
7186519 then all of a sudden the next day police say he made a statement
7186520 i have people here that recognize me by my dog
7186521 she did a nice job and her prices are reasonable
7186522 its a delightful event and its good to see participation in glen ellyn
7186523 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7186524 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7186525 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7186526 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7186527 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7186528 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7186529 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7186530 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7186531 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7186532 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7186533 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7186534 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7186535 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7186536 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7186537 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7186538 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7186539 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7186540 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7186541 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7186542 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7186543 he would have needed a lot of skill to get to the ball and he has it
7186544 but i thought the ball would get through the infield
7186545 you have to stay calm on the outside for the kids you dont want to panic
7186546 i told him if hes going to compete hes going to have days like this
7186547 its not the last time its going to happen to him in his life its a good learning experience
7186548 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7186549 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7186550 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7186551 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7186552 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues

7186560 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7186561 are we going to put up the guardrail before somebody goes over the cliff or wait until someone goes over the cliff
7186562 motorists are supposed to obey the law by stopping when they see a pedestrian in a crosswalk but they dont always remember to do that
7186563 we are extremely pleased with the enhancers operation here in st petersburg and our citizens have been quick to adopt them
7186564 over the years ive seen people make mad dashes across midlothian road
7186565 but since the units went in theres been a huge improvement in the reaction of the motorists in yielding i think youre going to find that this is going to be a new wave of pedestrian assistance
7186566 we feel it is the best product on the table right now for crosswalk safety short of a traffic signal
7186567 we strongly encourage its consideration for other communities with pedestrian crosswalk issues
7186568 its not about willpower we treat our clients with therapy
7186569 what i learned the past 10 years is very sad its unbelievable the destruction this causes
7186570 we found that unless youve experienced it you dont really know the experience of losing a child from drugs
7186571 even compared to suicide leukemia or a car accident drugs have a terrible stigma
7186572 i know mary and germaine are just a phone call away
7186573 the street doesnt belong to individuals it belongs to the community
7186574 we are giving each of you a copy of the reports so that you can see for yourselves we need help
7186575 what about our quality of life living on this highway
7186576 were expending funds and were expending resources we really want to make things go away and the answer is not just a stop sign
7186577 were trying to be good naperville citizens and say heres a good thing we think it makes sense
7186578 its a thing for the region very much for naperville its in the first class thinking tradition of naperville i think it adds to the cultural life
7186579 asked the resulting amount be kicked back into construction of the theater
7186580 we need people who feel strongly this could be a wonderful project and the next riverwalk for naperville and the capstone to what is already a great city but its a one time opportunity
7186581 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7186582 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun

7186589 i think joe bidens nephew is a douche ergo i am irritated by biden as vp
7186590 the root cause of instability is the india pakistan conflict
7186591 for the first time in 60 years the u s has leverage in both india and pakistan
7186592 use its influence in those two countries to minimize tensions
7186593 thats because the u s has tended to look at its short term interests and successive pakistan governments have not made the people aware of the magnitude of this menace which is tearing the society apart
7186594 if pakistan fails it is a tragedy not just for pakistan but for the whole world
7186595 we vigorously protest against this inhuman treatment of mr randall echanis as we continue to protest against the trumped up charges filed against him and against his illegal detention in violation of the jasig and the carhrihl
7186596 incredibly overcrowded with more than 4 500 detainees while its capacity is for 1 000 prisoners
7186597 the detention center is very hot dirty water is scarce and the food is terrible there is no electricity from monday to friday in the morning
7186598 this kind of degrading treatment is many times worse than the treatment suffered by political prisoners under the marcos dictatorship
7186599 the speed and stealth with which an outlaw state or terrorists could use weapons of mass destruction and the catastrophic damage they could inflict require us to consider new ways of acting not reacting

7186623 the key for us was to continue to give ourselves a chance with runners in scoring position
7186624 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7186625 radeon 0 direct rendering not officially supported on rn50 rc410 r600
7186626 its amazing this is what i get paid to do this is what i live for
7186627 this is all i really want to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7186628 last year battling through this surgery and having this team behind me with their support its meant everything
7186629 ninety pitches in five innings isnt going to cut it every time out i realize that but its a big win for the team right now
7186630 hes in our rotation and thats the bottom line i think it means a lot to him especially what hes been through to be able to come out and contribute at such an important time of year
7186631 obviously he wasnt lighting up the radar gun but you dont have to do that in this game if you hit your spots
7186632 i think he wanted to get out there and prove himself to new york
7186633 thats the most important thing if youre out to prove something to everyone else i think it takes away a special part of being in the major leagues
7186634 obviously theres been a lot going on the last four years i cant ignore that but im still the same person i was four years ago when i go out there on the mound
7186635 the hitter walked toward the dugout to throw his bat and helmet away he in doing so has abandoned his effort to reach the next base
7186636 im glad i got the chance to help the team again
7186637 you dont get that many chances and to have another chance with the bases loaded i was excited about another opportunity i was thankful for another shot at it
7186638 when youre hitting third on any team youre hitting third for a reason
7186639 hes more often than not put good swings on balls driven in big runs its not always the long ball
7186640 it was only a matter of time before their bats come alive
7186641 you dont want to see holliday come up with the bases loaded late in a game
7186642 i threw 40 pitches in the second inning and didnt make the adjustments
7186643 hes in the best place hes been all season that was a big inning for us to stop it right there
7186644 you never like to give up hits and runs but there was a plus side
7186645 a lot of my misses were down in my last three or four starts all of my misses were up and they were hitting the ball harder
7186646 he was on the corners all night the ball was down he mixed his pitches
7186647 we knew coming into the game we saw that they lost
7186648 he hides the arm a little bit his changeup looks just like his fastball it can be up in the zone which can look like a fastball and get early swings on it
7186649 i think after the first time around we just kind of dialed in on him
7186650 i was feeling good enough to throw another inning and tc comes in with the bases loaded gets an rbi
7186651 i cant control that i went six innings anything to help the team win
7186652 the radar gun only says 86 or 88 but hes a lot more sneaky than that
7186653 he kind of turns his body a little bit hes got a little bit of a pause then all of a sudden out comes the ball
7186654 im just looking for a good pitch and trying to use the whole field
7186655 they got a couple of runs that inning and we could have been out of there and still seen a 2 1 ballgame
7186656 but then it just kind of got out of hand
7186657 for me afterlife is about how close or far i am to god
7186658 you give my my drive you move your hand so i can take it myself or i hit you over the head with this and then take it
7186659 gosh weve been working on this together for four weeks already we should be best friends by now
7186660 nope ive never become best friends in less than six weeks
7186661 send in your application ill have my secretary look at it
7186662 ive only got room in my circles for one male best friend and hes got to give me a diamond ring
7186663 a valued colleague a useful colleague and a colleague whose company is pleasant but a colleague nonetheless ive never treated you any differently have i
7186664 but youll still be around after the summer right i mean youre a good person to know
7186665 and youre a useful person to know so yes of course ill keep you around

7186682 we were successful in fielding squads last year and generated a lot of enthusiasm for the 2008 season
7186683 this year we have a roster of over 100 kids including cheerleaders from bloomfield canandaigua and victor participating in the program
7186684 ive done my best to bring a good winning attitude to the program it has been a 180 degree turnaround from last season
7186685 it is my vision to get football into the high school level in bloomfield
7186686 our numbers are awesome this year thanks to the work of our administrators
7186687 we have 84 total football players which is good for a soccer driven school
7186688 we put flyers up around all of the schools and had the gym teachers lend a hand in recruiting kids
7186689 our main source of recruiting was the pancake breakfast we held on super bowl sunday
7186690 they have worked so hard in turning the program around
7186691 now i feel it is the coaches job to keep the program running if we make it fun for the kids i hope we will continue to keep the numbers

7186719 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7186720 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7186721 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7186724 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
7186725 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
7186726 we were trying to show to the world and our military and civilian establishment that the politicians have learnt their lessons and they would now practice the politics of principles never indulge in petty power politics and lead by example sacrificing their personal and party interests for larger national causes
7186727 but mr zardari could not pull himself out of the groove of grabbing key positions rewarding his cronies and friends and never overcoming the fear factor
7186728 but the ppp leader is stuck with the nro and fears that if it is reopened he would again have to face the dark shadows of his past
7186729 he thinks by grabbing power and dominating every decision making institution he was pre empting the inevitable he is sadly mistaken because the pml n has taken up all the national issues based on principled stands and had thus received massive support but mr zardaris political moves have been looked down and condemned by every section of the society including even the serious and saner elements of the ppp itself
7186730 then we will stand upright and be vindicated by the masses
7186731 we were trying to keep him on the ground so that the political class as a whole does not get the blame but there is a limit to what can be done his case is now getting beyond repair

7186734 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7186735 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7186736 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7186737 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7186738 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7186739 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

7186752 esfuerzo muy grande de todos pero d a con d a hay que seguir revalid ndolo
7186753 el grupo ha hecho un buen trabajo se pudo concretar en el segundo tiempo ya que el partido estaba muy trabado
7186754 sabemos que es un partido internacional muy complicado lo bueno es que se sac el triunfo hoy para alzar la motivaci n y esperemos que el martes saquemos un buen resultado para ir de visita m s tranquilos
7186755 en un principio del juego se nos complicaron las cosas por que a pesar de que el equipo quiso proponer desde los primeros minutos el rival supo aprovechar dos errores que tuvimos para sorprendernos y tener la ventaja de dos goles sin embargo no se dej de luchar hasta el final por rescatar un mejor resultado y la muestra est en que alcanzamos a remontar el marcador que tiene un gran m rito obtener este triunfo
7186756 en el primero tiempo tuvimos muy poca posesi n de pelota lo que provoc darle espacios al rival esto quiere decir que debemos afinar ese tipo de detalles para estar m s atentos en los siguientes partidos pues no podemos estar remando contra corriente en cada jornada para tener una gran reacci n y rescatar buenos resultados
7186757 ha sido dif cil pero estoy contento por la continuidad
7186758 fue dif cil muy trabado tambi n tuve la suerte de convertir y el gol da los tres puntos lo importante es seguir arriba sab amos que ste era muy dif cil es un rival del grupo no hab a perdido tampoco y ahora trataremos de descansar para encara el compromiso de este martes
7186759 estando ah arriba y encarando el primer partido en casa con nuestra gente va a ser un partido en donde trataremos de sacar la victoria como local para ir m s tranquilos para el juego de vuelta
7186760 ha sido dif cil pero estoy contento por la continuidad y la confianza que se me ha brindado y sta es la manera de corresponder anotando para el equipo
7186761 nosotros no nos equivocamos y por eso nos llevamos la victoria
7186762 hoy nos enfrentamos a un equipo muy complicado que no te regala nada el partido iba a ser as cerrad simo estaba para el que se equivocara menos nosotros no nos equivocamos y por eso nos llevamos la victoria pero ahora viene lo complicado en donde tendremos que alternar en dos competencias pero hasta este momento est bien
7186763 vamos a ver c mo se recupera el plantel hoy fue muy desgastante el partido vamos a ver si no tenemos alg n jugador con molestias que nos haga cambiar el plantel
7186764 s se equivoc fue para los dos lados pero creo que hoy no es tan bueno que hablemos del arbitraje m s bien del funcionamiento del equipo y de c mo ganamos
7186765 falta un poco necesitamos integrar a gente que es importante como tressor reina y guerrero no va a ser f cil para ellos pues hoy los que est n de titulares llevan cierta ventaja
7186766 hoy es una clara muestra que con la continuidad y trabajo se pueden conseguir muchas cosas que al final esa es la clave del equipo en las ciudades somos muy novedosos queremos nombres raros nombres ex ticos pero la realidad es el trabajo lo que te lleva a conseguir lo que quieres
7186767 el desempe o me gust lo malo es que perdimos
7186768 la expulsi n fue razonable y desde luego no es un joven mal intencionado simplemente lleg tarde a la jugada el rbitro lo juzga bien y obviamente jugar con un hombre menos influye
7186769 fue un partido muy re ido todav a con diez hombre dimos pelea y cuando se emparejaron las cosas se vio que pudimos remontar en el marcador pero as es el futbol y bueno nos ganaron y nos ganaron bien
7186770 el desempe o me gust lo malo es que perdimos el resultado no me gust pero las circunstancias del partido como apreciar nosotros hab amos sido el equipo m s disciplinado del torneo tenemos que seguir por el mismo camino retomar lo que hemos venido haciendo y no decaer
7186771 algunas llegada tuvimos sobre todo cuando entr lucas lobos parec a que el equipo pod a hacer jugadas de gol pero con una defensa muy s lida y un equipo bien parado como es el san luis iba a ser complicado
7186772 fue merecido el rbitro estuvo en su papel lo que vio lo marc y punto quiz un poquito rigorista la expulsi n de rivas y eso fue lo que yo apreci de lejos el nazareno estaba m s cerca
7186773 no es un equipo para caerse tengo temor que nos vallamos libremente al ataque no no no hay que guardar la calma la tranquilidad simplemente hay que ver para arriba y se acab un tropiezo lo tiene cualquiera
7186774 es uno de los mejores t cnicos que hay sin duda ha hecho un gran equipo de ste y ah est la prueba
7186775 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
7186776 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
7186777 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
7186778 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
7186779 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
7186780 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
7186781 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
7186782 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7186783 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7186784 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7186785 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7186786 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7186787 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7186788 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7186789 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7186790 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7186791 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7186792 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7186793 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7186794 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7186795 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7186796 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7186797 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7186798 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7186799 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7186800 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7186801 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7186802 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7186803 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7186804 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7186805 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7186806 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7186807 me voy bien por el sentido de que hay maneras de perder es decir que como lo que nos paso anteriormente contra tecos que no supimos manejar el partido cuando llevamos una ventaja de dos goles esto quiere decir que nos falt un poquito de experiencia por que creo que se jug bastante bien s lo hay que aprender a manejar la mentalidad e inteligencia
7186808 hay que tomar en cuenta que la cantidad de j venes que alinearon nos afect un poco pero creo que los l deres tambi n les falt aportar un poco m s para que no se resienta una gran diferencia de un momento a otro en el marcador pero independientemente de todo esto creo que analizaremos qu fue lo que paso en el segundo gol de cruz azul pues no pueden seguir pasando esos errores en la l nea defensiva
7186809 lo dije all y los sigo diciendo considero que el martes hicieron un trabajo liviano porque conozco los trabajos de la selecci n el mi rcoles fue el juego y no entrenaron luego el jueves ellos toman el avi n a las nueve de la ma ana como se ten a previsto para que despu s de las diez de la ma ana ten an que estar en el aeropuerto de monterrey para dirigirse de inmediato al entrenamiento el cual empez hasta a las once esperando la llegada de ellos y por los menos que treinta o cuarenta minutos trabajaran lo cual no fue as
7186810 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7186811 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7186812 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7186813 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7186814 try to use that word or those words more often
7186815 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7186816 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7186817 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7186818 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7186819 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7186820 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7186821 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7186822 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7186823 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7186824 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7186825 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7186826 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7186827 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7186828 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7186829 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7186830 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7186831 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7186832 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7186833 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7186834 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7186835 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7186836 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7186837 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7186838 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7186839 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7186840 this year the road to the white house runs through the west
7186841 there are growing numbers of voters who are scratching their heads and saying where did my party go and ive heard more republicans than democrats saying that
7186842 the republican party has a great challenge in knitting together those people who are republicans because they dont want people interfering in their private lives and the people who are republicans because they want to interfere in other peoples private lives
7186843 theres so much in our regional economy of construction development tourism hospitality agriculture in which immigration labor is vital
7186844 and a lot of people realize that closing the border is going to lead to significant changes in things like food prices and food availability
7186845 weve seen the democrats put a lot of interest in trying to win nevada colorado and new mexico theyve sunk a lot of resources into nevada which has been great for mobilization of voter turnout
7186846 foreclosure gas prices health insurance inflation unemployment creeping towards seven percent its a perfect storm of economic issues
7186847 all that is likely to trump iraq and questions of national security
7186848 we discovered it this morning it is the 452nd we have found in the last three years
7186849 we need their experience after all they are experts they have to combat tunnels dug by mexicans to cross into the united states
7186850 we are already finding more tunnels ourselves more than 200 this year but we want to use their more successful methods of tunnel detection and destruction
7186851 it is the semi permanent closure of the rafah crossing after the arrival of hamas in gaza which has led to the increase in smuggling tunnels
7186852 before hamas seized power the crossing was opened at least twice a week allowing normal and legal passage of palestinians of aid and provisions
7186853 the longer the israeli blockade lasts the more you will find weapons ammunition and drugs before the contraband was more harmless like food fuel or cigarettes
7186854 the police regularly find arms caches in the sinai desert west of the crossing the weapons never make it as far as the border
7186855 they wanted a provocation at sea but they wont get it
7186856 we didnt have anybody famous it was old fashioned people power we just wanted to show what happens when ordinary people from around the world get together to try breaking this immoral siege on gaza
7186857 we never intended for this to be a humanitarian mission its about human rights in gaza

7186936 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7186937 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7186938 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7186939 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7186940 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7186941 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7186942 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7186943 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7186944 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7186945 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7186946 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7186947 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7186948 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7186949 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7186950 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7186951 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7186952 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7186953 i dont really know much about what becomes of my character ive never been a fan of comics the format irritates me its like is that his thought balloon but i do know gordons daughter barbara becomes batgirl but well never see that not in the hands of chris nolan

7186961 there is no way of knowing how many of these were actually requests for ballots in the 2006 election
7186962 the quality of information regarding overseas absentee ballots is low
7186963 i didn t even understand how to do anything with being an overseas voter
7186964 i kept running into walls where i couldn t get any information eventually i just gave up and said i d try again next time
7186965 if they re lucky they ll be contacted in time to get that information and get it back
7186966 the likelihood is that it won t get done in time
7186967 it was supposed to be back to my county on june 3 because that s when all the voting was
7186968 i didn t even get my ballot until the last week of may
7186969 i don t even know if my vote made it i hope it did
7186970 fvap has been put in the worst situation of any military commander
7186971 they ve been given all the responsibility and none of the authority
7186972 fvap is limited in its ability to affect state and voting procedures because it lacks the authority to require states to take action on absentee voting initiatives
7186973 they get no carrot to entice states and no stick to compel them
7186974 i didn t really pay attention in the past and felt there was no real reason
7186975 i m more into my military career now and figured i d vote for what i feel is right
7186976 i squawked to gov arnold schwarzenegger president bush my local party after about three years of squawking i gave up

7186990 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
7186991 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death

7187011 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
7187012 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
7187013 and we realize that as a result we provide new online casino business hirees with substantial benefits to stay onboard and grow their career with us
7187014 last month after the closure of neoma bristol inc we hired nearly half of all their admin staff in one week
7187015 and this has really helped our business in many ways and given these people another chance at having meaningful employment in this online casino industry
7187016 we also want highly motivated individuals with a background in online casino marketing on the internet
7187017 mostly because our internet sales division is booming and we need to explore all marketing opportunities within this important medium
7187018 with the recent boom in the online casino market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
7187019 our hr department is by far the largest unit at iruegas kundtz inc
7187020 and rightly so with stock par values increasing by the month we need more and more hirees to satisfy our growing corportate needs
7187021 this new program has really helped our online casino company
7187022 and it also allows us to see what other firms are offering to new job applicants this helps get an edge on the competition and strengthens our human capital greatly
7187023 i cant explain why i didnt think i had any problems with the heat or humidity
7187024 i felt fine it was just that my legs were smashed and there wasnt anything i could do about it the guys you have passed in the first 19ks are coming past you
7187025 its just shattering ive been to three olympic games and i just feel like ive failed three times its as simple as that
7187026 all of the hard work ive put in over the last two and a half years especially my preparation in the last five months i didnt deserve that result
7187027 sometimes you dont get what you deserve and im going to have to live with that now
7187028 i dont make the sacrifices i dont make the commitment emotionally physically and financially to put in a result like that
7187029 its not fair on my wife shes been unbelievable with her workload i cant justify another four years of doing this and im just very lucky that i can probably retire on my own terms

7187074 after a while you hope things start falling your way and they did
7187075 thank god for that because we were trying to give it away there at the beginning
7187076 a couple of things didnt go our way but hey its fine
7187077 were still going to come out here and do our thing thats what we did
7187078 it was kind of scary but we came back and did a good job on offense and got in the end zone we just wanted it more than they did i could see it
7187079 the ball was in slow motion because im the linebacker that cant catch in our group
7187080 it felt pretty good to get it and get in the end zone i dont really remember it i just put my hands up and it stayed in there

7187087 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7187088 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7187089 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7187090 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7187091 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7187092 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7187093 might incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

7187095 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7187096 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7187097 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7187098 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7187099 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7187100 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7187101 its cute but can you really breathe out of that thing
7187102 the best things in life come from your own happiness
7187103 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7187104 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7187105 the best things in life come from your own happiness
7187106 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7187107 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7187108 the coalition forces have made mistakes so many times and killed so many civilians we are asking president karzai to come here
7187109 hey those gazelle troopers look just like those goons from ffx 2
7187110 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
7187111 and by the word of my power have i created them which is mine only begotten son who is full of grace and truth
7187112 your beliefs become your thoughts your thoughts become your words your words become your actions your actions become your habits your habits become your values your values become your destiny

7187115 lady do you have any idea how many kids we have in here every day buying games do you think we have the time to look at each and every purchase
7187116 any failure rate is problematic but the failure rate were seeing is downright pathetic
7187117 similar to age restrictions on alcohol tobacco pornography and other products that are potentially harmful to children parents deserve a reasonable expectation that age restrictions for adult entertainment products will be enforced at the retail level
7187118 it is outrageous that retailers are not exercising greater responsibility and even more absurd that there are no meaningful consequences for those retailers who ignore their industrys own age restriction policies
7187119 countless independent studies confirm that repeated exposure to graphic sexual violent and profanity laced video games has a harmful and long term effect on children
7187120 it is high time for retailers to follow the video game industry guidelines and check ids so that children will not be able to purchase m rated video games
7187121 perhaps the retailers felt the pressure was off after the ftcs report was published but frankly either rate of failure is wholly unacceptable
7187122 we encourage concerned citizens to contact their congressional representatives to ensure that the video game industry will become more responsible
7187123 americas children need to be protected from harmful exposure to these products and parents should be able to rely on the industrys promises
7187124 it has been our pleasure to serve the reynoldsburg community for the past five years
7187125 the new location better positions us for greater opportunities for ministry
7187126 our goal is to be a one source location with christian resources for churches and individuals as we strive to fulfill our vision of providing biblical solutions for life
7187127 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
7187128 but god proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
7187129 for by grace you are saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is gods gift not from works so that no one can boast
7187130 if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
7187131 the purpose of the blog is to have real conversations with the curriculums end users the teachers
7187132 my posts arent earth shattering they are based on the lesson in the study materials for that week im not re teaching the lesson but sharing personal stories of what god has been teaching me that relates to that weeks lesson
7187133 coming from the outside lifeway world i know what it is like to have no personal connection with lifeway
7187134 on the blog i hope i come across as being authentic while building credibility by putting myself out there
7187135 we used a few short term bible studies first from threads then migrated to lifematters
7187136 i visit the threads website often just for information and articles about teaching young adults and i just accidentally found this particular blog now that ive found it i rely on it each week
7187137 it makes me feel better to have another piece of material to pull from another example or illustration to talk about
7187138 sometimes i read the whole blog word for word to the class other times i just paraphrase or work it into my normal teaching
7187139 i e mail my class about twice a week with tidbits of information about the lesson or just life and i frequently use the blog material or parts of it in my e mail i like that its real life stuff that these young people can relate to even me at 40 something years old
7187140 this is the third quarter we are using the material and our study sessions have become ripe with meaningful discussions and connecting gods word to our young adults everyday lives
7187141 i check it out weekly to see what insights have been added regarding that weeks bible study
7187142 it gives some unique insight as i prepare for each weeks bible study the comments oftentimes clarify what it is god really wants us to get out of the material for that week
7187143 i like most the interaction between other users of lifematters and the editor who posts on the blog
7187144 it is great to see how god is working with people involved in the study and how that interacts with the people who designed and wrote the material
7187145 pastor my husband had a heart attack last night and we took him to the hospital but he was dead on arrival i cant believe it has happened but we need your help i know he was not a church member but we would like for you to preach his funeral
7187146 know i am at peace with complete certainty i believe dad is standing watch prepared to guide me into the light
7187147 i always do what nana franscesa my great grandmother taught me to do when grieving light candles say prayers cook a meal for friends buy some flowers if i can find them fresh set up an altar wish the person well on their way home
7187148 deborah i hope you get there with ease and peace im sorry your way out of this world was so rocky that you were not treated with the grace and graciousness that every human being deserves
7187149 im praying that franscesa or someone very like her is there to greet you with a meal some flowers and some sweetness on the other side
7187150 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence
7187151 i like the fact that you show all races keep up the good work
7187152 in a medium that is usually muddled with lazy arguments and poor grammar your writing breaks through with a clarity that makes us all say
7187153 i read your site every day keeps me focused and honest
7187154 youre blog has inspired me to start my own thank you
7187155 wow great blog you have here keep up the good work
7187156 if youre looking for ethnic meat then youve come to the right place
7187157 i cant begin to describe how much i love your blog youre so fucking hillarious i could kiss you
7187158 i love your blog one of the few very few i will read all the way
7187159 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
7187160 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7187161 will include original handwritten parts and scores and complete published sets of music that are no longer in print
7187162 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7187163 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7187164 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7187165 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7187166 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7187167 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7187168 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7187169 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7187170 theres a lotta biz buzz back in hollyweird about you guys
7187171 no need to actually stop and think before the joke hits
7187172 just gross em out and make sure somebody drops trou give us crude sexual allusions and raw references to genitalia oh and we need an obnoxious drunken will ferrell like lummox at center stage thats comedy boys thats what makes a real knee slapper
7187173 some people come into our lives and easily go some stay for a while and leave foot prints in our hearts we are never the same
7187174 im a newbie at the convention so i plan to do a lot of listening
7187175 having 75 000 show up for an obama rally was pretty amazing
7187176 i look nationally and i see the tide is in our favor but weve got to bring it home and it is going to be tough
7187177 given all the horrible things weve had over the last eight years
7187178 we can go there and say ok you can talk a good game but what are you really going to do
7187179 he doesnt have to say anything about the hispanic community when he speaks you get the idea just from seeing him that ok were going to be part of the coalition
7187180 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7187181 joyau du lagon pos sur la barri re de corail face la baie de st vincent l lot t nia est un exemple de ce que la nature cal donienne peut offrir de plus beau des fonds de sable dun blanc blouissant un jardin de corail multicolore abritant une faune exceptionnelle tout pour combler les amoureux de la plong e
7187182 ik zie die sparkeling niet in je ogen die je altijd hebt
7187183 obama recognized the gap on national security and he recognized the need to get tougher on mccain and he chose the guy who can most quickly help him on both counts
7187184 we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this
7187185 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7187186 tu mets du lait dans le biberon mamie tchoutchou et tu mets dans le micro ondes apr s tu fais chauffer du chocolat et tu m langes dans le lait et tu secoues mamie tchoutchou

7187191 we dont want to be a part of the team that doesnt win a gold medal thats whats on our mind and what was on the newcomers minds this time around
7187192 i dont think theres ever been a team as deep and thats why usa basketball is in good hands
7187193 no matter who was on the court there was no letdown at times when the subs were made the level of play went up
7187194 when lisa fouled out initially you think wow lisa just fouled out then you see sylvia running to check in and everything is ok we just continued to come at teams
7187195 ive only been on two olympic teams but this team is pretty damn good
7187196 this is the most talented team with the least amount of preparation
7187197 are already meeting now in the bolivian chaco to try to take over the valves thats an assault on the bolivian people
7187198 this intended takeover of the valves is not an action against evo morales nor the government but against the bolivain people
7187199 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7187200 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt

7187214 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determinate guidelines for law enforcement
7187215 ive never experienced a member of congress who is pushing me to come up with more things he can do to advance human rights
7187216 they lead to the big cases and they lead to legislation very often
7187217 the presence of the nanoparticle can hinder the function of lung surfactant by affecting the interaction between the lipids and peptides
7187218 there is mounting evidence that very small particles have a greater negative impact on health than larger particles
7187219 nanoparticles emitted by diesel engines and other combustion sources are a health concern because of both their size and the carcinogens with which they are associated this problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is currently no effective regulatory control of these nanoparticles
7187220 it could help us reach the goal of engineering biofuel molecules to reduce emissions
7187221 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
7187222 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
7187223 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
7187224 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too
7187225 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot
7187226 if youre going to do quantum computing you have to be able to work with one electron at a time
7187227 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
7187228 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
7187229 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
7187230 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
7187231 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find
7187232 with our design the higher atomic scale resolution should make it easier to find
7187233 this is a proof of concept the technology im developing should allow researchers to practically and efficiently extract dozens of geometric and material properties of their microdevices just by electronically probing changes in capacitance or voltage
7187234 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas
7187235 after i narrow down to a particular design i then use finite element analysis for fine tuning finite element analysis is slow but it is able to model subtle physical phenomena that sugar doesnt do as well

7187239 this morning rovira told me he wanted an open and transparent investigation and thats why i accepted his resignation
7187240 timmy did not fall down that well lassie had him pushed
7187241 it was a little strange watching tv broadcast live pictures of the front of your house but thats part of it
7187242 one of the networks they were filming through the window of our house they were filming me in the kitchen making something to eat
7187243 i had given him my word that i would keep it in confidence so i did
7187244 he was very gracious in his call and said that he really appreciated getting to know me and held me in very high regard and wanted very much to work with me going forward both in the campaign and with his administration
7187245 its a bit like going through the political equivalent of a colonoscopy
7187246 they go over everything and anything and track down every crazy rumor and all sorts of stuff but the thing i would like to emphasize is it was an honor
7187247 what really matters is getting our country moving in a better direction
7187248 getting the economy turned around getting us out of iraq in a responsible way ending this dependency we have on imported oil which is so damaging look i like john mccain but i really think hes going to offer us more of the same and i think we need change
7187249 the people camped outside in the front of our house for the last three days i think that reminded everybody of the complete loss of any kind of normal life that you have once something like that happens but look they were up for it
7187250 ill be able to be a better dad and a better senator for the people of indiana and both of those things mean a lot to me

7187255 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7187256 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7187257 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7187258 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7187259 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7187260 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7187261 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7187262 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7187263 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7187264 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7187265 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7187266 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7187267 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7187268 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7187269 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7187270 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7187271 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7187272 its simply inexcusable and irresponsible for hallmark to glorify a lifestyle which has so many health risks

7187277 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7187278 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7187279 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7187280 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7187287 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7187288 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

7187294 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

7187297 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7187298 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7187301 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7187302 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7187303 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

7187308 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7187309 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7187310 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7187311 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7187312 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7187313 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7187314 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7187315 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7187316 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7187317 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7187318 vos sos la playa yo soy un gordo que perdi la malla
7187319 vos sos certeza yo soy una promesa de borracho en navidad
7187320 vos sos la gloria yo soy un club que est en convocatoria
7187321 i dont sound like this guy why dont i sound like this guy oh because he knows what hes doing no moron because you have a different voice ya know that thing that distinguishes writers from one another then how come his voice is so much better than mine not better just different yeah different if thats the case this guy is an angel singing some sophisticated madrigal while im an alley cat wailing my way around town looking for a hump and while were running with this analogy why the hell am i trying to sing the song in the first place
7187322 after watching the olympics it really motivated me to come here and get better times
7187323 i kind of remembered how michael phelps did it and tried to swim like him he is just so good
7187324 we have had unprecedented interest in auditions for swim teams
7187325 we are maxed out in four of eight practice groups and we expect to fill everything
7187326 we typically enjoy a membership spike the year after every olympics
7187327 we hope that will be larger than normal because of the phelps phenomenon
7187328 what he has done is so phenomenal and the way he has done it makes his appeal universal
7187329 it was really worth it to see him break that world record
7187330 we have a black population and there are some kids who gravitate to swimming because of race and identifying with cullen
7187331 the dogs are judged on how they meet the breed standards
7187332 its having fun with my dog and getting to say hes extra special
7187333 theyre not as popular today as golden retrievers or yellow labs
7187334 i train them and i hunt with them in wisconsin
7187335 daisy is full broke to hunt that means she will point at a bird and not touch it until i get there
7187336 its a last minute thing thats why it looks so shoddy
7187337 your letter begs forgiveness for something that happened over sixty years ago
7187338 i must say i know there are at least two sides in a divorce ive been there
7187339 if it had not been for her it would have been really hard to find him
7187340 he was ready to greet his daughter and i was like this is a perfect stranger
7187341 we both love each other and thats very obvious when you see us together
7187342 i finally have a daughter i can see and hold and love
7187343 it will be a whole new experience for me it should be quite exciting
7187344 if you call someone up and they hang up on you youre not prone to redial
7187345 we made a connection that just brought the last 60 years up front
7187346 i started from nothing and had a whole family all in one little letter
7187347 we eloped three days before he was deployed so im pretty excited to see him
7187348 weve moved to the suburbs and he hasnt even seen the house yet
7187349 this is the best feeling ive ever had in my life
7187350 there is a very large increase in the amount of attention being paid to these incidents
7187351 reporting across the board has gotten better in the last few years that pushes the numbers up
7187352 we have encouraged principals and other staff members to report incidents directly to the police department and to the school police as well
7187353 we want to make sure that every school provides a safe learning environment for students one incident is too many at the same time i think school districts are doing a good job in providing safe schools and working with law enforcement
7187354 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7187355 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7187356 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7187357 insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible
7187358 even though we may sin ultimately we deserve a second chance
7187359 sometimes life is worth living when you make sacrifices so others may benefit
7187360 i think the first two pictures took those ideas so seriously
7187361 we wanted to make sure we did that as well
7187362 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7187363 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7187364 o nee mama niet de kapper gel die doet zeer
7187365 waarom heeft emma een wit speldje ze heeft helemaal geen witte trui aan
7187366 zo lang heb ik nog n ooit eens een keer hoeven wachten
7187367 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7187368 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7187369 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7187370 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7187371 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7187372 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7187373 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7187374 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7187375 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7187376 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7187377 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7187378 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7187379 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7187380 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7187381 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7187382 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7187383 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7187384 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7187385 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7187386 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7187387 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7187388 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7187389 als iemand pest dan moet je stop hou op zeggen en als ie dan nog een keer pest dan moet je naar juf gaan en dan moet ie uit de kring
7187390 stop hou op oh ik zei stop hou op jij bent een pestkop mammaaaaaaa
7187391 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7187392 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7187393 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president
7187394 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7187395 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7187396 i think hes made a great pick with joe biden its not just foreign policy he has expertise in matters of the judiciary in his work for families
7187397 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7187398 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7187399 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7187400 barack obama demonstrated the judgment to choose a governing partner who is wise and strong and will help him deliver change to a country yearning for it i enthusiastically support the selection of senator biden
7187401 joe biden brings with him a record of voting in favor of tax increases strict gun control abortion rights and against domestic energy exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the opening of a nuclear waste repository such as yucca mountain
7187402 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans
7187403 he has distinguished himself as a member of the united states senate and is an accomplished public servant i wish him well in his bid for higher office but remain a supporter and ally of sen john mccain
7187404 joe brings experience to baracks message of change together democrats are offering the american people change experience and good judgment a winning combination if there ever was one
7187405 joe biden has always been my first choice and i am pleased to learn he is sen obamas first choice as well i am proud of joe and believe his experience in the u s senate and as a national leader in foreign policy makes him an excellent candidate for vice president
7187406 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7187407 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7187408 die justiz leistet hervorragende arbeit ich wei um die gro e arbeitsbelastung der richterinnen und staatsanw lte und staatsanw ltinnen in den budgetverhandlungen 2007 konnte ich erstmals in den letzten jahren eine aufstockung der planstellen f r die justiz erreichen nun werde ich den konkreten personalbedarf der bezirks und landesgerichte durch eine umfangreiche erhebung feststellen lassen um f r die n chsten budgetverhandlungen ger stet zu sein besonders erfreulich ist dass die standesvertretungen dieses projekt ausdr cklich unterst tzen
7187409 ich m chte nun den gezielten ressourceneinsatz in der justiz f rdern von herbst 2008 bis fr hjahr 2009 werden sich daher insgesamt rund 700 justizangeh rige bei einer detaillierten erhebung beteiligen die die arbeitsauslastung objektiv erfasst ergibt die auswertung eine auslastung von ber 100 prozent so werden wir ma nahmen dagegen setzen
7187410 hier hat die arbeitsbelastung durch die strafprozessreform und die verst rkte servicet tigkeit der justiz ombudsstellen in der letzten zeit besonders zugenommen auch andere bereiche wie die familiengerichtsbarkeit leiden unter einer sehr starken belastung meine verhandlungen um mehrere neue planstellen f r die oberlandesgerichte mit dem bundeskanzleramt waren zwar erfolgreich aber durch die neuwahlen und die nicht stattfindenden budgetverhandlungen sind diese neuen planstellen nun leider auf eis gelegt
7187411 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7187412 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7187413 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7187414 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7187415 we eloped three days before he was deployed so im pretty excited to see him
7187416 weve moved to the suburbs and he hasnt even seen the house yet
7187417 this is the best feeling ive ever had in my life
7187418 its a last minute thing thats why it looks so shoddy
7187419 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7187420 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7187421 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7187422 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7187423 i have people here that recognize me by my dog
7187424 she did a nice job and her prices are reasonable
7187425 its a delightful event and its good to see participation in glen ellyn
7187426 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7187427 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7187428 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7187429 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7187430 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7187431 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

7187443 a convergence of charismatic characters from every walk of life all of whom employ camp language with consummate skill
7187444 obviously its nice its just nice to see the defense play that well
7187445 if im correct i think we might have forced four turnovers and i thought we did a pretty nice job against the run and thats a really good running football team and i thought early in the game particularly they did a pretty nice job against the run we kept pressure on the passer i think we might have got five sacks so that was good to see and when you get a shutout like that it doesnt matter what the game is its nice
7187446 i always thought the shortest distance between two points is a straight line but he proved me wrong that just means i dont know anything about speed
7187447 the return was set up that way and he stuck with the return and did a nice job once he got the edge all of a sudden there was that other gear and thats what weve been talking to ted a lot about is just playing fast he was excited to be able to get his hands on a punt and he made the most of it
7187448 as an offense we were disappointed with that opening drive
7187449 we strongly believe that when you get it down that close youve got to punch it in for a touchdown luckily we were able to make up for it with a punt return for a touchdown and ted did a great job with that
7187450 at the same time we need to put that in the end zone and come away with the touchdown there were some really good things that happened there we had some really nice runs and the offensive line kept the pocket really clean and created some holes for ricky
7187451 those guys bowed up and played big that shows toughness not only physical toughness but mental toughness not throwing in the towel and not giving up its so easy to do in that line because most of the times nine times out of ten youre not going to win that one so i let them know i was proud of them
7187452 the offensive line hit their blocks right on the money and i saw it was going to be wide open on the left because they didnt have that many players to the left side
7187453 i peaked at the big high definition video screen a little bit and i eventually saw him out of the corner of my eye i should have thrown a stiff arm i get talked to about that in practice and thats something that i shouldve done but you learn from it
7187454 a convergence of charismatic characters from every walk of life all of whom employ camp language with consummate skill
7187455 i called dep but its taking a long time when is it going to get fixed
7187456 having more people who actually fix it would make me feel better
7187457 sometimes they think im a rolling 311 and they ask questions i cant answer like can i do something about the lady next door with all the cats
7187458 a convergence of charismatic characters from every walk of life all of whom employ camp language with consummate skill
7187459 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7187460 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7187461 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7187462 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7187463 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7187464 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7187465 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7187466 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7187467 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7187468 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7187469 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7187470 yo hab a comprado mi billete en internet pero el de otto que cuesta 60 euros por cada trayecto s lo te permiten pagarlo en el mostrador de spanair del aeropuerto luego tienes que facturar tus maletas y firmar un documento en el que renuncias a exigir cualquier indemnizaci n a la compa a si le ocurre algo al perro durante el trayecto
7187471 en la clase business te permiten hacer todos los cambios que quieras as que fui a la ventanilla de spanair y ped un billete para el vuelo posterior al del accidente que deb a despegar a las 14
7187472 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7187473 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7187474 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7187475 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7187476 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7187477 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7187478 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7187479 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7187480 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7187481 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7187482 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7187483 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7187484 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7187485 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7187486 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7187487 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7187488 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7187489 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7187490 were trying to be good naperville citizens and say heres a good thing we think it makes sense
7187491 its a thing for the region very much for naperville its in the first class thinking tradition of naperville i think it adds to the cultural life
7187492 asked the resulting amount be kicked back into construction of the theater
7187493 we need people who feel strongly this could be a wonderful project and the next riverwalk for naperville and the capstone to what is already a great city but its a one time opportunity
7187494 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7187495 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7187496 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7187497 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7187498 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7187499 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7187500 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7187501 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7187502 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7187503 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7187504 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7187505 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7187506 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7187507 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7187508 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7187509 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7187510 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7187511 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7187512 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7187513 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7187514 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7187515 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7187516 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7187517 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7187518 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7187519 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7187520 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7187521 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7187522 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7187523 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7187524 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7187525 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7187526 but i know he got a reason why im here amp i know he got a reason why you gone amp therefore im succeedin on my own but you aint never left me you still dwell in my heart i cant forget you kept it real from the start amp until my last breath i exhale ima keep you with me
7187527 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7187528 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7187529 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many
7187530 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7187531 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7187532 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7187533 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7187534 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7187535 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7187536 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7187537 a silver lining in these scandals is that infidelity is still scandalous this shows that all the efforts to discount bill clintons cheating as just sex didnt change the national perception or even democrats that fidelity matters
7187538 infidelity sexual or financial carries national security risks making a politician vulnerable to blackmail or criminal behavior to cover up his actions but it also betrays a lack of character and good judgment that he is willing to sacrifice everything that matters even people who depend on him for something not nearly as important
7187539 there are two trend lines that would indicate these concerns will not be a factor one the anxiety level in the public is so deep and serious right now that some of the trivial sensational issues are not going to have the impact they had in the past
7187540 the second thing is that its a mistake to think the public only sees imperfection and failings of just the other side both parties have their share of peccadilloes for every eliott spitzer and john edwards theres a larry craig or a mark foley

7187543 he loved living in the lower ninth ward its rhythm was his rhythm despite the danger the violence it was their place it belonged to the people in the ninth ward and they knew it and they managed as they could and they were proud to have made lives there no one had ever promised them of all people that life was going to be easy or without a daily struggle and there at least they took pride that it was their own struggle
7187544 friends had been robbed at knife point others had had their houses burglarized or cars stolen or vandalized there was fear involved in walking the streets at night even in their quiet neighborhood the public schools were overwhelmingly lousy the infrastructure was decaying
7187545 craig had found noting less than himself in new orleans
7187546 they had heard it all before and most of the time it turned out to be a false alarm the regular challenge made them defiant especially in the working class neighborhoods the poorer the neighborhood and the harder people had to fight to stand their ground over the years the less likely they were to jump ship and head for higher ground even if they had the means to do so
7187547 evacuating was expensive it cost money for gas money for hotel rooms those who had family had a leg up but if you didnt have the cousin in baton rouge or brookhaven or mccomb or holly springs it was a hotel and it was expensive not just the hotel but eating out every meal

7187578 so now these five things must apply to him he must humble himself he must again hunger after god he must be committed to holiness to honour god to honour church and to honour everybody in the community
7187579 he must also have a heart to heal his own brokenness before he can ever reach out to the brokenness of others

7187584 motorists are supposed to obey the law by stopping when they see a pedestrian in a crosswalk but they dont always remember to do that
7187585 we are extremely pleased with the enhancers operation here in st petersburg and our citizens have been quick to adopt them
7187586 over the years ive seen people make mad dashes across midlothian road
7187587 but since the units went in theres been a huge improvement in the reaction of the motorists in yielding i think youre going to find that this is going to be a new wave of pedestrian assistance
7187588 we feel it is the best product on the table right now for crosswalk safety short of a traffic signal
7187589 we strongly encourage its consideration for other communities with pedestrian crosswalk issues
7187590 god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
7187591 i came that they might have life and might have it abundantly
7187592 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
7187593 god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
7187594 christ died for our sins he was buried he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures he appeared to peter then to the twelve after that he appeared to more than five hundred
7187595 jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me
7187596 as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god even to those who believe in his name
7187597 by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not as a result of works that no one should boast
7187598 behold i stand at the door and knock if any one hears my voice and opens the door i will come in to him

7187630 the wheelchair bound patient was sure she had parkinsons disease but by the end of one session she was jogging down the hall a man dies of cancer yet the autopsy showed there were not enough cancerous spots in his body to have killed him a priest administers the last rites to the wrong patient and that patient dies unexpectedly these patients all had different diagnoses yet they were all affected by the same cause it has been proven that fear can cause disease and even death though this idea is not new our understanding of it is progressing because of new technologies that give us a window into the brain the underlying ancient concept formalized decades ago by dr robert k merton can be found in greek mythological stories and elsewhere merton further refined its definition and named it the self fulfilling prophecy according to this construct once a prophecy or fact is predicted events are set into motion that work together to bring it to pass these events can occur within a persons psyche or develop as part of the situation from which the prophetic statement sprang
7187631 yeah that is mean im gonna remember it and use it in real life
7187632 they played with up they hit them they got hit they popped back up and i was really pleased youre never happy to lose a game but i was pleased with the effort we put into the match
7187633 when you come into up on their home field against a team i have such tremendous respect for you know its going to be a battle
7187634 i saw stoltenberg streaking down the side and you know when you see her she is going to deliver a ball
7187635 i kind of faded far post and made my run near post and stolt delivered a perfect ball and i decided i was going to put some power behind the ball and if i was going to hit the post it was going to come right back so i just hit the ball a little bit harder and luckily it went right past the keeper
7187636 i think for her first game i cant imagine a more intimidating setting to go into and she was a little bit nervous but she really came out on top and made a couple nice saves well look for her to get more comfortable but that was all i could ask for and more for a freshman stepping into goal for the first time
7187637 i think we just learned that we can play with those teams that are ranked higher
7187638 it was so fun tonight it was a little nerve wracking but im pretty excited about this team and the players we have

7187645 sewaktu saya jadi pensyarah di luar negara ada juga orang yang tawarkan saya jawatan yang tinggi tapi itu saya tak mahu
7187646 jika benar seperti yang dikatakannya anwar bahawa ada hartawan dari negara arab sanggup melabur sebanyak rm5 bilion semata mata kerana dia kenapa pelaburan itu tidak diberi kepada pembangunan rakyat semasa isterinya wan azizah menjawat jawatan ahli parlimen
7187647 kenapa pula wang tersebut tidak dibahagikan kepada lima negeri pembangkang atau jelas itu hanya satu penipuan terhadap rakyat
7187648 jika benar beliau berniat untuk menjaga kepentingan rakyat kenapa sewaktu beliau menjadi wakil rakyat permatang pauh selama tiga penggal dahulu permatang pauh tidak dimajukan
7187649 pemimpin pemimpin pas jangan lagi bermimpi pada siang hari untuk memerintah negara ini jika mereka tidak mempunyai kemampuan kalau anda tidak mempunyai rancangan untuk pembangunan rakyat tiada mempunyai kemampuan pengalaman dan tiada ketokohan usahlah berangan angan kosong apakah rancangan pembangunan yang pernah dikemukakan oleh pas untuk kebaikan rakyat ketika parti itu menjadi anggota komponen barisan nasional dulu sejak dulu hingga sekarang pas hanya mampu membuat janji untuk menegakkan itu dan ini dalam ceramahnya tetapi apabila habis ceramah mereka akan balik tidur dan kemudian berceramah dan membuat janji lagi pada malam malam berikutnya itu saja
7187650 dap kini tidak perlu memperjuangkan matlamat politiknya dan hanya bertindak sebagai remote control untuk menyuarakan hasrat mereka melalui pemimpin melayu iaitu anwar
7187651 hal ini terbukti apabila anwar sendiri menyokong projek ternakan babi berpusat di sepang yang boleh menjadikan malaysia pengeksport babi terbesar di dunia menyokong supaya kuota 10 peratus universiti teknologi mara uitm dibuka kepada bukan melayu dan sebagainya
7187652 anwar juga pernah mengeluarkan kenyataan bertulis bahawa jika beliau menjadi perdana menteri beliau akan menghapuskan dasar ekonomi baru
7187653 saya tak mahu sumpah sebab ulama arab yusof qardhawi iaitu kawan baik saya ada telefon saya dia kata anwar ana sokong kamu kamu jangan susah hati ana dah buat solat hajat kamu jangan sumpah jangan bagi dna kamu ikut mahkamah syariah sahaja
7187654 kalau ulama mengatakan demikian mahkamah syariah itu adalah jalan saya saya dah rujuk mahkamah syariah sebulan sudah kerana saya nak ikut islam

7187712 mark andreessen no dave winer hell no joel spolsky oh hell no
7187713 the rewards are in your head the reward is invisible its what you like to do
7187714 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
7187715 shes running around talking about how this is an insult to sportsmen like shes annie oakley hillary clinton is out there like shes out in the duck blind every sunday
7187716 i cant remember the last time i saw so many real world complaints concentrated in one place
7187717 tick off your customers in ebays case it is the sellers because the sellers pay all the fees not the buyers and shortly you will have to close shop because you will have destroyed your business
7187718 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7187719 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7187720 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7187721 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7187722 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7187723 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7187724 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7187725 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7187726 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7187727 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7187728 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7187729 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7187730 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7187731 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7187732 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7187733 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7187734 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7187735 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7187736 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7187737 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7187738 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7187739 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7187740 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7187741 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7187742 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7187743 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7187744 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7187745 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7187746 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7187747 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7187748 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7187749 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7187750 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7187751 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7187752 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7187753 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7187754 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7187755 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7187756 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7187757 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7187758 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7187759 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7187760 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7187761 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7187762 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7187763 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7187764 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7187765 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7187766 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7187767 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7187768 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7187769 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7187770 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7187771 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7187772 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7187773 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7187774 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7187775 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7187776 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7187777 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7187778 to have an equal partner in everything we do sort of plucked up and taken away is very overwhelming
7187779 if a soldier is worried about the health and safety of his wife and children back home he is a danger to himself and his unit
7187780 that is a huge huge lift in comfort to our soldiers in knowing that their families are being taken care of at home
7187781 when i woke up i about fell down the stairs because i thought it was a mistake it was so much more than we had hoped for
7187782 my thing is if you give some back you get more out of it
7187783 they need everything from glue to paper to calculators there is just so much to get i just want to eliminate some of that grief and headache
7187784 i didnt think it was going to happen or if it did i was going to have to put up all of my own money
7187785 but i havent really had to spend a dime aside from some paper plates everything has been donated
7187786 i just want things to go back to what i remember
7187787 i want them to succeed im tired of riding around elyria and seeing kids doing nothing im doing what i can to deter future kids from doing the same
7187788 and if its a success it wont be the last time i do something like this i just want to get kids excited about school again
7187789 dna onderzoek bewijst wensvader ook echte vader baby d aanvraag van informatie bij hoofd van de gyneacologie in uz leuven gasthuisberg
7187790 de strijd leek toen verloren maar nu hebben we weer hoop
7187791 nu staat het zwart op wit baby d is mijn dochtertje mijn vrouw en ik hebben er recht op ons kind kwam illegaal bij de koopouders terecht door het getalm van het nederlandse gerecht duurde het twee jaar voor het dna onderzoek uitsluitsel kon geven
7187792 draagmoeders geven een koppel die dolgraag een kind willen hebben om de een of andere reden geen kind ter wereld kunnen brengen
7187793 dit zijn vrouwen die zich laten zwanger maken met het sperma van de wensvader of een eitje en een zaadje van de wensouders laten inplanten en het kind dan niet geven aan de wensouders waarvan het sperma of implantaat kwam maar ze dan doorverkopen aan wensouders die er meer geld voor bieden zie bijvoorbeeld naar de zaak van baby donna dit vindt ik niet kunnen
7187794 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7187795 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7187796 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7187797 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7187798 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7187799 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7187800 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7187801 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7187802 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7187803 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7187804 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7187805 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7187806 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7187807 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7187808 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7187809 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7187810 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7187811 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7187812 this is a planning took where all things are going
7187813 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7187814 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7187815 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7187816 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7187817 hes fixed and got a clean bill of health at the veterinarian and he has his tags he loves the water and has his own little swimming pool he loves car rides and hes very gentle
7187818 id give them one because i feel bad the little girl lost her dog
7187819 theres so many animals out there that need to be adopted its ridiculous this man would be so selfish to have to have this one
7187820 being gay and diving are completely separate parts of my life of course theres going to be crossover because some people have issues but everyone i dive with has been so supportive
7187821 im happy with myself and where i am im very happy with who i am and what ive done

7187829 ya se habl de eso y creo que es la mejor manera de reducir el ligamento engrosado ya me estoy mentalizando para una artroscopia pero primero hay que saber qu dicen los estudios y qu deciden los m dicos
7187830 con la kinesiolog a y los analg sicos se redujo el dolor puedo caminar aunque no subir una escalera o una cuesta empinada en la jugada sa donde me volv a lesionar sent el mismo dolor que en la finales con los spurs

7187850 fuck this im outta here i feel sorry for the guy who lives across the hall from you
7187851 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7187852 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7187853 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7187854 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7187855 ah pero esta elecci n est tica nos debe estar hablando de una puesta en escena pensada de forma conceptual
7187856 a collection of western academics and journalists have busied themselves with the task of informing everyone of the falsity of the claim
7187857 the islamic republic has never threatened and will never threaten any country
7187858 took the wind out of the sails of the left wing activists who were seeking to create a provocation
7187859 these are professional provocateurs and we did not want to cooperate with that on the open seas
7187860 instead of letting the entire international press obsess about this for a week the boats received almost no coverage simply because there was no confrontation
7187861 theyve got a reputation for protecting terrorists and acting as human shields
7187862 if you receive gods victory and you witness people joining islam in great numbers thank your god and ask him to forgive you for god is very merciful
7187863 muqtada dont worry we will sacrifice our blood for the you
7187864 i visited this city when my father was alive and i will visit this city on this day every year do not believe in rumors verify them with us first
7187865 the whole world stood against america and the us ignored it likewise the us will ignore the opinion of the iraqi people and it will compose the new government according to its own desires
7187866 i dont want the chair of the government because it will be controlled by the us and i dont want to be controlled by the us
7187867 the badr corps have 10 000 or 12 000 supporters while three quarters of iraq are soldiers of sadr the iraqi people dont follow any marja but my father the followers of sadr dont like hakim because he betrayed the people of basra and the south when he urged them to fight in the 1991 intifada and didnt come in to help them causing the intifada to fail the badr forces came from the outside and do not represent the people
7187868 i will fight america when muhamad al mahdi the 12th leader of the shiites who disappeared and will return to save them will appear because this is the land of muhamad al mahdi and they occupy his land
7187869 if jews reside in iraq then they will become iraqi citizens and they will own iraq and we will be their guests
7187870 this happened when the jews came and the americans and others became their guests
7187871 the mahdi will be coming soon and when he comes he will kill the jewish leadership
7187872 iraqis of all religions and sects refuse to watch half naked women on television
7187873 facing the arrests and assassinations from our common enemy and do not let them tell you that we have many enemies we only have one implying the americans
7187874 america benefited from the events in karbala to make a war against me
7187875 even if they establish a government i will not be a part of it
7187876 the american veto makes the iraqi governing council unimportant but if it removes its veto i will support it
7187877 the iraqi governing council appoints american woman as iraqi ambassador to us
7187878 we are still under the rule of saddam hussein but with an american face
7187879 one of the successes of americas occupation here is the distribution of moral corruption by selling the pornographic movies and liquor and hashish that america brought with it to iraq they are showing pornographic movies in the cinemas and people are drinking alcohol in the streets and showing bad and immoral movies on the hebrew media network a reference to the american established iraqi media network and hura tv a us government produced television station and even in childrens movies in order to create a new generation that is far from the islamic religion and has western ideologies that do not oppose the anglo american zionist ideology we ask the governing council about these malicious operations against islam and why they do not prevent them
7187880 killing policemen in faluja even though they knew they were police
7187881 stop protecting the occupation forces from the iraqi armed resistance
7187882 america is untrustworthy and this is why irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called it the big devil because it came specifically to destroy islam and to halt the export of the islamic revolution from iran
7187883 american forces have started throwing their dead into the sea fearing public opinion in america and also fearing that people will vote against the young george w bush in the next elections
7187884 watch the iranian sahar channel which specializes in islamic programming because it shows the real aims of american politics and the hidden truth of the british and their goals after us secretary of state colin powell failed in the united nations he came to iraq to represent the american leadership of the coalition forces and to visit the areas attacked with chemical weapons in order to harm the people they want to show that america is the peacemaker of the world america hates islam and muslims as proven by the american slogan the war against terror
7187885 a secret movement joined with the zionists and possessing millions of soldiers throughout the world of all nations and religions and it takes over the weak minds and weak spirits who have no religion it is founded by jews and it aims to destroy all other religions
7187886 everyone knows that the west is a bitter enemy to islam no sane man can believe that america supports the interests of muslims
7187887 the many insults against religious figures statements denigrating the religion of muslims the perversion of anything said by muslims to make it sound like they support terrorism
7187888 a zionist christian follower of us president george bush because bremer is as foolish as the man who sent him he thought that it would be easy to erase islam from the souls of 25 million people in iraq and complete his and the wests desire to erase islam from the earth does this third rate intelligence agent and terrorism expert think he can erase the religion of god bremer does not know more than the intelligence officers of the previous regime who tried to remove islam from the hearts and minds of men and women whose faith was strengthened as a reaction bremer is foolish because he failed in the goal of trying to erase islam from the lives of people who lived with and by islam for many centuries these people were only defeated when they strayed from islam
7187889 he who witnesses a bad deed must change it with force if he cannot he must try giving advice if he cannot he must try to change it with his heart

7187920 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7187921 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7187922 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government and to follow their cases closely
7187923 how fast they were going out was way too hard
7187924 if i would have went out with those guys i would have died
7187925 i wasnt quite as fit as ive been in the past
7187926 i did all the training did the best i could sometimes everything clicks and it goes great and sometimes it doesnt
7187927 it is sort of cheeky of us if you dont try you never know
7187928 we have a seven member board we have a lot of talent
7187929 theres not anything for seniors or anyplace to go out here a lot dont like to drive at night we need a place to play cards watch tv and get together with peers
7187930 once we get a senior center we can offer more things
7187931 den kollektive trafik skal styrkes markant hvis toget skal blive et attraktivt alternativ til bilen skal vi have hurtigere togforbindelser mellem landsdelene s det vil vi have meget fokus p
7187932 det kr ver en opgradering af hastigheden p visse str kninger fra 150 til 200 kilometer i timen og derfor vil vi have meget fokus p investeringer i skinner og signalsystem
7187933 det er rigtig vigtigt ud fra et milj sp rgsm l en togtur p kun tre timer fra aalborg til k benhavn g r indenrigsflyvning mindre attraktivt og vil flytte flere bilister over i toget

7187935 p vejnettet har vi brug for en akut indsats ved vejle fjord k ge bugt og p str kningen over vestfyn
7187936 when i look at the defense its hard to find a lot of positives to be honest with you
7187937 the thing that we did extremely well was get turnovers turnovers kept us in the game and gave us a chance to win
7187938 we didnt tackle very well weve got to do a lot better job
7187939 if anyone did get one now it wouldnt count anyway but when we get to the real 16 weve got to get it done
7187940 thats a thing that concerns me romo was able to hold the ball too long
7187941 its easy for me to say we have to get it fixed
7187942 i like to think of it as pressuring the passer we didnt give up any sacks friday night either but they did make us get rid of that ball very quickly a lot with some of the things they did
7187943 n d kalu has done some good things hes the best finisher in the pass rush were searching for complements to those players were looking at a lot of guys
7187944 we arent going to panic and start zero blitzing people to try to make the quarterback get rid of the ball if we start to do that then i dont think were going to be a very good defensive team
7187945 were trying to stay committed to what were doing through preseason trying to find the guys who can help us
7187946 it would be easy for him to get frustrated because a lot of attention is being paid to him
7187947 he was doubled and tripled sometimes he still found ways to get there
7187948 offensively the big bright spots were the play of taylor and slaton
7187949 they played against a good team and they rose to the occasion
7187950 they played well in pass protection which is something weve been concerned about dallas came after us blitzing a lot too they didnt give up a sack they ran extremely well and both of them got better as the game went on

7187953 and a smaller downtown means we can create more intimate night celebrations
7187954 senior volunteers with the power and the authority to make decisions have to be able to confront and solve unforeseen problems
7187955 their budget for those opening ceremonies 68 million was more than our budget for all of our ceremonies
7187956 but we have wonderfully creative people at work i think everyone will be impressed with the vancouver experience
7187957 its easy to spin it however you want to its time for us to get behind this sport and talk about the good things
7187958 i couldnt stop thinking about it its hard i worked for four years at least now i have something positive to think about i have to say it was good we won more medals on the womens side than in how many years im really proud of the team and the fact we ended up on a high note
7187959 a lot of things happened at the olympics a lot of us werent expecting
7187960 i didnt use the relay as redemption i pushed aside what happened in the open 400 and i wanted to finish off what the first three runners did

7187965 australia was very scrappy and physical but we kept our composure

7187989 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7187990 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7187991 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7187992 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7187993 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7187994 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7187995 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7187996 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7187997 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7187998 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7187999 until carter ruck and partners and englands stifling libel laws got to work the few american journalists not caught up in obama mania were turning to the archives of the british press to answer an intriguing question who is
7188000 a libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss damage is presumed
7188001 as far as he can remember he has had no direct contact with mr obama
7188002 mr rezkos lawyer said his client had longstanding indebtedness to mr auchis general mediterranean holding gmh by june 2007 he owed it 27 9 million under a loan forgiveness agreement described in court m auchi lent mr rezko 3 5 million in april 2005 and 11 million in september 2005 as well as 3 5 million transferred in april 2007 that agreement provided for the outstanding loans to be forgiven in return for a stake in the 62 acre riverside park development
7188003 mr auchi first met mr rezko after the 2003 iraq war and they have a business relationship
7188004 mr auchi was convicted of corruption given a suspended sentence and fined 1 4 million in france in 2003 for his part in the elf affair described as the biggest political and corporate scandal in post war europe he in a statement from his media lawyers claims he is appealing against the sentence
7188005 a 2004 pentagon report obtained by the washington times identified auchi as a global arms dealer and iraqi billionaire who behind the facade of legitimate business served as saddam husseins principle sic international financial manipulator and bag man
7188006 the report to the pentagon inspector general stated that significant and credible evidence has been developed that nadhmi auchi has engaged in unlawful activities working closely with iraqi intelligence operatives to bribe foreign governments and individuals prior to operation iraqi freedom to turn opinion against the american led mission to remove saddam hussein
7188007 have written to ask us to remove middle east online april 23 celebrates the removal of the six articles with
7188008 another publisher is now shortly to be sued over false material it is publishing on the internet having failed to heed a warning letter a fulsome apology injunction and substantial damages will be sought against it
7188009 the libel lawyer peter carter ruck who died on friday had a chilling effect on the media he was a chancer out for the maximum fee and he did for freedom of speech what the boston strangler did for door to door salesmen he established the idea that libel law was complicated and merited very high fees in the process he became very rich i like to bill the clients as the tears are flowing he told me
7188010 the name nadhmi auchi was just another name for saddams intelligence service or so we thought said nibras kazimi a former iraqi dissident who is now a visiting scholar at the hudson institute in washington d c
7188011 mr auchi is a business partner of syrian born businessman antoin tony rezko who has supported mr obama financially since his first run for the illinois state senate in 1996
7188012 in 1996 according to european news accounts belgiums ambassador to luxembourg charged that banque continentale du luxembourg a bank that nadhmi auchi and paribas jointly controlled until 1994 had handled personal accounts for former dictator of iraq saddam hussein
7188013 auchi has been able to collect british politicians the way other people collect stamps
7188014 on the 20th anniversary of his business in 1999 mr auchi received a greeting card signed by 130 politicians including tony blair william hague and charles kennedy who were then leaders of their respective parties
7188015 obama bagman is sent to jail over 3 5m payment by british tycoon
7188016 the united kingdom has become a popular venue for defamation plaintiffs from around the world because under english law it is not necessary for a libel plaintiff to prove falsity or actual malice as is required in the united states
7188017 ala is concerned that foreign libel lawsuits threaten u s authors and publishers and our freedoms of speech and the press through its chilling effect such venue shopping also denies the american people the right to read and to access information another inherent first amendment right essential to our democratic form of government
7188018 a presidential candidate must be prepared to face extraordinary levels of scrutiny if obama and his supporters think they can silence questions about his background his leftist terror bomber backers his god damn america pastor his cocaine use his financial dealings with indicted syrian born businessman tony rezko or with saddam hussein crony and oil for food banker nadhmi auchi they are mistaken
7188019 out of step with allies u s defends freedom to offend in speech
7188020 the magazine should be forbidden from saying similar things forced to publish a rebuttal and made to compensate muslims for injuring their dignity feelings and self respect
7188021 it is not clear to me that the europeans are mistaken when they say that a liberal democracy must take affirmative responsibility for protecting the atmosphere of mutual respect against certain forms of vicious attack
7188022 preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
7188023 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7188024 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7188025 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7188026 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7188027 try to use that word or those words more often
7188028 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7188029 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7188030 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7188031 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7188032 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7188033 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7188034 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7188035 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7188036 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7188037 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7188038 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7188039 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7188040 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7188041 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7188042 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7188043 oh i dont have change for a fifty just come back by later and pay
7188044 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7188045 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7188046 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7188047 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7188048 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7188049 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7188050 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7188051 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7188052 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7188053 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7188054 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7188055 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7188056 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7188057 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7188058 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7188059 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants

7188096 this young couple had to work awful hard and do without to provide care for their family but they would never complain in front of anyone
7188097 all i can remember them saying is a mr ferguson asked my dad to be a caretaker of the island
7188098 we would be the only family there except for the boys camp the boys would only be there during the summer months these were college kids who camped on the island
7188099 thats where the bridge is going over to the island now where weirton steels coke processing plant was built and that was built to force water around the channel for the riverboats
7188100 the northern tip of the island straight across from browns island is where our house was built the 1936 flood swept it away from that same tip straight across the river to the ohio side and across old route 7 in an alcove was a little store the store was called the oasis it sold what people would need on their travels plus bread and milk its no longer there today even the alcove is gone the new route 7 changed the whole scenery
7188101 our new house was built side by side to the old farmhouse
7188102 then we would have a big hot dog roast all workers were invited
7188103 we camped like this until the house was finished us kids thought it was great
7188104 when there was no more work that mom and us kids could do the men plowed us a garden to work in
7188105 it even had papaw trees and all kinds of berries
7188106 to live along a river or on an island you had to keep in mind to expect floods this was the reasoning for our house to be built on stilts with no basement remember this is in the 1930s
7188107 there was no barrier to hold back the flooding water the dam in stratton was not built until sometime in the 1950s there was a dike at the north end of the island you had to be very careful in crossing over it we had to learn that old man river was the boss he was in full control at all times you better obey there was the good possibility that you would not get a second chance
7188108 that bull used to chase us all over the island
7188109 i can remember one time being in there and looking out through the curtain and here comes the bull i took off running for the house
7188110 we had no hot or cold running water in the house there was cistern water with a pump and we had to walk a good ways to get the water and walk back to the house with the buckets of water
7188111 at night kerosene oil lamps were burned for lighting during the daylight hours we had to make sure the lamp chimneys were cleaned the wicks were trimmed and there would be plenty of box matches in the house we had a coal or woodburning stove for cooking heating the house was done the same way by a pot belly stove in the middle of the rooms other daylight chores were to make sure the wood boxes were full for the stoves and ashes cleaned out these were just a few of the things to keep us kids busy and out of trouble
7188112 after dad was killed by a drunk driver our family fell apart
7188113 we didnt have it easy and neither did he bob all because of a drunk driver
7188114 we looked at experienced players that might be available but there are few around and certainly no one who suited our needs
7188115 in liam we have a promising half and a new zealander as well who will come back home to build up our options and compete for an nrl spot
7188116 we also have isaac john from our successful junior warriors side like liam hell be ineligible for the nyc next year and hell also be pushing for an nrl job
7188117 pulling out now would badly dent new zealands good reputation in pakistan and cannot be justified on security grounds
7188118 new zealand cricket should not be panicked by the suicide bombings in pakistan this week the danger of anything happening to our cricketers is minimal

7188129 why is nato closing its arms around us do they want to hug us and nurture us or do they have something sinister in mind if not marriage is it rape
7188130 bitter resentment in the humiliated soul of russia and no one nursed the grudge so fiercely as vladimir v putin mr putin is in this sense of grievance a man of his people as visitors to the new york times web site can see in the sampling of breast beating commentary from russian bloggers
7188131 why is nato closing its arms around us do they want to hug us and nurture us or do they have something sinister in mind if not marriage is it rape

7188133 keep an eye on raw boned and aggressive ryan braddock who makes his 2nd sd appearance this friday night in time i think braddock will turn heads
7188134 its sad to see flair advertised for some low rent wrestling shows at this stage of his life
7188135 he should really be above that i dont know what his take will be in 12 months but unless its significantly above the half million dollars he was making from vince mcmahon i just dont understand what hes trying to accomplish
7188136 im not saying flair shouldnt take advantage of his earning potential right now and i hope he makes millions in whatever he does but seeing him in these ads for every rinky dink out there just makes him look ancient instead of being relevant which he still can be
7188137 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7188138 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7188139 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7188140 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7188141 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7188142 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7188143 my public profile is inextricably linked to my pow experiences
7188144 the audacity to believe despite all the evidence to the contrary that we could restore a sense of community to a nation torn by conflict
7188145 it was that pervasive spirit of hope that tied my own familys story to the larger american story
7188146 my public profile is inextricably linked to my pow experiences
7188147 the audacity to believe despite all the evidence to the contrary that we could restore a sense of community to a nation torn by conflict
7188148 it was that pervasive spirit of hope that tied my own familys story to the larger american story
7188149 this young couple had to work awful hard and do without to provide care for their family but they would never complain in front of anyone
7188150 all i can remember them saying is a mr ferguson asked my dad to be a caretaker of the island
7188151 we would be the only family there except for the boys camp the boys would only be there during the summer months these were college kids who camped on the island
7188152 thats where the bridge is going over to the island now where weirton steels coke processing plant was built and that was built to force water around the channel for the riverboats
7188153 the northern tip of the island straight across from browns island is where our house was built the 1936 flood swept it away from that same tip straight across the river to the ohio side and across old route 7 in an alcove was a little store the store was called the oasis it sold what people would need on their travels plus bread and milk its no longer there today even the alcove is gone the new route 7 changed the whole scenery
7188154 our new house was built side by side to the old farmhouse
7188155 then we would have a big hot dog roast all workers were invited
7188156 we camped like this until the house was finished us kids thought it was great
7188157 when there was no more work that mom and us kids could do the men plowed us a garden to work in
7188158 it even had papaw trees and all kinds of berries
7188159 to live along a river or on an island you had to keep in mind to expect floods this was the reasoning for our house to be built on stilts with no basement remember this is in the 1930s
7188160 there was no barrier to hold back the flooding water the dam in stratton was not built until sometime in the 1950s there was a dike at the north end of the island you had to be very careful in crossing over it we had to learn that old man river was the boss he was in full control at all times you better obey there was the good possibility that you would not get a second chance
7188161 that bull used to chase us all over the island
7188162 i can remember one time being in there and looking out through the curtain and here comes the bull i took off running for the house
7188163 we had no hot or cold running water in the house there was cistern water with a pump and we had to walk a good ways to get the water and walk back to the house with the buckets of water
7188164 at night kerosene oil lamps were burned for lighting during the daylight hours we had to make sure the lamp chimneys were cleaned the wicks were trimmed and there would be plenty of box matches in the house we had a coal or woodburning stove for cooking heating the house was done the same way by a pot belly stove in the middle of the rooms other daylight chores were to make sure the wood boxes were full for the stoves and ashes cleaned out these were just a few of the things to keep us kids busy and out of trouble
7188165 after dad was killed by a drunk driver our family fell apart
7188166 we didnt have it easy and neither did he bob all because of a drunk driver
7188167 a lot of people have things passed down to them from relatives and have no idea what things are worth
7188168 we want to help them understand what some of those things hidden away are worth
7188169 weve had very positive reaction from the public about this
7188170 its a great thing for people to show enthusiasm about this stuff its been pretty steady all day
7188171 so youre probably talking about 20 per cent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than 2 or 3 per cent
7188172 there are people out there that have information that we still need
7188173 the two that have been arrested may have or not spoken with friends associates about what occurred on that night and wed like to hear from anyone that has information
7188174 we would prefer these persons contact us rather than we go to them
7188175 this doesnt bring john back but it does give the family answers to some questions theyve probably had
7188176 the family have been supportive of the investigation and very pleased with the result today
7188177 police inquiries are being made to determine the criminal liability of any other parties who may be involved
7188178 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7188179 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7188180 she walked out the front door and i walked out after her
7188181 and she said she was just gonna go kill herself go stand in front of a train or something so im sitting there im screaming at her like no what are you doing why would you do that and she just kept walking didnt turn around or nothing didnt stop i thought that she was really gonna do it
7188182 he loved being at practice he listened he was very coachable all the kids on the team looked up to him because of his ability
7188183 everyone called him the salamander because everyone just slipped off him
7188184 the only one thats going to stop david is david
7188185 he always listened and did what we asked him to
7188186 its just that he had some problems in other parts of his life
7188187 the only one thats going to stop david is david
7188188 while they may be back at work theyre back at work stuck
7188189 they dont want to live in a place where theres crappy living circumstances
7188190 they dont want to live in a drug infested area they dont want to raise their children in that
7188191 for the majority of the people out there they were doing the best they could and would take the resources we offered
7188192 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
7188193 union a union between man and woman between one man and one woman thats my definition of marriage
7188194 are we going to get back to the importance of supreme court justices
7188195 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
7188196 for me as a christian its also a sacred union gods in the mix but uh
7188197 i strongly support preserving the unique status of marriage between man and woman
7188198 im a federalist i believe that the state should make those decisions
7188199 that doesnt mean that they dont have the rights of all citizens im not saying that i am saying that we should preserve the unique status of marriage between one man and one woman and if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the state should make the decisions within their own states
7188200 because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution its been a matter of state law that has been our tradition
7188201 the reason people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment is some people believe is because of the concern about same sex marriage i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions
7188202 i do believe that for gay partners to want to visit each other in the hospital for the state to say you know what thats alright i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage is i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or different view
7188203 strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
7188204 proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench
7188205 but when it comes to the programs that are federally funded
7188206 we do have to be careful to make sure we are not creating a situation where people are being discriminated against using federal money
7188207 across 42 states and into at least four foreign countries
7188208 we estimate that ms13 already has as many as 10 000 members but the gang is focused on recruiting even more members and is targeting middle school and high school students
7188209 there are lots of new families because boys and girls get married and decide that they will maybe take over mom and dads house
7188210 i see new names in the town that i dont know who they are anymore but if i dig around a bit i find out that oh thats daughter and i know her thats the way life goes here
7188211 protection against the indians tribes including the miami of ohio delaware erie seneca and munsie
7188212 we had people living in the area who were trying to establish farms and so on and when the indians went on the war path they had to have some place to run for safety there was a line of them along the river valley the white man was taking the indians land and the indians were retaliating
7188213 there wasnt really too much going on and i think the todd brothers were maybe disappointed
7188214 most people who were in and out of freeport then were river men
7188215 nothing was wilder than freeport back when the lumber men were coming down the river
7188216 keep in mind these people had been up in the mountains all winter logging and they were a wild group
7188217 most everybody raised their own food in the backyard and some farmers shipped their produce down to pittsburgh on barges
7188218 some people were known to have lived in the countryside someplace and they built themselves a boat they would wait until spring and they would load it up with lumber and take it back to pittsburgh they would sell off the logs sell off the boat and walk home
7188219 it was just pretty much like it was before the war
7188220 what i remember was just playing with all my friends in the neighborhoods
7188221 the kids in the country they never understood that because you have to have a curb
7188222 we all bought our appliances there when you got married they gave you credit
7188223 you could pay as little as you wanted if you had to
7188224 i think the plazas and malls have taken people away from the community and small businessmen just cant make a living anymore
7188225 everybody has a car two cars three cars and they choose to go to the bigger stores
7188226 like all small towns you cant compete against the big people the grocers were hit pretty hard
7188227 you never had enough money it was always a day late and a dollar short
7188228 we had some homes remodeled and some streets fixed up
7188229 when people saw that we were taking things down they kept asking when are we going to build them back up well it takes time through the years we got a lot of things accomplished
7188230 everybody was peaceful the community came together and did everything together
7188231 i got off and came down to where the freeport bridge is and i said this is really a nice little town
7188232 i rode around town for a while and i said i think ill just move here
7188233 in the big city youre too occupied taking care of your own business
7188234 youre just not taking the time out to do anything small towns like here its a slower pace and i like it here

7188240 kevin 07 as he was nicknamed during the election campaign has changed he said
7188241 in kevin 08 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08 mr turnbull told an appreciative audience of about 250 party members plus state and federal mps
7188242 labor was given an outstanding baton but like weve seen at the olympics theres been no baton that has been so catastrophically dropped as the one john howard gave kevin rudd and the one peter costello gave treasurer wayne swan
7188243 ive decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership particularly about that
7188244 everyone else is commenting on that ill just leave that to others
7188245 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and wayne swan they are the ones who have talked our economy down and talked up inflation
7188246 kevin 07 as he was nicknamed during the election campaign has changed he said
7188247 the administration has received credible inputs that some of the hurriyat leaders faced threat from the vested interests and they could be targeted during the mass rally on monday

7188257 we will sue all who had a hand in murdering our daughter whoever aided those killers and terrorists will have to pay for it
7188258 u s courts consider the rules of evidence without employing any political favoritism
7188259 so if we succeed in proving our claims and i am fairly certain that we will the bank will be ordered to pay the plaintiffs millions of dollars in compensation moreover this will open a door for others who have been victims of terrorist activity which originated in gaza during the relevant time period and they too will be able to demand compensation from the bank of china

7188261 zonder taboes verdwijnt het mysterie en ook de goede seks e n van onze tv zenders vroeg me ooit mee te werken aan een taboedoorbrekende film ik weigerde met de woorden ik zou veel liever enkele taboes opnieuw installeren
7188262 we worden met seks overspoeld en tegelijk krijgen de mensen te weinig of verkeerde informatie te weinig voorlichting over de essentie van de seksualiteit en over het functioneren van onze organen het meest beschreven orgaan van de vrouw is de zogeheten g plek een orgaan dat niet bestaat bij seks is verhulling nodig het mysterie moet gecultiveerd worden
7188263 daardoor kunnen seks fantasie n het limbisch systeem in onze hersenen activeren waarbij via chemische processen de seksuele delen van ons lichaam gestimuleerd worden hoe sterker de suggestie hoe groter de prikkel het verborgene maakt de lust intenser en gemis is de bron van het verlangen
7188264 omgekeerd werkt het tonen van puur instinctieve fysieke seks denk maar aan parenclubs eerder afstotend en weerzinwekkend dan prikkelend
7188265 in sterk toenemende mate maak ik het mee in mijn praktijk de seksuele activiteit neemt snel af het syndroom van de aseksualiteit grijpt om zich heen mannen en vrouwen die alle interesse en lust in seks verloren hebben juist door het wegvallen van de taboes

7188296 it was the worst start of a tournament ever because we were all so close to them
7188297 but everyone knew the way we could have made them happy it was to go out and play the best way we could possibly play
7188298 and that we came as far as we did i hope people watched at home i hope they saw how this is a true team i hope girls back home saw it this is not just any other game its a world thing you know were here to inspire young kids we never stopped fighting

7188342 if thats not good enough its not good enough there hasnt been any mention of if it doesnt go well obviously if you dont play well enough you dont deserve to be on the field
7188343 i take it as what is j t is the starter and im the no 2 im going to continue to prepare and get ready knowing i am one play away im familiar with that obviously having gone through it last year im going to continue to prepare as if i was playing
7188344 this is a new role for me to get to watch another guy play
7188345 theres ups and downs in this game everyone goes through it its a new role for me im going to take it on and make the best of it
7188346 early on maybe a better job of picking up how this offense works i came to work prepared i felt like i put a lot into getting into this playbook and really trying to understand it i dont know if i have any regrets i pushed myself as hard as i could
7188347 not given the way things have gone the last three weeks weve looked good under osullivan and the offense is moving the ball well
7188348 thats neither here nor there the decision was made we just have to move on
7188349 it didnt waver when one gm or one personnel guy or one coach told me i wasnt good enough for that team
7188350 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
7188351 no hemos merecido estar en la crono tres y por eso no hemos entrado
7188352 en la carrera estamos en manos del coche de seguridad podemos decir
7188353 entre el mejor de los intentos en la q1 y los dos que hice en la q2 hubo solo dos d cimas de diferencia por lo tanto el l mite estuvo all
7188354 sab amos que ten amos un gran coche y no tuvimos ning n problema durante la calificaci n
7188355 el equilibrio de mi coche fue bueno y mejoramos continuamente durante las sesiones
7188356 hoy vimos un buen trabajo de lewis y heikki caracterizado por tiempos por vuelta muy fuertes que reflejan sus estrategias
7188357 buen trabajo del equipo despu s de algunas carreras desafortunadas las sensaciones aqu en valencia son buenas
7188358 la octava plaza no es perfecta pero creo que era lo m ximo a lo que pod amos aspirar con la carga de combustible en juego
7188359 sobre este trazado nuevo robert realiz una buena calificaci n de nuevo
7188360 nos ha costado mucho mantener una buena velocidad durante todo el fin de semana
7188361 esperaba poder pasar de la primera parte de la calificaci n
7188362 ha sido una de las mejores clasificaciones hemos logrado colocarnos entre los diez primeros y esto es un buen resultado para nosotros
7188363 es positivo que ambos coches se encuentren cerca de las posiciones medias
7188364 es el mejor resultado hasta ahora en calificaci n y estoy muy satisfecho porque he necesitado poco tiempo para mejorar el s ptimo puesto que consegu durante mi primer gran premio de f rmula 1
7188365 tenemos que tener algo bien hecho pero no s lo que es
7188366 despu s de nuestra complicada sesi n de entrenamientos libres de ayer hab amos cambiado totalmente mis reglajes para hoy
7188367 no s qu fue mal pero no consegu dar una buena vuelta durante la segunda sesi n y eso fue todo
7188368 en total ha sido un d a muy dif cil y el resultado en la calificaci n ha sido decepcionante
7188369 la primera sesi n de esta ma ana fue realmente buena la pista iba mejorando el nivel de adherencia en cada vuelta
7188370 creo que logr exprimir lo m ximo del coche en el mejor momento y al final estamos a 1 3 segundos del mejor tiempo marcado en la q1 esto muestra que cada vez estamos m s cerca creo que hicimos lo m ximo posible un esfuerzo fant stico del equipo ma ana ser una carrera imprevisible
7188371 l gicamente estoy decepcionado con el resultado de la sesi n de calificaci n porque esperaba otra cosa para hoy
7188372 estoy decepcionado con mi calificaci n ya que probablemente podr a haber obtenido un mejor tiempo esta tarde
7188373 estamos muy contentos con la primera posici n de massa hizo un buen trabajo
7188374 fue una pena para kimi que pod a haber estado un poco mas arriba aunque la cuarta posici n no puede ser considerada como mala
7188375 es bueno estar en la pole especialmente despu s de la decepci n de budapest pero s que la carrera es ma ana y todav a queda mucho por venir
7188376 la cuarta posici n no es lo que estaba buscando pero no es el fin del mundo
7188377 ini orang emang kaya bisa bangun rumah sebegini mewah tapi sayang dia enggak punya otak bikin rumah tinggi2 di gang sempit pula ini namanya perampasan pemandangan
7188378 hemos tenido una sesi n de clasificaci n muy decepcionante en particular porque hab amos sido r pidos hasta ahora
7188379 debido a nuestras posiciones de parrilla la carrera ser dif cil para nosotros

7188382 but not all transactions occur at the same time the person providing the service may not need anything in return at that time when they do thats when they pay the 15 percent
7188383 its an interesting and eclectic group of people who need something and the exchange makes everyone an equal
7188384 someone always feels like they didnt get something of equal value for what they did
7188385 we give customers instant credit for their services they can spend the next day and in this economy that can work out better than waiting to get paid also you can barter with anyone in the group the person you did work for might not have what you want but another member will
7188386 the worse the economy gets the more businesses want to barter why pay for something in cash if you can trade for it instead
7188387 people dont join out of the goodness of their hearts people who join need something
7188388 it gives you an opportunity to find clients you normally wouldnt be able to find
7188389 it also gives you opportunities to move inventory you might not be able to move otherwise
7188390 the exchange may not be for everybody but it definitely works for me
7188391 i still have to do a cash business i cant pay employees with barter dollars but im very happy with the exchange all of them
7188392 i want to include companies in this area and be part of the growth sometimes it seems like people arent moving in theyre moving away i grew up in boston and never knew the southcoast existed but once i saw it i loved it

7188407 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
7188408 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
7188409 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand

7188413 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
7188414 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
7188415 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
7188416 we are not staying home with our children by default
7188417 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
7188418 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
7188419 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
7188420 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
7188421 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
7188422 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year

7188431 dahulu pernah mereka memiliki artefak kuno yang pernah dipakai untuk membasmi vidaish para pengisap darah namun semenjak artefak itu hilang mereka mendapatkan masalah besar saat vidaish menjadi tidak bisa dihadapi
7188432 beruntung sekarang sudah tidak ada vidaish yang berkeliaran dengan liar kebanyakan sudah hidup di gua karena jumlah mereka tidak lagi mendominasi tanah nyiesee
7188433 jadi mereka mengincar kekuatan ini untuk memusnahkan vidaish lebih lanjut

7188501 men women all of you gathered here today may i have your attention for a brief moment
7188502 first congratulations are in order to our newcomers melody and kyter without their valiant efforts and expert piloting this day would not have been won
7188503 however the frank fact of the matter is that we are not longer safe here the disinfectors know where we are they know were weaker now the asylum must be abandoned i know many of you know this place as home as a place that took you in when you were hungry and alone but we have no time for nostalgia we are engaged in war we are at war with an enemy that will not stop to hear our pleas an enemy that will not hold a truce an enemy that does not truly understand who we are we are a small group of people not quite human who holds every right to human mercy as do those unaffected our enemy will not yield and the only thing we can do is evade their sight we do not have the force to take them on nor will we any time soon i therefore suggest that you all go your separate ways if you take a ship i urge you to take others with you as many as will fit i am happy to have known all of you and call you my friends but now is a time of action i urge you from the bottom of my heart to go find somewhere to live peacefully raise families become one with the society but never forget this day never forget the day when you raised your voice and shouted to those who would take your life and most importantly never forget those who died in sacrifice for all i leave you now not as your leader but as your friend
7188504 we will be taking the fury to los diablos there are many like us there it may be hard but it is free of the disinfector stain all who would join us meet in the docking bay

7188506 for rescuing me from what would no doubt become a dead end life for showing me something new for

7188518 the year 2008 may enter history as the time when the democratic party lost its way on trade
7188519 economically it should be a no brainer especially at a time of rising u s joblessness
7188520 a reward to a friendly democratic government that has made tremendous strides on human rights despite harassment from venezuelas hugo ch vez

7188523 spit nafta out of their mouths as if the acronym were a synonym for the antichrist
7188524 our families will have to compete with heavily subsidized agricultural products from the united states pushing us toward economic and cultural extinction
7188525 there is no compelling reason to reopen nafta or to think that the united states could do any better on second effort
7188526 are they each unaware of the real statistics on naftas effects
7188527 it is difficult to quantify naftas effect very precisely given the complexities involved in assigning direct causality between naftas implementation and economic shifts

7188529 would like to see some evidence that our government is willing to enforce the labor provisions in any existing
7188530 is important but an agreement to broaden it could take a while the colombia deal is too time sensitive to hold hostage
7188531 remarkable success in quelling civil conflict and restoring order and human rights
7188532 evidence is sparse that all or even most of the union dead were killed because of their labor organizing
7188533 ignores geographic and socioeconomic factors poor rural residents in the countrys war zones bear a disproportionate risk from violence and it is clear that the union officials continue to be specific targets for intimidation and violence
7188534 no fair minded person can fail to note that colombian unionists are far safer today than they used to be
7188535 under a cloud of potentially having supported violence against unions against labor against opposition
7188536 a solid ally and a counterweight to venezuelan strongman hugo ch vez
7188537 closer to hostile leftist rivals such as venezuelan president hugo ch vez
7188538 one of americas few allies in an important region that has become increasingly hostile to the united states interests

7188574 we are going ahead with our indefinite agitation and we are strengthening it further
7188575 we are open to talks with the opposition parties to find out a solution but it is not possible to return the 400 acres meant for setting up ancillary plants
7188576 it is the moral duty of the government to see that all those who have given land for the project are benefited from it
7188577 there is no question of the tata group going away from the state this project will happen here successfully
7188578 the ancillary industries are very important for the project as well as for the state because in the future it will invite many more investments in the state
7188579 we want a peaceful agitation but if something goes out of gear its the state governments responsibility if they indulge in any violence we have the right to protect ourselves too
7188580 we are making 21 camps around the factory site for this indefinite agitation

7188617 im excited by all the mainstream offers but im not giving up the adult entertainment industry at least yet
7188618 yes it does exist yes it was me but it was never meant for public viewing
7188619 it was done in private for private enjoyment however since all the controversy its got me interested in the adult business which is why im here tonight i support the industry and although i wont act in one of these things i will direct some x rated product ill leave the on screen acting to the professionals

7188629 ive seen an uptick in discrimination cases im a defense lawyer and ive got more work coming in
7188630 when the economy takes a downturn its harder to find a new job quickly and complaints tend to rise
7188631 ive seen more complaints of age discrimination and medical leave issues especially
7188632 people with high benefit costs may have a target on their back these days employers are either getting bolder or perhaps more desperate in bleaker times
7188633 when employers do reductions in work force a lot of them use severance payments and get releases
7188634 i would like to stand up for my rights because im right in this situation
7188635 the plaintiff is being killed not by a gun but by a very smart and slow way which makes him more suffering
7188636 the plaintiff is coming to the court to protect himself his family and his career
7188637 youve probably got a better chance of being hit by lightning and winning the lottery
7188638 the reality is that employment law is anti cyclical if times are bad its good for us
7188639 when times are good you can go get another job and it doesnt matter that much if you were treated unfairly
7188640 if you have an accident and cleanup costs and the decommissioning fund isnt full who pays for it
7188641 it could be the taxpayers as well as the ratepayers
7188642 when i was growing up the only basketball coaching we had was at the park
7188643 but there is only so far that you can go with that its just really hard without proper training
7188644 i had just had my son and i felt so bad
7188645 my father before me was in prison and i remembered how it felt but i still followed my father into the same position i dont want to go into the sob story but i didnt get a college degree to go into selling drugs my faith in myself had been shaken so badly
7188646 he showed me the vest and when i saw it in action i fell in love with all of the different things that it can do
7188647 he has to know his target market and target that market i think it works like an annuity program each year there are kids who are growing up to be between the ages of 8 to 14 and then when they get older and stronger they can increase the resistance
7188648 i think once they see the product and how it works they will be sold
7188649 it is exactly what we as coaches are looking for
7188650 whats driving it is the recognition that information is becoming more and more valuable theres an economic advantage to having better information
7188651 its pretty much an extension of what at amp t carries on land
7188652 we can do pretty much anything you can do with an at amp t phone on land
7188653 when you talk about a cell site on land youre talking about millions of customers
7188654 out here youre talking about maybe thousands so the economies of scale are different
7188655 it used to be a 10 minute limit on the phone
7188656 theres been just a continual demand for bandwidth for applications
7188657 you can put him in an office and bring all that information into his office and onto his computer screen

7188659 we believe land should be owned by new zealand citizens and residents only and our laws should be changed to say that
7188660 why should we allow singaporean australian or american speculators to buy investment properties in our country shutting first time home buyers from the market
7188661 overall were pretty pleased with the changes that have been made
7188662 if a product doesnt fit neatly into one of those definitions im not sure a company will be willing to offer it
7188663 if fewer companies offer fixed price plans where does that leave customers with just variable rate or indexed plans
7188664 its a little troubling because were always advertising the power to choose site as a way to compare plans but letting some of them decide not to make their information available
7188665 id be more than a little reluctant to sign up with someone who made it hard for me to find out information about details of their plans but apparently some people dont have a problem with that

7188670 everyone else is commenting on that ill just leave that to others
7188671 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and wayne swan they are the ones who have talked our economy down and talked up inflation

7188696 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7188697 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7188698 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7188699 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7188700 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7188701 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7188702 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7188703 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7188704 the beijing olympics are another milepost in chinas transformation into an efficient market oriented and financially sophisticated economy and a more open society

7188715 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
7188716 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
7188717 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
7188718 i dont see how they came up with their numbers
7188719 once closings started to happen we started to see more activity
7188720 it was far brisker than any other pace we had seen
7188721 it never held us up but it slowed things down
7188722 if not for all the financial crisis and delays we would have sold the building out already
7188723 we didnt find that we were losing buyers to other developments we were losing them because they couldnt close

7188730 the whole team walked together side by side to win this game captain feng kun said
7188731 he was too strict said his coach leudis gonzalez referring to the decision to disqualify matos afterward he charged the match was fixed accusing the kazakhs of offering the referee money
7188732 lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7188733 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted

7188754 i bought a two letter dot com from some guy on the internet after wiring him the money he never transferred the domain i cant prove that he even owned the domain since it has a private domain registration any suggestions
7188755 my domain registrar is a crook its true that a huge number of fortune 500 corporations trust them with their intellectual property but i cant believe that they have the audacity to charge more than 1 what it costs them to process domains through the registry sure they deserve to make a profit but 50 cents per domain per year should be plenty to operate their servers and pay expenses

7188784 i dont think people realize what it is to not make a team and then to try to make the next team the real willpower that it takes to hang onto that dream
7188785 i think you have to ask a lot of questions how important is it what kind of financial support are you going to have an olympic medal yeah its going to help you get ahead in life but its not going to secure the rest of your life
7188786 one of the three fields had an 83 percent hunter success rate with some harvesting 5 birds or more hunter density was high at guadalupe county leases
7188787 its been hard fought to get all of these medals to come out and play against australia is kind of like how the story had to go
7188788 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determinate guidelines for law enforcement
7188789 ive never experienced a member of congress who is pushing me to come up with more things he can do to advance human rights
7188790 they lead to the big cases and they lead to legislation very often
7188791 i bet you dont have a plug in that gun do you
7188792 ive been tested after every final session and a few preliminary sessions ive been doing since i got here and in singapore and at the training camp in palo alto calif
7188793 from the trials to now id say by a rough estimate theres been 40 tests thats a bunch but its part of the game and good for the sport to have it
7188794 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count we know were good we know were clean we work hard and any time you want to test us its ok
7188795 i did project believe with usada where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts and i have the results to prove it
7188796 i want to be absolutely clear we cant guarantee their cleanliness
7188797 my medal count goal is that at the end of the day when 91 000 people leave that stadium theyve heard our national anthem so many times that theyre humming it when they walk out the door
7188798 we came out with a new attitude tonight men and women
7188799 its just special its a group effort and its totally different from an individual thing its a blessing to end on this note
7188800 its hard after working for four years and coming up short i dont think that memory will go away overnight i think about it a lot but at least now i have something positive to think about as well
7188801 we had a meeting this afternoon we didnt talk about what people thought we talked about things that were going on in america we talked about people sitting around their tv watching we wanted to give them a shot of something so they would really get up in the morning and keep it going
7188802 i think they understood the importance of the moment to represent
7188803 we had confidence in sanya that she would be able to bring it home strong
7188804 when i saw the russian team ahead of us i was like finally i have a chance to chase and really have fun it really pumped me up to have a little challenge was exciting
7188805 shes one of the best competitors and i guess she was kind of mad at the bronze medal so she was ready to go
7188806 its an incredible team probably the strongest team that weve ever sent to the olympics
7188807 i am not proud that we werent in the finals i have lived my entire life to be in that race we werent there i cant change that but it shouldnt have a reflection on how this mens team performed
7188808 somebody somewhere has got a voodoo doll of the u s
7188809 these are professional athletes who are the best in their field and anybody who ever ran a high school relay cringes when that baton hits the track
7188810 it reminds me of nba players who have horrendous free throw percentages all it takes is repetition preparation and focus to make a free throw the same goes for baton passing
7188811 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7188812 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7188813 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7188814 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7188815 macska f lt kenys g s l ngol szerelem a t bbit l sd cic n l
7188816 i want my apartment i want to go to school i want transportation
7188817 i want these things and im capable of getting them
7188818 the day i got my passport felt like a birthday
7188819 it will be over and then who is tad after that i think hes wrestling with that
7188820 they asked me if id like to come to one of their games
7188821 i know its not a date but that made me feel good
7188822 theyre not all roy williams and ricky williams not everybody is casey hampton and shaun rogers everybody thinks weve got 44 of them weve got really good players who play hard and we have to put them in the right places and feature what they do best
7188823 but we dont have as many great players as people think we do
7188824 weve just got to dissect everything figure out whats going on go to work thats the only thing you can do
7188825 we were mad about different things in 2007 that were going on it still bothers me weve got to go out there and sign our name to something make a statement early on set our reputation for the year
7188826 they havent even had a test yet theyre still studying
7188827 its like theyve got their tutors their coach and theyre building up to it but now its time to play and put it out there and find out who we are
7188828 everybody talks about who they are in preseason nobody really knows unless youve got 20 starters back from last year or something and you still dont know how theyre going to react but you at least have seen them before
7188829 hopefully because of colt coming back well have a little bit of a handle in terms of what well be able to do
7188830 its always at the back of your mind especially as someone who owns a business you wonder whether to keep building and reinvesting
7188831 but it just sits there behind you it doesnt stop you doing anything
7188832 as far as israeli law is concerned it is a part of israel like tel aviv or haifa so why are we even talking about considering giving it back
7188833 we are living here and we believe we will continue to live here and make wine here
7188834 its a tragedy there because there are two nations in one place
7188835 here it was different we never did something wrong to the arabs because when we came here it was empty
7188836 when we started we were pioneers we came here with the governments blessing
7188837 to continue your life here as a normal human being you must decide its business as usual otherwise you leave
7188838 well be angry well be against it but we wont shoot at the israeli army we are not gaza or hebron
7188839 we can live in a smaller israel the real problem is that arabs cant live with israelis they dont want to for them we are always strangers like the crusaders
7188840 about 70 percent say they are not willing to exchange the golan for a real peace treaty so we have good support
7188841 technical arrangements are important but not the heart of the matter water demilitarisation open access all these can be fixed in negotiations im speaking about our basic rights here after 40 years this should be on the table
7188842 some people say its ours its biblical its annexed others say the same holiness exists for peace i say find a middle way if not its not a necessity were here to stay
7188843 if there is real peace well welcome syrian riders to ramot ranch

7188867 the game is in 11 days after today we have 11 days to get better 11 days to get healthy hopefully he can get healthy in 11 days
7188868 it just seemed like he turned the corner and kind of took an awkward step
7188869 the turf is hard and playing at the speed and trying to turn that edge its easy to tweak something
7188870 we know we have the personnel to step up in his absence
7188871 obviously hes a pro bowler you cant replace someone like that without feeling it at least a little bit but we understand we do have enough people here to get the job done
7188872 thats the great thing about this team is i feel like they have some faith in me
7188873 those guys i go out there and its just like im in lets go osi he missed a couple of practices during training camp so theyre comfortable with me

7188878 your thought processes are like that of an alien with shit instead of a brain
7188879 from the starting point i think of the way to win the gold
7188880 i dont think about the time from that point i push it push it push it
7188881 i remembered all the guys who would love to be in my shoes right now
7188882 it was the worst start of a tournament ever because we were all so close to them
7188883 but everyone knew the way we could have made them happy it was to go out and play the best way we could possibly play
7188884 and that we came as far as we did i hope people watched at home i hope they saw how this is a true team i hope girls back home saw it this is not just any other game its a world thing you know were here to inspire young kids we never stopped fighting
7188885 were in touch with her by e mail joines said
7188886 we read hers and she reads ours she says it brings a smile to her face when she does
7188887 i play better i just kind of go on my emotions
7188888 the usa team is the best weve seen in the last four years
7188889 but weve got to think about what we really did we accomplished a lot
7188890 i guess she was pretty mad about getting the bronze she said
7188891 i knew if i just kept at it kept pushing potentially i could catch her she said
7188892 i trained for four years and came up short she said
7188893 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive richards said afterward
7188894 i feel so betrayed by my body once again and its just such a tough break for me i feel like i worked so hard in vain
7188895 i think this kind of sportsmanship and brotherhood is really remarkable
7188896 what touched me most was the attitude of this american shooter
7188897 i saw them hugging together and that was a nice moment
7188898 again leading and being very close to gold he took his rifle put his hand on the trigger and for some reason the trigger went off
7188899 this is a big failure i take responsibility but i will come back and i will win gold
7188900 this is the true spirit of the olympic games the games is not only about winning not only about being triumphant it is about the struggle of every athlete every day to achieve his or her own limits and having this resilience
7188901 im confident that we can protect children here and that is my top priority the protection of children not of offenders
7188902 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival here
7188903 there has been no opportunity to put forward why he was innocent of those crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
7188904 he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
7188905 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country

7188912 it doesnt get old its still an amazing feat to put together an 800
7188913 i was in a junior tournament and nervous was an understatement
7188914 its kind of like shooting the winning basket or hitting the game winning home run all eyes are on you
7188915 we have a lot of juniors coming up who need good coaching
7188916 and to me bowling is about family and friends and making a difference
7188917 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7188918 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7188919 did any of you know each other well as friends or schoolmates before coming together as a band

7188957 es el comandante quien decide si se baja a los pasajeros
7188958 vincular los problemas de rentabilidad de la compa a al accidente es faltar al respeto a las v ctimas
7188959 es muy f cil culpar de todo al comandante que est muerto y as no tener que dar explicaciones de por qu se autoriz el despegue de un avi n que estaba averiado

7188965 el nico capaz de llegar a acuerdos con nacionalistas y no nacionalistas
7188966 nosotros estamos dispuestos a hablar negociar y pacta unos presupuestos porque eso obliga a un gobierno a utilizar los recursos para gestionar en favor de los ciudadanos si a trav s de una negociaci n podemos orientar la gesti n hacia las necesidades de la sociedad perfecto

7188968 la desastrosa pol tica exterior de los a os de bush y mccain
7188969 l der que cambie la direcci n de am rica y del mundo
7188970 nunca podremos saberlo ya pero la pregunta surge por s sola podr a haberse evitado el terrible accidente de barajas si el ejecutivo de haber cumplido con los plazos que l mismo se marc hubiera implantado una nueva inspecci n m s eficaz
7188971 fomento argumentaba a principios de a o que pretend a implantar un modelo de control de seguridad a rea semejante al brit nico uno de los mejores de europa la realidad es que seis meses despu s todo sigue igual que entonces pero con el drama a adido de 154 personas fallecidas el gobierno tiene que dar una explicaci n a todos los ciudadanos
7188972 que las investigaciones t cnicas tardar n a n en determinar con rigor las causas de lo ocurrido es un argumento que los familiares comprenden y asumen en su inmenso dolor sin embargo conocer qu es el calentador de la sonda de temperatura exterior del avi n o el n mero de revisiones o la cualificaci n y experiencia del t cnico que examin el aparato son preguntas de f cil respuesta que spanair no ha dado hasta ahora y que los afectados ten an derecho a conocer desde el primer momento en adelante la transparencia ha de ser la norma as lo exige la memoria de los fallecidos
7188973 la crisis y en particular el incremento del desempleo suscitan interrogantes acerca de la inmigraci n que no se hab an considerado es preciso que el estado refuerce el seguimiento de c mo est afectando a los trabajadores extranjeros que afine el an lisis de la nueva situaci n sobre este colectivo para poder as adoptar medidas que anticipen previni ndolas cualquier deriva pol tica indeseable
7188974 obama ha dado un viraje demasiado oportunista hacia el centro en las ltimas semanas para calmar las sospechas de quienes le acusan de ser un izquierdista cuando en realidad no es m s que un reformista pragm tico que se acomoda inteligentemente a las circunstancias en cualquier caso resulta incre ble que mccain siga no s lo vivo sino fuerte viniendo de un partido muy da ado por los ocho a os de presidencia de bush y con la econom a sin s ntomas de recuperaci n
7188975 sin duda habr decepcionado a quienes esperaban que se decantara por alguien con mayor carisma y m s alejado del sistema pero obama ha preferido jugar sobre seguro y al mismo tiempo reconoce con esta elecci n que sus flancos d biles son la pol tica exterior y la seguridad la llamada clase media blanca que vot masivamente en las primarias a hillary clinton y a la falta de experiencia en puestos ejecutivos
7188976 importa cubrir los flancos profesionales ideol gicos o electorales m s vulnerables es lo que ha hecho barack obama
7188977 pero pese al s lido bagaje de biden m s de treinta a os en el senado siguen sin garantizar una experiencia real de gobierno s lo el tiempo aclarar la influencia de esta elecci n en la campa a de obama pero el ticket dem crata con mccain subiendo ahora en las encuestas habr alegrado a m s de un republicano
7188978 la otan ya ha tomado la decisi n estrat gica de preparase para una guerra prolongada y muy probablemente afganist n ser objeto de debate en la campa a electoral norteamericana por lo que es fundamental preservar el apoyo social a la guerra a pesar de los lamentables errores que se han cometido durante los bombardeos en los que lamentablemente se producen bajas civiles naturalmente tambi n es necesario exigir al gobierno afgano del presidente hamid karzai que cumpla con sus obligaciones se esfuerce m s por instaurar estructuras sanas administrativas y seguridad en el pa s para hacer que el sacrificio de la otan tenga sentido tambi n para los afganos
7188979 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7188980 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7188981 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7188982 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7188983 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7188984 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7188985 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7188986 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7188987 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7188988 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7188989 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7188990 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7188991 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7188992 democrats have not been this excited at a convention since 1992 when they nominated bill clinton
7188993 it energized our party weve now got a chance to win indiana all obama has to do is carry the same states that sen john kerry carried in 2004 and win illinois indiana and west virginia and he is the president
7188994 we will sit with the indiana delegation and see history made as the first african american is nominated for president
7188995 they will put her name on the ballot so the question is do we actually vote for her if it goes to a vote i vote for her what i imagine will happen is they will run the ballot up to new york and when it is time for her to vote she will withdraw her name and ask all of her delegates to go for barack obama
7188996 it is a foregone conclusion obama has the number of delegates to win
7188997 i was not a slated delegate i had to campaign for it
7188998 i see the convention as bringing everything to fruition letting the first viable female candidate be nominated from the floor on the first ballot letting her delegates vote for her which brings it all to a complete closure it is a great way to unite the party
7188999 i want to be out there educating myself to see how i can be more effective in making my candidate become elected
7189000 this economy has hit my family very hard there has to be a change
7189001 i anticipate shell release her delegates and ask them to back obama so it looks like a unified party
7189002 are at opposite ends of the political spectrum on a number of issues
7189003 it could change the social fabric of america on important social issues
7189004 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7189005 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7189006 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7189007 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7189008 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7189009 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7189010 we are broken up im happy about that ive wanted it for a long time and im not going to deny that
7189011 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7189012 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7189013 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7189014 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7189015 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7189016 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7189017 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7189018 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7189019 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7189020 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7189021 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7189022 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7189023 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7189024 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7189025 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7189026 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7189027 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7189028 k ga ook naar mn bedje word wel tijd h en kzal je die leuke idee n weleens doormailen als jij dr dan ook wat mee doet haha grappie
7189029 look by the way give up the one thing that keeps us from attacking you and after that were going to attack you were going to take you down
7189030 i want the iranians to know that if im the president we will attack iran
7189031 in the next 10 years during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on israel we would be able to totally obliterate them
7189032 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7189033 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7189034 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7189035 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7189036 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7189037 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7189038 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7189039 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7189040 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7189041 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7189042 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7189043 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7189044 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7189045 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7189046 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7189047 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7189048 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7189049 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7189050 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7189051 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7189052 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7189053 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7189054 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7189055 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7189056 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7189057 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7189058 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7189059 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7189060 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7189061 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7189062 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7189063 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7189064 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7189065 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7189066 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7189067 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7189068 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7189069 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7189070 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7189071 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7189072 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7189073 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7189074 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7189075 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7189076 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7189077 vancomycin has traditionally been reserved as a drug of last resort used only after treatment with other antibiotics had failed
7189078 im afraid we are just postponing the inevitable we are going to loose this new graft
7189079 what is hope nothing but the paint on the face of existence
7189080 consciousness is the phenomenon whereby the universes very existence is made known
7189081 sometimes the only available transportation is a leap of faith
7189082 at the edge of the city on the brink of the unknown
7189083 dare to claim the promise that was spoken at the start
7189084 may your heart head for the sky with wings of soul full flight
7189085 may your dreams paint the dawn with all the colors of your light
7189086 as you seek and discover all the worlds precious wonder
7189087 may you always know the power of your own true colors
7189088 ik heb geleerd dat je n it het lot moet tarten
7189089 als dat alles is wat tegen al dat geluk moet opwegen dan ben ik er nog goed vanaf gekomen
7189090 ja hallo jij wordt wel vaak aangenomen de laatste tijd
7189091 i was in your arms thinking i belonged there i figured it made sense building me a fence building me a home thinking id be strong there but i was a fool playing by the rules
7189092 but tell me does she kiss like i used to kiss you does it feel the same when she calls your name somewhere deep inside you must know i miss you but what can i say rules must be obeyed
7189093 are you reading this for fun or for a class
7189094 carsten i have to go back to london on saturday for two weeks would you like to watch my place
7189095 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7189096 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7189097 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7189098 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7189099 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7189100 member me in san clemente where we doodled well actually 14 doodled
7189101 if you will serve the lord with all your heart then you can a beautiful person that you ever wanted because it is jesus whom they see in you
7189102 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7189103 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7189104 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7189105 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7189106 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7189107 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7189108 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7189109 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7189110 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7189111 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7189112 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7189113 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7189114 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7189115 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7189116 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7189117 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7189118 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7189119 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7189120 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7189121 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7189122 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7189123 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7189124 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7189125 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7189126 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7189127 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7189128 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7189129 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7189130 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7189131 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7189132 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7189133 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7189134 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7189135 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7189136 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7189137 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7189138 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7189139 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7189140 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7189141 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7189142 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7189143 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7189144 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7189145 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7189146 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7189147 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7189148 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7189149 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7189150 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7189151 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7189152 the penang state government has been mulling over the decision ever since the elections commission fixed a working day on tuesday august 26 as polling day in defiance of public opinion that this will reduce the voter turnout
7189153 by fixing polling day on a working day and giving such preferential treatment of a special school holiday the education ministry is trying to gain an advantage for a certain party and their candidate
7189154 to ensure a level playing field and fairness to all candidates the penang state government has decided to declare august 26 2008 as a state public holiday
7189155 the state government requests all factories to assist their workers in permatang pauh to carry out their duties to determine not only their choice of wakil rakyat but also decide the destiny of the country
7189156 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7189157 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7189158 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7189159 we are seeking to confirm media reports that an australian has allegedly been kidnapped near mogadishu in somalia
7189160 of widespread armed conflict very high threat of terrorist attack against western interests and advises australians against travel to somalia
7189161 westerners have been targeted and killed in terrorist attacks throughout somalia including mogadishu foreigners including australians have been kidnapped
7189162 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7189163 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7189164 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7189165 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7189166 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7189167 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7189168 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7189169 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7189170 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7189171 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7189172 kevin 07 as he was nicknamed during the election campaign has changed he said
7189173 in kevin 08 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08 mr turnbull told an appreciative audience of about 250 party members plus state and federal mps
7189174 labor was given an outstanding baton but like weve seen at the olympics theres been no baton that has been so catastrophically dropped as the one john howard gave kevin rudd and the one peter costello gave treasurer wayne swan
7189175 ive decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership particularly about that
7189176 everyone else is commenting on that ill just leave that to others
7189177 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and wayne swan they are the ones who have talked our economy down and talked up inflation
7189178 kevin 07 amp squo amp squo as he was nicknamed during the election campaign has changed he said
7189179 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7189180 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7189181 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7189182 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7189183 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7189184 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7189185 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7189186 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7189187 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7189188 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7189189 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7189190 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7189191 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7189192 kevin 07 as he was nicknamed during the election campaign has changed he said
7189193 in kevin 08 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08 mr turnbull told an appreciative audience of about 250 party members plus state and federal mps
7189194 labor was given an outstanding baton but like weve seen at the olympics theres been no baton that has been so catastrophically dropped as the one john howard gave kevin rudd and the one peter costello gave treasurer wayne swan
7189195 ive decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership particularly about that
7189196 everyone else is commenting on that ill just leave that to others
7189197 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and wayne swan they are the ones who have talked our economy down and talked up inflation
7189198 kevin 07 as he was nicknamed during the election campaign has changed he said
7189199 i would like to thank all those who have offered their love and support
7189200 my main concern at the moment is the welfare of our family
7189201 i will be making no further comment at this time and would request that the privacy of our family is respected
7189202 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7189203 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7189204 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7189205 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7189206 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7189207 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7189208 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7189209 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7189210 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7189211 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7189212 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7189213 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7189214 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7189215 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7189216 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7189217 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7189218 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7189219 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7189220 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7189221 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7189222 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7189223 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7189224 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7189225 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7189226 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7189227 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7189228 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7189229 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7189230 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7189231 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7189232 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7189233 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7189234 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7189235 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7189236 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7189237 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7189238 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7189239 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7189240 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7189241 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7189242 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7189243 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7189244 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7189245 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7189246 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7189247 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7189248 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7189249 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7189250 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature

7189252 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7189253 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies

7189262 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7189263 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7189264 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

7189268 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7189269 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners

7189367 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7189368 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7189369 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7189370 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7189371 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and
7189372 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance

7189388 they have worked so hard in turning the program around
7189389 now i feel it is the coaches job to keep the program running if we make it fun for the kids i hope we will continue to keep the numbers

7189426 the rabbit logo has to be the most recognizable of any in the world this is our 1 million salute 30ft high and just over 2 stories on the 24th and 25th floors so it can be seen from the strip the i 15 and up to a mile away its an electronic led so we can have any color and any image we want on it we selected video from the early days of playboy for the inside screen to make it very special and unique we have resurrected the brand for the 21st century and i believe everybody will accept it and embrace it because the tv show has helped tremendously and a whole new generationhas become fascinated with the playboy image that christy has reborn in a new direction plus we have the most gorgeous girls in the world in their new roberto cavalli uniforms complete with trademark fluffy rabbit tails and ears as our playboy dealers and cocktail servers and when i gave him the tour of his very own sky villa he stopped took a moment and said this is a very special time for me he was in tears absolutely blown away by what he saw
7189427 to recreate the classic cache of the playboy clubs in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation is a dream come true when people see these venues they will be blown away this is the coolest party in town i was the person who had the sad task of closing the very last club 20 years ago and now im the happiest person re opening a brand new one its a euphoric feeling today though we are very different from the past its very important to remember we are not a standalone nightclub here but an integrated entertainment experience with dancing in moon drinking and dining in nove and entertainment and gaming in the playboy club so people will experience the brand in 3 different kinds of ways its the next generation of what a nightclub should be no nightclubs were ever more successful than playboy clubs for the number of years they were open they had the best entertainment the coolest guests and the greatest food all those years ago today though its impossible to book entertainment in such small clubs so thats why gaming became the important element what weve all done here in vegas will now be duplicated in london macau where the brand can come back to life in the same multi dimensional way this is the perfect town with the perfect partners and a family tradition continues
7189428 it is everything we wanted we kept asking hef if he was happy with what hesaw he said it was even more than we had promised he had tears in his eyes saying he was blown away and he just kept on hugging us we wanted to deliver more than beyond his wildest imagination we wanted his validation and he said we did it this is the first time ever that gaming and lounging have been integrated we wanted luxury and exclusivity without snobbery and this just smells of money
7189429 we are very happy with the girls we found as dealers and servers to represent playboy vegas
7189430 i agree that las vegas has always been considered los angeless playground and in reality the playboy mansion has always been considered a playground for the well to do and the important people in la so i think this will be the same just a little further east

7189445 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7189446 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7189447 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7189448 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7189449 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7189450 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7189451 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7189452 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7189453 all we pretty much had to do is run we didnt have to make many cuts
7189454 if youre going to take a whipping like this get it out of way now and come back and respond
7189455 i had a little bit more confidence tonight and especially when one of your first runs is a big run it builds confidence
7189456 but i think what you saw was the explosiveness of both backs
7189457 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
7189458 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
7189459 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
7189460 nortels solution is helping necu overcome the challenges of one to one communication in an organisation that is spread across multiple branches some in remote rural areas
7189461 this unified communications approach will help necu stand out from the crowd as people look for different ways of collaborating with each other and their service organisations using multiple web enabled devices in todays era of hyperconnectivity when anything that can be connected to the network is being connected
7189462 the operational savings weve calculated as a result of implementing this technology are substantial delivering significant customer service enhancement more efficiently will have lasting benefits on both our top and bottom line this gives us an incredibly powerful platform for connecting our people with our customers in a variety of different ways through audio video text and im and ensures that regardless of where our customers are located we have the resources available to serve them
7189463 20 of a contact center agents time was spent looking for the right person who was also available to assist
7189464 carragher was amazing because normally he isnt a great finisher after that gerrard showed his quality too even though he isnt 100 per cent fit he can change games
7189465 the team showed its winning mentality this is the kind of determination we want to see for the rest of the season
7189466 last season we were drawing or losing these kind of games at home so it was important that we won it sends a positive message to the fans who were maybe thinking about last season
7189467 when you are kicking towards that kop end you can feel them helping you and helping the team it was a great feeling this is what we play the game for the roof came off the place at the end
7189468 the fans were patient with us even though things didnt always go how we wanted middlesbrough played well and maybe deserved something from the game but we showed character and kept going until the end
7189469 we have been working on having a positive mentality and trying to kill off the lesser teams and we finally got the breakthrough thanks to jamie carragher
7189470 we wanted to capture the character and spirit of a pub session which is the natural home of our music
7189471 we came up with the idea of a regular radio show with guests jamming with the band to send to america i must say ive never seen the band so excited about a project
7189472 the members of dervish will make up the programs house band
7189473 het was een kwestie van de juiste plaats en het juiste ogenblik
7189474 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7189475 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7189476 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7189477 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7189478 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7189479 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7189480 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7189481 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7189482 les jeux olympiques ne peuvent r gler tous les maux du monde
7189483 le cio et les jeux olympiques ne peuvent imposer des changements des nations souveraines ou r gler tous les maux du monde
7189484 mais nous pouvons et nous le faisons contribuer un changement positif par le sport
7189485 nous sommes avant tout une organisation consacr e au sport
7189486 nous sommes dabord et avant tout une organisation consacr e au sport mais le sport a un but sest d fendu jacques rogge le monde a appris davantage sur la chine et la chine a appris davantage sur le reste du monde et ensemble nous avons partag lexcitation des jeux
7189487 il y a des choses que londres ne peut copier ou galer mais jai bon espoir que londres pourra placer la barre encore plus haut
7189488 le cio et les jeux olympiques ne peuvent imposer des changements des nations souveraines ou r gler tous les maux du monde
7189489 les jeux olympiques ne peuvent r gler tous les maux du monde
7189490 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7189491 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7189492 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7189493 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7189494 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7189495 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7189496 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7189497 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7189498 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7189499 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7189500 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7189501 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7189502 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7189503 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7189504 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7189505 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7189506 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7189507 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7189508 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7189509 yo recibo a todo el mundo y este caso era m s delicado porque estaba de por medio el nombre del presidente
7189510 lo conoc cuando hice parte de la comisi n de conciliaci n de la iglesia no conoc a al abogado mi participaci n fue m nima en la reuni n si ellos cuentan lo que sucedi dir n que dije lo mismo digan la verdad som tanse a la ley colaboren con la justicia
7189511 al parecer hablan de m no s en qu t rminos a zapata en alg n momento se le indic a qu oficina acudir para sus proyectos productivos uno de ellos de palma africana
7189512 ocasionalmente suministr datos sobre hechos y personas que pod an ser relevantes como una reuni n entre concejales de barranca y ernesto b ez antes de elecciones del 2002 que fue corroborada por algunos de sus asistentes
7189513 porque no ten a ese papel ni ten a por qu asumirlo
7189514 te comento que la idea de hacerte venir hoy es para charlar a mi cliente yo le trasmit nuestra reuni n pasada y le coment de la situaci n y l dijo bueno interesante la propuesta pero l quisiera saber como bien en concreto qu beneficios obtendr a por hacer esto si en su momento lo decide eso es lo primero y lo segundo l dice bueno no es que desconf e del doctor eso de una intermediaci n es como complicado por qu no trata de reunirse directamente con los magistrados que est n directamente interesados en el asunto y los escucha de viva voz y ya teniendo la certeza
7189515 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7189516 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7189517 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7189518 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7189519 its going to be a real tough couple of weeks
7189520 i think we are going to have to lift it up a peg the next couple of weeks and really get it going
7189521 i think weve still got to lift a bit more
7189522 we are on a bit of a roll the enthusiasm is there and the excitement is there when you are winning
7189523 we are still not at our best but we are doing enough to win games
7189524 with the dragons next week weve had a couple of close games with them already in the last couple of years so we are expecting another tight one
7189525 we know weve got work to do and we spoke after the game about the fact that the standards and the stakes increase again next week
7189526 i think its a matter of how we finish the year where we can put ourselves and take it from there
7189527 i dont think we are thinking too far down the track we know the next fortnight will determine if we get there and where we finish
7189528 once that is sorted out we can reassess after that
7189529 they can score a lot of points and theyve got a lot of ball runners in their side and brett finch is obviously an origin halfback theyve got him steering them around
7189530 we are certainly playing a lot more for each other a lot more unselfish play and people working off the footy for other people and our goal line defence has improved out of sight
7189531 se till att kunskapen om banden h lls inom en s sn v krets som m jligt
7189532 vad har jag f r val hur kan jag protestera mot demokraternas och republikanernas politiska monopol jo genom att vara oberoende
7189533 any such talk of secession is preposterous and in conflict with constitution and law of the land
7189534 the countrys borders cannot be altered or redrawn and constitution cannot be rewritten
7189535 those with separatist agenda cannot claim to be representatives of people those who have never contested elections cant claim to represent people
7189536 supporting communal polarisation which is hurtful to the national interest
7189537 our exports are not just double of what they were four years ago but two and a half times of that the average cumulative annual growth rate cagr at 23 per cent was way ahead of the average growth rate in international trade
7189538 our commercial engagement with the world was about 525 billion which is equivalent to 50 per cent of our gdp
7189539 in practical terms this means a four fold increase in our percentage share in the next 12 years considering that the world trade is itself increasing this would translate into an eight fold increase in absolute terms
7189540 there are inputs that they separatist leaders could be targeted so as a precautionary measure curfew has been imposed and people have been asked to maintain peace and calm
7189541 the trp rating system is the single point of degeneration for news telecast in the country and why does the rating system not represent households in bihar or orissa why just only selected households in delhi and mumbai considered
7189542 tracking global cues the stock market is likely to be bullish as no major policy decision is expected this week and with nasdaq and dow jones industrial index hovering in the positive zone the sentiments in the domestic market would remain positive
7189543 the market will remain volatile and witness a strong opening on monday then it will take cues from the crude price movement
7189544 the first individual gold for india in the history of olympics is a historic breakthrough and augurs well for the countrys future
7189545 i consider bindras gold medal as important as that of xu
7189546 i am sure other indian athletes will get inspired by bindras success in beijing and will try to emulate him
7189547 a key breakthrough for the worlds second most populous nation
7189548 you cant change america and give our workers a fighting chance when after 3 million manufacturing jobs disappear you continue to support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7189549 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare that no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7189550 we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
7189551 the next us president is going to deliver the most significant moment in american history since franklin roosevelt he will have such an incredible opportunity not only to change the direction of america but literally to change the direction of the world
7189552 i hope people enjoy the games forget the past and move on
7189553 you have to move forward after the disaster and also the olympics will ask people to move forward
7189554 now we are focusing on linking the region to south east asia on the basic assumption that south east asia begins in north east india
7189555 thats why i have been urging northeastern states to agitate much more with the central government to argue their case before us to factor in the importance of developing ne and determine what our strategy should be for development of the region
7189556 as of now we have decided to go ahead with mondays march to lal chowk
7189557 this is uncalled for despite having a peaceful march people as well as leaders are being picked up
7189558 we are targeting to increase 10 000 hectare under cocoa production every year however this year the acreage is going to increase by 15 000 hectares
7189559 we will be signing the shareholders agreement within three months and expect all regulatory formalities to be completed by this year end
7189560 with legal enforcement becoming more effective and revival opportunities stronger we scent an immense potential in this segment
7189561 we are currently working on the shareholders agreement the idea is to launch the business by january
7189562 as of now we will have 51 per cent stake in the jv it may even go up
7189563 practical innovation has always been the priority area of the party this award vindicates bjps policy of keeping pace with technology for the benefit of party workers and also for the greater interest of the society we serve
7189564 bjp as an organisation was always ahead of its competitors in the use of it in 1996 it became the first political party in india to have its own website the partys automation journey has now been institutionalised by party leadership
7189565 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7189566 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7189567 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7189568 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7189569 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7189570 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7189571 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7189572 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7189573 the internet is the sexy new technology out there but it isnt where most of their money is coming from
7189574 its coming from the mom and pop stores that want to be in that yellow pages book
7189575 today i am a free man i am longer a slave i am among men who are the same colour as me who consider me as a man i earn 1 000 cfa 2 1 a day and that covers my needs
7189576 i decided i would have to go and get him so i hatched a plan i told my master that i needed to take ahmed to his grandparents
7189577 i said we would both return the next day but we never went back
7189578 the situation has not changed with the arrival of democracy
7189579 for example i have an encampment and many people have come to live with us seeking refuge from war and famine
7189580 they help us with rearing the animals and general work
7189581 but this is not slavery like you would find in the koran
7189582 the bella people are free to leave their masters if they wish
7189583 if people came out to declare openly that they are slaves then of course the state would do something
7189584 slavery is taboo no one wants to talk about it
7189585 particularly at the level of the authorities they will not accept that it persists
7189586 like his parents before him iddar was born a slave a status ascribed to him at birth and grew up under the total control of a master who exacted labour from him for no remuneration
7189587 in my view iddars case is a clear case of slavery
7189588 whats unique about our offering is that we host it we manage it and we charge just for its use whether there are just a few or numerous contributors at a low per user cost with no contracts and no strings
7189589 there is an incredible demand today for solutions that help businesses to harness the power of a global work force and the challenges that come with the explosive growth of digital information
7189590 youre ignorant so read up on what you need to do
7189591 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7189592 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determinate guidelines for law enforcement
7189593 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7189594 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7189595 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7189596 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7189597 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7189598 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7189599 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7189600 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7189601 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7189602 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7189603 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7189604 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7189605 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7189606 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7189607 its just weird i mean something happened to make this guy veer left off the runway
7189608 the fire was so intense theres not a lot of the plane left
7189609 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7189610 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7189611 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7189612 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7189613 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
7189614 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7189615 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7189616 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7189617 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7189618 try to use that word or those words more often
7189619 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7189620 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7189621 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7189622 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7189623 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7189624 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7189625 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7189626 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7189627 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7189628 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7189629 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7189630 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7189631 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7189632 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7189633 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7189634 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7189635 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7189636 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7189637 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7189638 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7189639 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7189640 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7189641 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7189642 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7189643 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7189644 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7189645 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7189646 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7189647 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7189648 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7189649 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7189650 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7189651 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7189652 youre the voice i hear inside my head the reason that im singing i need to find you i gotta find you
7189653 one of the most popular retellings of the story of the tragic king sharon kay penmans somber the sunne in splendor
7189654 whats unique about our offering is that we host it we manage it and we charge just for its use whether there are just a few or numerous contributors at a low per user cost with no contracts and no strings

7189662 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7189663 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7189664 as delaware sen joe biden left his home a few minutes ago golf clubs in tow he was asked where he was going to be on saturday
7189665 one pepsi plant is managed by an economics major with an mba and has a labor force with an average of 10 years of experience this plant produces a larger output than does an otherwise identical plant that is managed by someone with no business training or experience and that has a young labor force that is new to bottling
7189666 i worked with joe on this project and he showed me x y and z i learned so much working with him
7189667 people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost
7189668 wont just make a good vice president he will make a great vice president
7189669 he is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7189670 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done

7189675 they are definitely our high performing school because they stretch all students to do well
7189676 even the students who do well are stretched to do even better
7189677 i found out about a week ago when i was eating lunch and couldnt wait to get back to the building to tell everyone who would listen
7189678 there were about six of us here so i called a mini meeting around the counter and let them all know for the last three years weve been really close it feels good to know the state recognizes what weve known for a long time mckinley is a great school
7189679 every educator is looking for that silver bullet that can fix all that is wrong with the education system
7189680 we know it doesnt exist we just do everything under the mindset that every child can be excellent
7189681 tendemos a creer que no hacemos el papel de v ctima especialmente si estamos trabajando con nosotros mismos y ya nos consideramos concientes y fuera de este flagelo

7189700 there i did it i produced something today it may not be much but at least i produced something tangible
7189701 i just saw the ball go and tried to give it a chance ive had hat tricks before but this was the first one in high school
7189702 the ball took a wild bounce and went right underneath him it snagged the corner
7189703 he has a great set of skills to him this was their third game and you could tell they were a little more composed
7189704 i would have preferred a two goal deficit going into half
7189705 thats the hardest lead to hold on to if it had been 2 0 i think we could have crawled back a little bit
7189706 the first half those goals came from us taking advantage of some mistakes they had
7189707 we were able to capitalize on some holes they had in the back that being said they adjusted well in the second half and gave us a pretty tight fight
7189708 our young team that first half came out with some jitters
7189709 its our first varsity game first game in high school for a lot of our players second half we came out and played even
7189710 well just keep working hard what else can you do
7189711 everyone was very nervous but when it came time to race everyone just picked it up we ran hard ran relaxed and finished very well
7189712 it was pretty hot on the course but the pace never seemed too hard
7189713 we did some mile repeats at practice this week i think that helped i havent had a great showing at this meet since my freshman year i wasnt sure how things would unfold today the top three was my goal
7189714 i wasnt expecting to win i thinking maybe only the top 10
7189715 the second mile of the race was probably the key for me but i still doubted myself going into the last mile
7189716 we saw some good things but theres a few things that we still need to work on
7189717 you will be happily surprized by a long time friend
7189718 the heart may freeze or it can burn the pain will ease if i can learn there is no future there is no past i live this moment as my last theres only us theres only this forget regret or life is yours to miss no other road no other way no day but today
7189719 you come to love not by finding the perfect person but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly
7189720 im just so sorry that shes not going to be around with me as we grow old
7189721 when i told her i was thinking about running for president she said she wanted to be there for me and boy was she ever
7189722 we traveled together she traveled on her own for me she did interviews she bucked up the staff and volunteers she danced on the stage when we won she was a real force of nature in our campaign
7189723 i knew there were people who were threatening her and refusing to talk to her
7189724 i would say to her you know you dont have to be out there for me
7189725 i saw that up close and personal during my campaign
7189726 to ask where you got your shoes or if you were on a diet and if it was working
7189727 she leaves so much for us to try to live up to
7189728 people who knew her all their lives or people who just met her in a brief encounter all came away with memorable experiences she was funny she was self deprecating she was sassy she was so smart
7189729 its a real question whether the state should be on the hook for that large an expenditure for someone who is going to be in office for such a short period of time
7189730 what they want is for voters not to get a chance to vote on this in november
7189731 several circulators are being intentionally disingenuous as they ask for support for this issue

7189741 en un principio del juego se nos complicaron las cosas por que a pesar de que el equipo quiso proponer desde los primeros minutos el rival supo aprovechar dos errores que tuvimos para sorprendernos y tener la ventaja de dos goles sin embargo no se dej de luchar hasta el final por rescatar un mejor resultado y la muestra est en que alcanzamos a remontar el marcador que tiene un gran m rito obtener este triunfo
7189742 en el primero tiempo tuvimos muy poca posesi n de pelota lo que provoc darle espacios al rival esto quiere decir que debemos afinar ese tipo de detalles para estar m s atentos en los siguientes partidos pues no podemos estar remando contra corriente en cada jornada para tener una gran reacci n y rescatar buenos resultados

7189753 as the new academic year gets under way next week we will begin recruitment for spring 2009 programs and we are certainly hopeful that the rising value of the dollar will encourage more students to participate in programs in europe
7189754 oil prices have made airfares very expensive so getting to europe is still a big obstacle even if it is cheaper once one arrives
7189755 now the dollar does seem to be strengthening but i would think we have a lot of strengthening yet to come before this will negatively impact our position in the marketplace
7189756 for example a salary paid in euros or pounds if the dollar strengthens it means delta is not using so many dollars to pay employees

7189764 weve been schooled as to what we can go to legally and what we cant go to what kind of food you can have what kind of food you cant have

7189811 what can i do to make sure that the students pay attention to the descriptive details i know ill make them have to make a costume just like one of the outfits so vividly described in the book and then theyll recite some lines said by the character they choose it fits perfectly it lets the students choose which character they want to be or admire and it lets them choose their favorite part of the book and what to say it really appeals to different modalities and allows the students who like to be the center of attention the spotlight for a little while it fits perfectly and then for the rest of the students ill make them write a 50 page paper those types of students love writing right am i right im so right

7189853 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7189854 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7189855 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7189856 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7189857 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7189858 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7189859 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7189860 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all

7189865 the northern part of the district is the type of suburban middle class area where obama has been popular

7189873 then she did it two or three times the next day
7189874 they go through every aspect of your family and financial life
7189875 its a very intensive and intrusive process i never dreamed that somebody would have to read one of my speeches from 25 years ago
7189876 too much confusion discussing a relatively unknown congressman at the same time that another edwards was drawing the ire of the public
7189877 he said that he was going to make another choice he was very gracious

7189885 take a view of the performance of itv at the end of the year
7189886 to sit here and pick one time period on one night and characterise the performance of the schedule on the basis of the delivery of one or two shows is not the game were in at all
7189887 as we have seen in the full numbers we are enjoying our best start to a year that anyone can remember but not all shows have worked
7189888 bbc1 had a new show the other night with 2 3 million viewers do you say bbc1s schedule is falling apart no its very hard to launch new shows today
7189889 is itv looking more different today than it has for many years you bet it is is the creative community responding and wanting to work for us you bet they do for many years we were the last shop in town for anybody wanting to work for us
7189890 the schedule simon shaps inherited was tired predictable and we were down to a hardcore solid base of support for itv we have come a hell of a long way in the last couple of years particularly in the last year
7189891 i have never known a time in itvs history and ive been following it quite closely since 1955 when the schedule looked as fresh and reinvigorated as it does night after night
7189892 you may not like some of the shows some will catch on and some will not thats the nature of the game but people are talking about the itv schedule its an unbelievable change
7189893 it is an outlet for the personal computer please use it freely
7189894 nyt multimedia is still baby steps but its a hell of a lot more robust than even two years ago our multimedia now is embedded into the rhythm of the way we produce the web site and all of that is done in collaboration with the newsroom
7189895 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7189896 the dream will endure as a legacy to the kennedys
7189897 but it is just that today a dream its not the reality of american politics
7189898 the only moment of conciliation at that convention was the tribute to bob
7189899 i dont think many republicans would want their kids to get in the car with sen kennedy
7189900 voices who share barack obamas vision of making america stronger and safer
7189901 a new tough foreign policy approach that is neither republican nor democratic
7189902 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
7189903 the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need

7189907 the space program is the thing that gets overlooked the most
7189908 he got very animated and defensive about his vietnam policies
7189909 he stood up and waved his arms in front of me at one point
7189910 he believed in what he did in vietnam he very very much defended his position
7189911 great president he has a terrific legacy except for the stain of the war
7189912 she told me for black people johnson will be the greatest president there ever was
7189913 johnson was the last president to be successful with a major domestic agenda
7189914 you cant talk about 20th century politics or texas history for that matter without mentioning lbj
7189915 he teetered on the line between strong leader and veritable force of nature
7189916 its the opportunity for michelle to tell the story of her life
7189917 it will be a very personal story that she tells we want to give them voters a sense of the obama family and how they would be in the white house
7189918 i thought ok hes probably not all that terrific and hes probably kind of a clown and then i found out that his name was barack obama
7189919 and like everybody else i thought well what kind of name is that
7189920 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7189921 she has been absolutely savaged by the talk shows rush limbaugh and sean hannity pull her apart almost every day
7189922 she knows who she is and where she comes from
7189923 it first lady is one of the ultimate symbols of grace femininity and american womanhood it will take some americans a moment to have that symbolized by a black woman
7189924 on top of that with michelle obama theres the stereotype about the angry black woman some of her mannerisms will be looked at through a different magnifying glass because she is black
7189925 if you were to say who is the unluckiest person i know in the world

7189931 in a country that keeps such a tight grip on its own media and which severely restricts access to its markets by foreign media companies it is a guarantee that has been hotly disputed
7189932 if the olympics are portrayed as a well organized success the media will be accused of falling for a chinese propaganda exercise on the other hand if there are protests and they are properly covered there will be accusations from the chinese that the actions of an unrepresentative minority have been magnified out of proportion

7189935 no one in editorial checked the cuttings had they done so they would have seen that not a word had been printed elsewhere about the princes deployment and that might have alerted them to check the story with the ministry of defence to verify that it was true
7189936 the british press was on a voluntary news blackout but id be surprised if any other publication in australia or elsewhere in the world was aware of it this illustrates the challenge of marrying this kind of embargo with the 21st century media

7189939 also i want to see the confidence he has in that delivery
7189940 the last couple of weeks if you had asked me that i would have said i cant wait till its over ive mixed feelings
7189941 its obviously been a long association and i have had some fantastic times
7189942 this year has been a nightmare but i guess if you put it in with all the great times ive had then its not so bad
7189943 but this year has been extremely frustrating and disappointing its nobodys fault its just one of those things that happens in sport all the time
7189944 i thought jamal idris made a terrific debut he showed hes a good first grader of the future
7189945 his first 20 minutes was fantastic the pace of it caught up with him a little bit i think and he started cramping 15 to 20 minutes into the second half
7189946 but he certainly showed his strength and his speed and he can certainly jump and catch the ball
7189947 whether he stays there in first grade or not its hard to say but certainly on that performance you would think he would be there next week
7189948 he played well i thought he handled the step up pretty good and he was a handful
7189949 i thought they played particularly well probably the best theyve played for a long time
7189950 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7189951 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7189952 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7189953 that experience is going to make this experience that much better
7189954 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7189955 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7189956 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7189957 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7189958 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7189959 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7189960 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7189961 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7189962 if the number of victims which a disease claims is the measure of its significance then all diseases particularly the most dreaded infectious diseases such as bubonic plague and asiatic cholera must rank far behind tuberculosis
7189963 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7189964 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7189965 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7189966 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7189967 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7189968 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans to this new cause and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7189969 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7189970 if hes available well play him but i cant say hes available ive got no idea
7189971 hes one of our best players and knowing what he knows and who hes going to draw well weigh it up
7189972 were not going to expose players who arent right but if its an anthony rocca whos coming off a long term injury and hes available to play well then thats one of the things youd be pretty silly not to do
7189973 i am not about to get involved in how bad or how incidental it is we will judge it through the week
7189974 weve had to reinvent ourselves and sometimes you do that over a pre season weve had to do it through the season under massive pressure
7189975 south africans are a proud nation they want to be winners they want to back a winning side
7189976 one big message that we want to get out there is that we will never go out and lose a game on purpose
7189977 rome wasnt built in one day so i think we should be patient as the players should be more patient on the team
7189978 i would ask that the public still give us some time
7189979 the laws have changed you look at how we were caught fast asleep in the first half of the super 14 by not changing quick enough to the laws
7189980 i believe that we are on the right track and the players do believe it
7189981 its just that they have to get used to it and we will get used to it
7189982 yes we believe in it and i think we worked hard this whole week on exactly what we want to do on the field
7189983 its just about execution the chances are there but were making too many mistakes for international players thats unacceptable
7189984 were the springboks were the world champs and we lost two games in a row
7189985 i think if you go to the change room and you look at the players theyd be feeling worse than the crowd out there
7189986 its our jobs its our work its our passion its our lives and its unacceptable for us to play like that
7189987 i want to build a clock that ticks once a year
7189988 the century hand advances once every one hundred years and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium for the next 10 000 years
7189989 the german hit every bell as often and as hard as possible approach
7189990 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7189991 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7189992 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7189993 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7189994 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7189995 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7189996 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7189997 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7189998 the beijing olympics are another milepost in chinas transformation into an efficient market oriented and financially sophisticated economy and a more open society
7189999 it is a very competitive market its a lot different to melbourne
