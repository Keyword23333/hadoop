7320012 what might be called marginal histories are less likely to receive any more serious attention than the occasional article in a graphic design magazine
7320013 there are many unknown aspects of graphic design worthy of historical notice that get little or no attention because publishers do not see a quantifiable market
7320014 so it becomes the job of committed scholars and researchers and fans to buck the market trend and produce works for which the greatest reward is getting the word out

7320026 inserting the sabbath feature in the contract proposal without seeking the boards approval
7320027 investigate the recommendation from the baltimore city fire dept regarding ovens being left on during the sabbath
7320028 do these board members really believe that one elevator operating in shabbos mode for a few hours a week is going to have a detrimental effect on their lives while they were upgrading the elevators residents got along just fine with one elevator for months
7320029 this to me is pure form blatant bigotry masquerading as a concern over costs the cost issue should have been completely dissolved by mr hackermans generous offer and thats what the human relations commission found
7320030 its sad that theres a dispute over the inconvenience to people having an elevator stop on every floor once a week and on certain religious holidays
7320031 the government gets involved when people cant work these issues out on their own
7320032 but sometimes the state is obligated to say you must make a reasonable accommodation
7320033 i came up with the thought that this has to do with the first amendment protections it violated peoples religious rights in multiple dwelling residences operative word was reasonable this would have been reasonable and accommodating i see at as a protection
7320034 my clients arent going to put up with this they feel the investigation was pre determined also theres the cost of the feature its the extra wear and tear if you take one elevator out of general service its a real loss
7320035 hrc did a thorough investigation and that it ruled there was probable cause of discrimination and found no merit in any of the complaints made by the board

7320039 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10 a bushel they sure dont like to put it on the ground
7320040 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7320041 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure

7320048 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7320049 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7320050 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7320051 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7320052 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7320053 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7320054 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7320055 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7320056 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7320057 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7320058 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7320059 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7320060 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7320061 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan

7320080 russias actions have already erased the possibility of advancing legislative efforts to promote u s russian partnership including an agreement to allow for increased collaboration with russia on nuclear energy production
7320081 as goes the nuclear deal as goes u s russia relations
7320082 by walking away from the agreement the administration will be less willing to make excuses for moscow

7320096 i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for all the supporters who came here this weekend to support me
7320097 to come here to a new track we did a fantastic job it was really difficult to choose the right tires especially in qualifying but we did a perfect job in that and then making the pole position winning the race and making the fast lap i think it is nothing more we can ask for
7320098 weve had quite a strong weekend nice new circuit got some good points heikki kovalainen and the team got some good points it was just overall a solid weekend for us
7320099 it was my fault and unfortunately i ran over the guy who was refueling we need to look and see what really happened

7320101 we sailed into charleston harbor the summer of 2004 aboard a boat that was to take us around the world after embarking on our most excellent adventure we got as far as the bahamas before we broke the boat and i was blessed with a baby we came back to the states to attend to both things some time after arriving in charleston i was involved in an accident where the impact resulted in a perforated placenta three weeks later while on a visit to vero beach florida i went into labor and gave birth to my son dolton at only 23 weeks i didnt think he would survive you can only imagine the turmoil of emotions and fear that goes through a person after you have been through something like that i was 500 miles from my family and home and scared to death for this little child that was fighting for his life like most of us i had no access to the resources i would need to be near my child while he fought for this life i was near panic when a nurse came into my room and told me about the ronald mcdonald house for 157 days my son fought for his life through many surgeries infections and complications he won his life it cost him his eyesight but he doesnt seem to know it he sees things he just sees them differently i honestly feel that he would not have survived had he not had his family there with him everyday singing to him holding him and just being there for him day and night i could not have done that were it not for the ronald mcdonald house i owe them my sons life that is why when i heard that the new wing of the charleston ronald mcdonald house did not have artwork on the walls of the guest rooms i resolved to change that by trade i am a sea captain with a 100 tonne commercial license issued through the coast guard i have been driving boats since i was a little girl but dolton had many medical issues that made him temporarily too delicate to enter regular day care or school i went to plan b which for me is painting i have painted with colored bees wax for fifteen years as a hobby the technique is called encaustics and is actually the oldest medium still being used by artists today it died out when tempura was invented because it is difficult to work with and can never really be mastered today dolton is doing really well he is a regular three year old with all the tantrums and giggles of any child his age and hopefully this spring his doctors will clear him to be able to enter school we owe it all to the ronald mcdonald house and his doctors and nurses of course but as far as doltons spirits and will to fight that came from him having his family near him and that was made possible by the ronald mcdonald house i could never repay what they have done for my family but this is my way of saying thanks
7320102 we are very excited about this donation said barbara bond executive director ronald mcdonald house charities it is heartwarming to see someone who benefited from a ronald mcdonald house giving back to help our families that kind of caring is what our house is all about

7320320 a spokesman for the baton rouge police department said the agency does not track how many people are injured by gunfire unintended for them the advocate show stray bullets have derailed numerous lives across the parish in the past few years

7320338 obama jumped into political and religious quicksand by picking biden catholic bishops and voters will determine whether the obama biden ticket sinks into political oblivion
7320339 the question is will catholic bishops be courageous and clear or will they equivocate or remain aloof if catholic bishops priests and laity put catholic teaching on human life the ahead of the democrat party obama is doomed
7320340 the words of john paul ii are clear the issue is our courage and obedience
7320341 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children
7320342 when a parliamentary or social majority decrees that it is legal at least under certain conditions to kill unborn human life is it not really making a tyrannical decision with regard to the weakest and most defenseless of human beings in the case of an intrinsically unjust law such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia it is therefore never licit to obey it or to take part in a propaganda campaign in favour of such a law or vote for it the moral gravity of procured abortion is apparent in all its truth if we recognize we are dealing with murder
7320343 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children

7320358 behavioral morality the idea that any behavior with a physical cause is either not blameworthy or is less so
7320359 a moral being is one who is capable of reflecting on his past actions and their motives of approving of some and disapproving of others and the fact that man is the one being who certainly deserves this designation is the greatest of all distinctions between him and the lower animals
7320360 define objective reasonableness by a scientifically robust understanding of human behavior
7320361 suppose for example science is able to predict that all people with lesions of a certain size and shape in the frontal lobe who also have certain environmental triggers such as childhood abuse will become robbers as adults society may choose that given the distribution of normal human capacities that such persons cannot be held as agents under criminal law when they later rob as adults or society may also decide that because of the aspirational goals of the criminal law to set norms of human behavior that even those people will be held criminally accountable when they commit violent robberies but not when they commit other robberies criminal law will have to balance its goals promoting social welfare reifying and setting social norms with preserving its legitimacy if indeed one hundred percent of individuals are unable to comply with a set norm in criminal law and science can inform this criminal law will likely need to reformulate this norm

7320369 felipe has had an extraordinary weekend yesterday he was very quick in qualifying and today he drove in impeccable style without putting a foot wrong to take what was a very well deserved win after the disappointment of budapest i want to compliment him and the whole team who have worked so hard in preparing for this event unfortunately once again we have suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races now we must continue to push to the maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races we still have two test sessions at monza and then jerez and a lot of hard days work in the factory finally i want to say a few words about piero timpini our mechanic unfortunately injured in kimis second pit stop his first words were to say sorry as though the incident was his fault it is thanks to the passion dedication and professionalism that these guys show on a daily basis for ferrari how special is our team
7320370 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it has always done in the past
7320371 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
7320372 a great performance from felipe all weekend long he was fantastic and deserves all our praise unfortunately yet again we were not reliable both from a technical point of view and in how we operated on the track given what happened during raikkonens pit stop and then the failure of his engine which initial investigations seem to point at a similar failure to the one felipe experienced in hungary fortunately pietro timpini the mechanic operating the refueling injured at kimis second stop got away with just a small fracture to the left foot and it is not particularly serious today we have seen two sides of the coin we have a great potential from both the team and the car capable of putting us in front of everyone else but if not all elements are operating at their optimum then we are throwing away precious points that could cost us dear we must work to remedy these problems and thats what we will do starting in the days that follow

7320503 longstanding policy against publicly discussing third party widgets and applications as well as the details of terms of service violations
7320504 our only goal is to have you build your products in such a way that doesnt slow down the networks running your products or takedown the ning platform with what youre doing both of those would result in us needing to shutdown widgetlaboratory products and thats has never been our first choice of options hopefully you know this after 8 months of working with us
7320505 if we have evidence other than our conversation last night that you are asking for username password and pin of other network creators on widgetlaboratory we will be put in the unfortunate situation of shutting down your network and widgets we dont want to do this in fact wed like very much to work more closely together but we can only do so if everything you guys are doing is within the terms of service

7320518 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
7320519 i understand that we didnt play like last week but i also understand the reasons why
7320520 wigan played better than portsmouth they pressured us and they were playing at home the people can help more than they can when we are at stamford bridge
7320521 also i have had many problems this week michael ballack played with a little injury michael essien has not been training for 10 days then trains for two and i needed him to play 90 minutes and john mikel obi is out
7320522 but they fought and it was possible to win the game it is fantastic for chelsea and fantastic for our group because we have confidence and we have six points
7320523 its only two games if it was the last games of the season maybe there would be pressure but now no
7320524 estoy contenta de haber llegado a la final con carlos y carolina y haber compartido con un grupo de personas maravillosas de gran calidad humana y tengo un compromiso muy aparte con alan porque el sue o se le cumple de todas maneras

7320544 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7320545 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7320546 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams

7320558 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7320559 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7320560 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7320561 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7320572 bomber cas however at the joint cas symposium held at eglin the navy and marine corps were successful in not letting the air force call this by a different name
7320573 if heavy bombers are supporting ground troops in the traditional cas role then a name change for that aspect is not needed
7320574 precision firepower called in by tacps on the ground is gaps and needs its own doctrine
7320575 hey this is glenn and hes serving in choir and childrens church
7320576 the was a decision to try working from more simple songs and expanding them and abstracting them from there whereas when we did trees swallows houses we were finding our sound and a lot of it was spontaneous we would be like oh this sounds cool and work from there musically and figure out a way to piece it together this time we wanted to make a conscious decision to have these shorter songs that were more concise cohesive and catchy
7320577 i think going into this record we all had those goals in mind to make the songs a little simpler and easier to listen but not really we just wanted to strip things down a little bit
7320578 even in our attempt to do that the songs are just as technical if not trees swallows houses theyre just based more on layers theyre built upon chords and theres more harmony within those layers and we focused on the rhythms in a different way a less dissonant way trees swallows houses was really rhythmic but there were more stops that were jarring this is rhythmic in that it builds in they way that rhythm should build to be effective but we definitely like both of the records its just an attempt to accentuate the things that we really liked about what we did on the first ep
7320579 at the beginning of our band we were interested in writing stuff that was non narrative
7320580 that was sort of the very first step not even the stuff on trees swallows houses that was getting us to where we need to be it was really good that we did that for trees swallows houses we continued to want to write non narrative stuff but the lyrics mimic that style rather than actually stick to it because all of the songs are about things theyre based on events or people but we still wanted to keep it sort of non narrative not heres the story listen to this this is what happened to me now its over we wanted to write in a language that was evocative and expressed something that was real but hopefully was open enough that people could relate to it and i feel like especially during this summer and these tours i feel like that was successful people would come up to me and say this song made me think about this or that and its totally completely not what i would think some really strange angle but its totally valid and i really appreciate that people say is that what that songs about and i just say i dont know because i dont want to tell them thats the goal in my opinion in songwriting to get people to internalize anything that they hear and have it be reflective of their own experience i mean i have an interest in expressing myself but i dont have an interest in constantly recreating my own experience and just having people look at it
7320581 i would love to have sandy play with us anytime that she could she actually came to the record release show a long time ago and she gave us a cd of a band that she was playing in and she would just come to shows and was a really nice person then i realized she was a great musician too
7320582 she came in and already had all this stuff written and was really good shes a great musician but she lives in new york most of the time so she can play certain shows she hasnt been with us on the past couple tours but anytime that she wants to play im down and she played on the new ep too
7320583 we pretty much were planning on having end up being a full length when we were working on it we were getting ready to do a couple tours and we had the songs that are on it done and we got asked to do a couple more tours pretty much from april to now and into october have been completely filled up we were just like well we want to release this weve been working on this were going to go on tour and we want people to know what songs were playing that was the decision to make it an ep and we feel like it works as an ep too but the plans are definitely to make a full length probably after we get back from europe in mid october well start working on some stuff
7320584 above the gates of hell is the warning that all that enter should abandon hope less dire but to the same effect is the warning given to those who try to define terrorism
7320585 a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to the most pressing needs of the fatherland
7320586 the term terrorism means premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against non combatant targets by sub national groups or clandestine agents usually intended to influence an audience
7320587 states that support terrorist organizations providing financial aid ideological support military or operational assistance
7320588 states that initiate direct and perform terrorist activities through groups outside their own institutions
7320589 states perpetrating terrorist acts abroad through their own official bodies
7320590 the lack of a political solution and the number of credible reports of massive human rights violations we believe contribute to an environment that is favorable toward terrorism
7320591 i do not deny that i planned sabotage i planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation
7320592 as for their accusations of terrorizing the innocent the children and the women these are in the category of accusing others with their own affliction in order to fool the masses the evidence overwhelmingly shows america and israel killing the weaker men women and children in the muslim world and elsewhere
7320593 god knows it did not cross our minds to attack the towers but after the situation became unbearable and we witnessed the injustice and tyranny of the american israeli alliance against our people in palestine and lebanon i thought about it and the events that affected me directly were that of 1982 and the events that followed when america allowed the israelis to invade lebanon helped by the u s sixth fleet as i watched the destroyed towers in lebanon it occurred to me punish the unjust the same way and to destroy towers in america so it could taste some of what we are tasting and to stop killing our children and women

7320601 i assume we are going to hear more contrast between what democrats are about and what he is about versus mccain
7320602 we are going to hear a lot of connecting between mccain and bush

7320845 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7320846 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment

7320848 es uno de los acuerdos de la bancada del pri y una de las demandas de los gobernadores de extracci n priista ya que la reforma petrolera debe garantizar recursos financieros para los estados y para la modernizaci n de pemex
7320849 si bien existe la voluntad del pri de concretar una reforma petrolera no hay ning n acuerdo con el gobierno federal de avalar una iniciativa determinada por lo que esperaremos a que esta semana el prd presente su iniciativa para buscar coincidencias
7320850 esto da un margen muy alto de discrecionalidad que debe reducirse para aplicarse directamente en el presupuesto
7320851 cualquier reforma que avale el pri deber pasar por criterios diferentes en materia de transparencia en la paraestatal menor injerencia de la secretar a de hacienda en el reparto de recursos y m s atribuciones del congreso de la uni n en los manejos financieros

7320892 passed over clinton in his selection of a running mate because she had spoken too bluntly about obamas perceived shortcomings during their party primary battle
7320893 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear clinton spokeswoman kathleen strand said in a statement issued today
7320894 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7320895 we assume that your intentions are good but in fact the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organization in gaza
7320896 if one ventures a word with you will you become impatient but who can refrain from speaking behold you have admonished many and you have strengthened weak hands your words have helped the tottering to stand and you have strengthened feeble knees but now it has come to you and you are impatient it touches you and you are dismayed is not your fear of god your confidence and the integrity of your ways your hope remember now who ever perished being innocent or where were the upright destroyed according to what i have seen those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble harvest it by the breath of god they perish and by the blast of his anger they come to an end
7320897 we elect pro equality democrats and have come together to discuss the national platform language to insure that it is more inclusive for glbt people who seek equality as americans
7320898 we have 20 glbt people serving on the platform committee of 186 democrats
7320899 in 2004 we were able to succeed in having gay and lesbian families included in the language of that years platform and this year all families glbt have been included in the language not just gay and lesbian
7320900 we are creating a positive vision for the future we want a platform that most americans will embrace
7320901 we are included and empowered in the democratic party the party has target goals in terms of inclusion and glbt participation has exceeded the target goals whats important to glbt people are the same as all americans including healthcare jobs and union representation
7320902 a black candidate is important for civil rights its a barrier broken which is a barrier broken for all

7320905 the hillary and obama supporters are getting along we are here to elect one president barack obama
7320906 i was impressed that a young man of color was becoming a leader in the democratic party
7320907 i was shocked i had heard rumors but still was shocked when it happened i went to springfield and was there when he announced his candidacy it was very exciting obama is extremely supportive of gay rights as he is for equal rights for all americans
7320908 i believe that he will be a nurturing advocate of glbt people
7320909 there is a lot of power in just one vote
7320910 since i am unable to vote i have to get other people to vote so that i can have a future
7320911 the president has the power to do whatever he wants which effects everyone the election directly affects me and affects my future i want my future to be open with options right now america is complicated especially with the war i want things to change just like obama
7320912 obama represents progress in america he has a lot of courage and strength as the first black candidate i would be scared out of my mind if i were doing what obama is doing
7320913 it was my decision they didnt encourage me to do this i even get here on my own on the bus
7320914 barack obama has motivated aarons interest in politics he is very aware of the issues discusses them with friends and tries to create solutions he is making good choices im very proud of him

7320928 a man who lives in a box for five years can do whatever he wants
7320929 he has been preoccupied with escaping the shadow of his father and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others
7320930 he feels his experiences and performance as a p o w have finally permitted this to happen
7320931 what is true is that a number of p o w s in those first few years after their release often acted erratically their lives pockmarked by drastic mood swings and uncharacteristic behavior before achieving a more mellow equilibrium
7320932 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7320933 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7320934 the senator has even brought his military record into discussion of his music tastes explaining that his favorite song was dancing queen by abba he offered that his knowledge of music stopped evolving when his plane intercepted a surface to air missile dancing queen however was produced in 1975 eight years after mccains plane was shot down

7321028 diabetespati nten zijn zich niet altijd bewust van de risicos
7321029 they just ate what we ate and we used the happy baby food mill
7321030 and i do not have one extra minute in my day so if i can do it anyone can
7321031 i had one of these choices every day with a soda from the vending machine my kids arent going to eat that way
7321032 i use a food processor and small tupperware cups which i can freeze if the baby doesnt eat it all its literally a few pennies ive wasted i introduce each new food slowly one over three days
7321033 it took patience and holding my breath as they learned to use the stove but it was really worth it
7321034 its easier and faster just to do it yourself but whenever i took the time to teach my kids a skill i never regretted it
7321035 this is to teach our city youngsters how the milk gets into bottles
7321036 the french have seen the rise of obesity in the states and now in england they dont want to wait 30 years before addressing the problem fast food and processed food is very popular in france so its a real concern

7321041 we have to take care of the gfeller family and their wishes too but we have a football team i have to take care of and seven other coaches and we have to get ourselves back together and be able to get through this
7321042 there are 33 boys there and for every one of them there has been a different way to handle it like anything in grief there is a process but each one of them are handling it their own way and we will have to just help them through that
7321043 but you fall off the horse and you have to get back on it and thats what we will try to do and at the same time we will honor the gfeller familys wishes and keep the memory of matt alive in our minds and hearts
7321044 the release of these individuals combined with what we hope will be further positive steps offers the real possibility of a significant improvement in relations between the united states and belarus
7321045 discuss other steps belarus could take to improve respect for human rights and democracy
7321046 o ne of the concerns weve had all along with belarus is its holding of political prisoners and obviously theyve released the last of them t hats going to be an important step in terms of how we look at the future of the relationship
7321047 human rights concerns prompt continued u s sanctions on belarus
7321048 would obviously encourage the belarusians to treat him in a very humane fashion

7321053 the fans there are very enthusiastic so i am looking forward to putting on a great show and increasing my fan base

7321060 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad

7321109 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7321110 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7321111 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7321112 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7321113 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well

7321124 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7321125 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners chatters his very tires is what he did i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny hamlin got to his outside and he got by me and then i had to battle with him towards the end we were as clean as could be of course but just one other dude we had a problem with
7321126 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was really mad
7321127 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7321128 earlier this year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7321129 so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made and id do it again

7321172 but what it needs now is to be looked at from a practical perspective by technology companies and power plant management to see how it stacks up
7321173 because of the urgency of the environmental situation we have to do something now
7321174 this is not a long term solution but it could buy us 20 years or so to investigate new technologies

7321185 this is one bread and butter issue that no one can ignore
7321186 its a growing concern and its clearly one of the largest concerns people have
7321187 what we are experiencing is a demand shock coming from a new category of participant in the commodities futures markets
7321188 for 150 years people who are not commercial traders had no business being in the futures markets
7321189 to my sense there has to be a clear distinction between those who can legitimately trade and those who should not be trading
7321190 lets not make any accusations until we have some information
7321191 if there is found to be some forces other than market forces at work lets have a discussion about that but lets not put the cart before the horse

7321202 talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7321203 in his first event since choosing joe biden as his vice presidential nominee barack obama attacked many of joe bidens own positions on national security issues
7321204 we look forward to the debate between joe biden and barack obama over whether or not senator obama is qualified to be commander in chief
7321205 a sense of who she is and what her values are
7321206 the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenage years whenever a young man comes by for a date were going to have one of these mean looking guys with glasses they dont crack a smile
7321207 help cut taxes for middle class people who are working so hard
7321208 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7321209 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote
7321210 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7321211 senator joe bidens personal story has been tested many many times
7321212 when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has the kind of wisdom you get in the working class communities of scranton pennsylvania and wilmington delaware
7321213 theyre equally good tickets hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters
7321214 but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast
7321215 they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with senator clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else
7321216 knew her he knew her very well and so there wasnt the same need as there was for other candidates
7321217 theres no question that people had strong feelings about their nominee we went from beginning to end
7321218 i think thats going to be the role of the convention to really be a unifying time
7321219 hes got to talk about economic issues and hes got to be more clear
7321220 we need certainly senator obama to let the americans know what his plan is for as president of the united states how hes going to help rebuild restore the middle class
7321221 i dont accept that thats what barack obama hasnt been doing and i think that he will give a clear picture again this week of where we have to go
7321222 joe biden works in washington but he doesnt live there
7321223 he is somebody who never has forgotten where hes from hes a down to earth kind of guy
7321224 you can pull up a lot of quotes from august when these two guys were running against each other
7321225 its a legitimate issue mccain either forgot how many he has or he just wasnt being truthful with those reporters
7321226 youre out of touch if you have seven houses and dont even remember
7321227 the west has changed the independents in the west are really looking for leadership
7321228 the change that obama speaks of weve previewed it in the west
7321229 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7321230 it is interesting that obama would pick an older rich white male
7321231 when i saw what randal williams had designed i knew i had to help in getting it in the hands of the average person or the experienced pros
7321232 when it comes to exploding your business this is it
7321233 randal and i have been partners on several projects and have shared ideas and strategies for three years now we could have gone into direct competition do a joint venture or simply partner up if me partnering with randal and the 500k power recruiter is a smart move for me then what should that be telling marketers coast to coast im thrilled and those who join us will be too
7321234 randal and i feel the same about how to treat and train those we work with the most frustrating aspect of our job responsibility is seeing folks become frustrated and fail this technology is state of the art combined with our professionalism and experience our guys are growing leaps and bounds predictably so
7321235 it is time for the change that the american people need
7321236 with joe biden by my side i am confident that we can take this country in a new direction
7321237 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman who doesnt hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7321238 my mom and dad raised me to believe the test is not how many times you get knocked down
7321239 it is how quickly you get up thats the america that barack obama and i believe in
7321240 really i was thinking maybe he would choose colin powell
7321241 ive seen the u s guys hungry and wanting to get back to the top and thats what they did it wasnt so much individual talent it was teamwork
7321242 we have not had one second of problem as a coaching staff with our team
7321243 its been the greatest experience of my life and was for the other coaches too
7321244 everybody wants to talk abut nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals what you saw today was a team binding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7321245 we put in our time we put in our hearts we sacrificed our summers to play the game of basketball which we love to do
7321246 now that i look back at 04 its a blessing
7321247 we were at americas lowest point in 04 and to be sitting here being on top of the world i think we did a helluva job putting american basketball back where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world im just so proud right now
7321248 a party that took a long time coming but was over in a jiffy
7321249 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7321250 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7321251 i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7321252 it was a good effort but all credit to darren
7321253 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance
7321254 ive been offered several teams from different countries but i havent signed anything yet
7321255 if a player didnt want to play for me i know what id do id drive him myself to wherever he wants to go
7321256 ive said it before no player is bigger than any club
7321257 sometimes you have to lose to win tottenham have lost against sunderland but long term it might be best for the business

7321261 the more that the american people come to accept that any federal agency with power is somehow a police power we are piece by piece building the police state that the left worries about
7321262 both left and right ought to be worried about the expansion of federal criminal law if we value our liberty which the founders understood meant leaving general police powers at the local level
7321263 kami tetap puas dengan hasilnya karena target kita di sini adalah mencetak poin di kejurnas aprc

7321265 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7321266 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7321267 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7321268 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7321269 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7321270 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7321272 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7321273 do not think that this year is your last year as head of the government no act as if you will stay in charge for five years
7321274 imagine that this year plus the four that follow you will be in charge and plan and act accordingly
7321275 blocking dangerous trends of western intoxication and secularism which were infiltrating the countrys administration
7321276 the guide of the revolution as always but more clearly and more strongly than ever before has given his support to his revolutionary children
7321277 i hope that these comments in support of the governments actions will put an end to the propaganda being spread against it
7321278 if part of this plan fuels inflation a way must be found to prevent this or control any negative aspects
7321279 but the current governments characteristics mean it has warmer support
7321280 denying its positive aspects and highlighting weaknesses and constantly speaking against it is sabotage not criticism

7321298 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7321306 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7321307 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7321308 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7321309 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7321310 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7321317 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

7321340 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7321341 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7321342 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7321343 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7321344 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7321345 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7321346 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7321347 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7321348 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7321349 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7321350 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7321351 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7321352 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7321353 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7321354 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7321355 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7321356 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7321357 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7321358 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

7321360 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7321361 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7321362 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7321363 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7321364 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7321365 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7321366 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7321367 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7321368 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7321369 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7321370 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7321372 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

7321380 whats the difference i mean besides the obvious shape differences between a hotdog and piece of bologna have you ever wondered that hmm
7321381 of course not no one wonders about those kinds of things we wonder about who will win the super bowl or whether virginia oldman is wearing panties under that tight skirt or whether were going to get out of a strange predicament alive the exact scientific breakdown of what constitutes a hotdog and what constitutes bologna isnt high on the list but im curious now and you should be too
7321382 you dont know youre pathetic looking at you through the sites of this here mauser youre even more pathetic than i originally thought
7321383 please sir you dont have to hold all of us you can let some of us go
7321384 hmm and i suppose youd be the first to go isnt that right
7321385 n n no sir not at all release one of the women
7321386 spare me your self righteous chivalry we both know what youre really made of would it help you better if i guaranteed youd get out of this alive fine i guarantee it at least i guarantee that i will not shoot you cant say what the copsll do when they storm the place
7321387 but sir there are nine of us you dont need all of us
7321388 oh but i do i do my mauser has eight shells you see
7321389 mr hammerstein perhaps you would do better to just shut up for a moment and ask yourself a simple question why is it that you and you alone are the only one of my victims here who is not gagged
7321390 you disgust me you dont even take a second to think about it and youre already begging for the answer but i suppose youll never be able to come up with it on your own so i ask you to look at this woman here whats her name
7321391 tell me have you ever slept with mi mi michelle
7321392 its a shotgun mr hammerstein not a rifle and i think ill keep it right here on temple for a second longer i want you to look deep into her eyes you see how frightened she looks right now
7321393 no you only think youre terrified none of you has died yet perhaps mi mi michelle will be the first to go you hold her life in your hands now mr hammerstein
7321394 what do you want just tell me what you want
7321395 whether an inmates crime was especially callous or shockingly vicious or lethal
7321396 the ultimate conclusion that an inmate continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety
7321397 to normally grant parole to life prisoners who have committed murder
7321398 alone rarely will provide a valid basis for denying parole when there is strong evidence of rehabilitation and no other evidence of current dangerousness
7321399 im ready to start living my life i couldnt do that before because it was so up in the air
7321400 the awesome responsibility of deciding whether to release a convicted murderer on parole an act that inherently runs the risk that the inmate will again kill an innocent person lies with the executive branch not the judicial branch
7321401 she did this as a birthday present to herself because she was disappointed that her lover would not leave the victim for her
7321402 murder was the culmination of many years of violent and brutalizing behavior toward the victim his children and his previous wife
7321403 sends a clear message to prisoners that if they work really hard to rehabilitate themselves they are going to get some justice in the justice system
7321404 hopefully it wont be opening the door for a lot of life inmates to get out
7321405 it can work for microsoft too if it can deliver
7321406 blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered
7321407 oh my gosh i have to get this done for a few hours from now

7321410 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7321411 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7321412 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7321413 i love this piece because its the disconnect we dont know our neighbors
7321414 im sure he planned it that theyre really close but not touching
7321415 it really fed into the art programs in the schools and how to grow them it was wonderful
7321416 its a great example of how museums address societal needs
7321417 the primary objective for this program is to come away with a better sense of modern and contemporary art
7321418 you can see the light bulbs and the sparks going off as theyre getting new ideas each day
7321419 plus im really excited that teachers in other disciplines want to use art to teach
7321420 in general i think its a challenging time for the arts in the schools in america
7321421 we know that from lots of different research that the arts are a great benefit to the advancement of children in schools and in life
7321422 its very clear that appreciating art and learning about art is a step in critical thinking
7321423 it exposed me to art that i had not spent a lot of time with before and of course i loved going to all five museums
7321424 the first question they ask me is is this person alive
7321425 the more i learn about it myself the easier it is to teach obviously
7321426 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido

7321429 i told myself to play like i did when i was a kid it was a very pleasing day
7321430 but its hard to expect to duplicate what they just did to you that soon
7321431 if they dont shut down that offense we never get to that point
7321432 the decision makes sense but it was something i didnt want to hear at the time
7321433 weve never had a complaint from a customer about people spamming them because of their idisk public folder name there is no way to remove your account name from the idisk folders im very sorry

7321463 ive no doubt that hell return it could take 15 days it could take a month but theres no doubt that this country cant live without economic aid
7321464 were looking at a military coup detat in the full sense of the word
7321465 the future of democracy in africa is at stake if this coup is allowed to stand and it wont be then all the democracies in africa are entirely threatened
7321466 speaking as a son i know that a president shouldnt be treated like that its against common law because even terrorists and common prisoners can be visited by their family
7321467 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7321468 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7321469 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7321470 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7321471 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7321472 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7321473 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7321474 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7321475 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7321476 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7321477 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7321478 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7321479 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7321480 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7321481 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7321482 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7321483 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7321484 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7321485 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7321486 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7321487 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7321488 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7321489 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7321490 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7321491 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7321492 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7321493 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7321494 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7321495 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7321496 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7321497 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7321498 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7321499 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7321500 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7321501 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7321502 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7321503 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7321504 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7321505 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7321506 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7321507 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7321508 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7321509 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7321510 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7321511 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7321512 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7321513 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7321514 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7321515 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

7321518 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7321519 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7321520 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7321521 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7321522 i thought he said there wasnt much custom code needed
7321523 your battleships attack at 7 2 resulted in a hit
7321524 gonna lift us up where we belong where the eagles fly and the mountain high
7321525 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7321526 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7321537 several economic indicators suggest that growth rates in lending activity for the canadian banks will moderate while real estate prices may decline during a period of rising unemployment
7321538 with a weakening economy we believe domestic personal and commercial earnings are at risk of significant decline
7321539 the banks face significant longer term pressure on valuations stemming from u s economic deterioration
7321540 its unlikely that the present valuation level for the canadian banks is sustainable
7321541 it certainly looks as if the results from the u s subsidiaries of canadian banks particularly bank of montreals u s bank harris are deteriorating
7321542 with rising risk in u s platforms and market sensitive businesses struggling the importance of domestic retail earnings has increased

7321571 there have been rumors recently about my health they hurt believers inside and outside iraq they are incorrect
7321572 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7321573 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7321574 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7321575 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters

7321578 women have the most to win the most to gain with the election of barack obama and the most to lose with the election of john mccain
7321579 part of what we do as americans is come together and serve those who are more in need
7321580 theres this sense of newness of something that is different its a new period in americas relationships with the rest of the world
7321581 theres a really high interest on both the democratic and the republican side ive gotten calls from maybe 35 embassies that are interested in their ambassador coming
7321582 i had one person who called from a european country he was a minister of defense he was going to denver and wanted to go to minneapolis he wanted to know if there were any think tanks dealing with defense issues
7321583 they are interested in foreign policy stuff what would the foreign policy of obama or mccain look like
7321584 in places like central and eastern europe when they were struggling to be democratic
7321585 america is still looked to for leadership despite its diminished stature
7321586 signaled a real commitment to re engage to find solutions to global challenges from the environment to the growing financial crisis
7321587 people told me they still liked americans but just couldnt understand how george bush was elected twice
7321588 now people are saying that if we can achieve a lot of dialogue that would be a lot better than military conflict
7321589 give dialogue a chance and if theres a conflict make sure you dont do it alone do it with allies

7321597 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7321598 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7321599 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

7321650 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7321651 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7321652 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7321653 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

7321655 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7321656 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7321657 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7321658 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7321659 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them

7321664 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7321678 we would be remiss if we didnt prepare for mass arrests
7321679 people would sit in buses waiting hours days to be processed if we didnt have this set up
7321680 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7321681 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment
7321682 it has a chilling effect on free speech and that has been found time and time again to be improper under first amendment principles
7321683 i think its amazing after such a bad result to come here to a new track and do a fantastic job
7321684 it was difficult to choose the right tyres particularly in qualifying and i think we did a perfect job on that
7321685 making the pole position winning the race and making the fastest lap theres nothing more we can ask for especially after such a bad result
7321686 we still need to work very hard becasue today we had another problem with kimi and another one in the garage
7321687 we need to look forward we have time to work and have so many important races in front of us im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7321688 the first stint was nothing special but very good every lap i was pulling away by a couple of tenths
7321689 in the second stint we won the race there because the car was just perfect it was amazing to see the gap increasing
7321690 then in the last stint with the grip on the track and the temperature the car was even better on the soft tyres so i managed to drive in a really relaxing way but i was still doing similar lap times to the second stint the car was just perfect during the whole race
7321691 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war

7321706 im here today to tell the democrats that enough is enough
7321707 the choice between democrats and republicans is no choice at all
7321708 what we have now is a country by the corporations of the corporations and for the corporations
7321709 they wont shut us up and they wont shut me up
7321710 well you dont have the war in iraq if you dont have the war here
7321711 the result was far more important than the performance today
7321712 wigan have a very good squad good organisation and are very athletic but my players fought hard and you must come to places like wigan and win if you want to be involved in the title race
7321713 untuk 2009 yang jelas pks sedang konsentrasi untuk memaksimalkan pemenangan legislatif agar target 20 persen terpenuhi kalau pks bisa dapat 20 persen atau terlibat koalisi hal yang sama membuat susunan kabinet bayangan akan kita lakukan di tahun depan

7321718 en qualsevol moment entren ac els de seguretat i ja la tenim armada
7321719 if a player didnt want to play for me i know what id do id drive him myself to wherever he wants to go
7321720 ive said it before no player is bigger than any club
7321721 sometimes you have to lose to win tottenham have lost against sunderland but long term it might be best for the business
7321722 ive been offered several teams from different countries but i havent signed anything yet
7321723 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7321724 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7321725 i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7321726 it was a good effort but all credit to darren
7321727 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance
7321728 lack of experience attack against obama with mccain being 72 his vp might be president
7321729 i will commit to this team until i cant walk no more
7321730 to win another one lisa leslie got four and she wore all four to the game tonight i want to catch lisa i want to catch michael phelps
7321731 im just so excited about how many want to go forward
7321732 i know we have a lot of great young talent in the nba that will probably be on the 2012 team im more than committed to being on this team again
7321733 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7321734 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7321735 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7321736 the young guys coming up that want to be a part of this make sure you have right mindset
7321737 thats be unselfish with everything its not about you shining its about the team shining
7321738 they had a bad start before they left for athens in 2004 but with lebron and those guys coming back for this and telling everyone how cool it is its going to be a hot ticket theres going to be a lot of competition to play for this team
7321739 now the world stage is going to be lifted because the world sees we are taking everything seriously
7321740 so that playing for the united states in the olympics becomes the thing they really want to do
7321741 is going to be one of the worst moments in the entire campaign
7321742 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7321743 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7321744 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7321745 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7321746 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7321747 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7321748 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7321749 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7321750 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7321751 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7321752 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7321753 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7321754 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7321755 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7321756 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7321757 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7321758 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7321759 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7321760 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7321761 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7321762 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7321763 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7321764 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7321765 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7321766 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7321767 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7321768 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7321769 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7321770 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7321771 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7321772 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7321773 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7321774 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7321775 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7321776 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7321777 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7321778 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7321779 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7321780 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7321781 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7321782 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7321783 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7321784 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7321785 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7321786 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7321787 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7321788 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7321789 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7321790 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7321791 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7321792 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7321793 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7321794 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7321795 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7321796 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7321797 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7321798 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7321799 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7321800 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7321801 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7321802 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7321803 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7321804 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7321805 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7321806 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7321807 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7321808 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7321809 when hillary clinton speaks at the democratic national convention on wednesday night she will blow this ad out of the water
7321810 this was a hard fought and very long race and as youve already said 21 debates i mean you say a lot of things you try and get an edge over your opponent but right now i dont think theres any question at all that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama they want to see a democrat elected president of the united states
7321811 hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters whove been following her for a long time but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast because hes a tremendously engaging guy a tremendously bright guy and a guy whos sort of harry trumanlike he tells it like it is
7321812 well first of all let me say that i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7321813 cindys father barely finished high school went off and distinguished himself in world war ii in a b 17 and he came back with practically nothing and realized the american dream and i am proud and grateful for that and i think he is a role model to many young americans who serve in the military and come back and succeed
7321814 so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it
7321815 we spend our time primarily in washington dc where i have a condominium in crystal city here in this beautiful sedona that im blessed every moment i can spend here our condominium in phoenix arizona and a place over in san diego the others are also for investment purposes so all i can say is i am blessed to have the opportunity to continue to be part of a country where you can succeed and do well
7321816 he says he has seven kitchen tables we dont want him to have an eighth kitchen table
7321817 and we understand that he has a wonderful life this is a great this is a great country but millions of americans at this hour are suffering through a housing market that is collapsed housing foreclosures and so when john mccain gets up in the morning and he leaves his house to lock his door he has to shuffle through a number of keys to figure out which key works in which door in which home hes at at any given time that suggests bob a significant disconnect between the average american who is experiencing quite a different economy than the one john mccain has been advocating
7321818 theyre going to say look john mccain good man american hero but he wants to extend the bush administration
7321819 of course were going to fire back and we should fire back
7321820 but it can be done in a way thats poetic and substantive
7321821 a vantagem principal a continuidade que pode ficar ali o tempo todo

7321839 barangsiapa yang diberi rezeki oleh allah berupa makanan hendaklah membaca
7321840 ya allah berilah berkah apa yang engkau rezekikan kepada mereka ampunilah dan belas kasihanilah mereka
7321841 makan dan minumlah dan janganlah berlebih lebihan sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang berlebih lebihan
7321842 jika dalam satu jamuan ada dua jenis atau beberapa macam lauk atau jenis makanan yang lain maka diperbolehkan untuk mengambil makanan yang tidak berada di dekat kita apabila hal tersebut dimaksudkan untuk memilih makanan yang dikehendaki

7321845 jika kalian makan maka janganlah makan dari bagian tengah piring akan tetapi hendaknya makan dari pinggir piring karena keberkahan makanan itu turun dibagian tengah makanan
7321846 hadits tentang cuci tangan sesudah makan adalah hadits yang berstatus hasan tidak terdapat hadits yang shahih tentang cuci tangan sebelum makan
7321847 barang siapa yang tidur dalam keadaan tangannya masih bau daging kambing dan belum dicuci lalu terjadi sesuatu maka janganlah dia menyalahkan kecuali dirinya sendiri
7321848 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam melarang dua jenis makanan yaitu duduk dalam jamuan makan yang menyuguhkan minum minuman keras dan makan sambil tengkurap
7321849 tidak sah shalat saat makanan sudah disajikan dan pada saat menahan buang air besar dn buang air kecil

7321851 jika ada makanan yang jatuh maka jangan dibiarkan akan tetapi diambil jika pada makanan tersebut ada kotoran maka dibersihkan dan kotorannya tidak perlu dimakan karena kita tidaklah dipaksa untuk memakan sesuatu yang tidak kita sukai
7321852 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sama sekali tidak pernah mencela makanan jika beliau menyukai satu makanan maka beliau memakannya jika beliau tidak suka maka beliau meninggalkannya
7321853 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tidak pernah menyantap makanan dalam keadaan masih panas
7321854 jika kalian minum maka janganlah mengambil nafas dalam wadah air minumnya
7321855 ketika rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam minum beliau mengambil nafas di luar wadah air minum sebanyak tiga kali
7321856 oleh karena itu ketika aku minum aku bernafas tiga kali
7321857 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam melarang minum dari mulut ghirbah wadah air yang terbuat dari kulit atau wadah air minum yang lainnya hr bukhari no 5627
7321858 sesungguhnya orang yang menyuguhkan minuman kepada sekelompok orang adalah orang yang minum terakhir kali
7321859 makan satu orang itu cukup untuk dua orang makanan dua orang itu cukup untuk empat orang makanan empat orang itu cukup untuk delapan orang
7321860 tidaklah seorang manusia memenuhi satu wadah yang lebih berbahaya dibandingkan perutnya sendiri sebenarnya seorang manusia itu cukup dengan beberapa suap makanan yang bisa menegakkan tulang punggungnya namun jika tidak ada pilihan lain maka hendaknya sepertiga perut itu untuk makanan sepertiga yang lain untuk minuman dan sepertiga terakhir untuk nafas
7321861 barang siapa yang benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir maka janganlah menghadiri perjamuan yang mengedarkan khamr
7321862 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu menolong agama allah niscaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu
7321863 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7321864 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7321865 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

7321868 when it seems like everything is going to fall apart they figure out the key to working together as an ensemble is what we call showing up as yourself
7321869 the staff did such a great job but the last thing you want is 12 people in an operating room looking into your brain and no one is smiling
7321870 had a bunch of holes in it and so it had basically reconfigured itself
7321871 and its finally a word i can look forward to using

7321898 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7321899 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7321900 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7321901 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7321902 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7321903 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7321904 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7321905 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7321906 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7321907 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7321908 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7321909 were wearing aprons but everybody whos here the agents the editors the faculty the fellows the other contributors knows that this person whos waiting on you is going to be a very important writer in four or five years
7321910 so for us its kind of amazing and i think for everybody its kind of amazing
7321911 its humbling we handle compost things spill theres a lot of running
7321912 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7321913 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening
7321914 i took a lot of naps and a lot of advil
7321915 they are planning to target colleges and universities with a new version of the kindle
7321916 after careful review and consideration we are pleased to inform you that we have stopped collecting new york sales tax effective august 21 2008
7321917 this decision was driven by your direct and candid feedback and our continued commitment to you as our valued customers
7321918 a man who lives in a box for five years can do whatever he wants
7321919 he has been preoccupied with escaping the shadow of his father and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others
7321920 he feels his experiences and performance as a p o w have finally permitted this to happen
7321921 what is true is that a number of p o w s in those first few years after their release often acted erratically their lives pockmarked by drastic mood swings and uncharacteristic behavior before achieving a more mellow equilibrium
7321922 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7321923 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7321924 the senator has even brought his military record into discussion of his music tastes explaining that his favorite song was dancing queen by abba he offered that his knowledge of music stopped evolving when his plane intercepted a surface to air missile dancing queen however was produced in 1975 eight years after mccains plane was shot down
7321925 and dont talk to me about him being an ex marine
7321926 lord that was 40 years ago a lot of stuff can happen in 40 years
7321927 your best performance bet with cgi is to use one of the simpler tools like cgi fasttemplate or text template
7321928 some have additional features such as caching which would greatly help twiki performance for viewing pages
7321929 i think it would have been so historic to have both a woman and a
7321930 its awesome im busy can always be busier but im lucky to be as busy as i am now i wrestle pretty much every weekend and thats all i can ask for
7321931 everybodys opinion is just something that motivated me to try and up my game in every aspect if people thought i was missing that one thing obviously there was something that wasnt connecting me to everybody which is the point in this business is to connect with everybody no matter who they are
7321932 right now things are going good theres a decent amount of young guys that are looking to work hard and earn their stripes and take the next step to become a better performer and a better pro wrestler so i think right now all the companies are doing sort of what they need to do to work together and help and keep everyone busy because thats the only way you can really learn in this business is to wrestle as much as you possibly can in front of different people and different crowds
7321933 there are a handful of groups that are doing right for this business in florida im pretty impressed with it actually
7321934 just having the opportunity to do the things ive done in ring of honor thats the first major test if i can stay there as long as i possibly can and make it there i can see no reason why i couldnt go anywhere else and stay for just as long
7321935 sometimes when that camera gets in your face i just lock up im not going to deny it its truthful and sometimes things dont come off the way i really feel about them its like anything anybody does like an actor tom cruise wasnt tom cruise right off the bat its all a matter of just finding your niche and finding out whats comfortable to you and what can put you into that character the easies thats the only way that you do get better
7321936 when you work with people you teach them the things you know and i try not to teach anything outside of my boundaries because obviously i dont know it if i dont have an understanding of it i wont try to teach somebody that it brings you back to your first day your second day so as you teach the people you kind of go through those steps again and you catch a lot of your flaws that you were making and didnt realize you were making because you havent been critiqued specifically as you are critiquing this person
7321937 it was a great opportunity when i was there and my face was on tv a lot in my four or five months that i was actually going on tv so i appreciated the opportunity there
7321938 me and austin aries got suspended we were asked to leave a ring of honor show early and miss it and fly into orlando for the pay per view we let them know that we would be making it to the pay per view but we had to fulfill our commitment to ring of honor as well we ended up making it to the pay per view just late and they suspended us because of that it was their decision and it was right in their book so im not going to argue with them about that
7321939 its just something in this business if you say you are going to be there you want to be there no matter what thats the way that people can believe in you and trust you in a business where trust is very important
7321940 jeremia voordat ik je vormde in de moederschoot had ik je al uitgekozen voordat je geboren was had ik je al aan mij gewijd
7321941 nee jeremia je bent niet te jong ik zal je de woorden in de mond leggen die jij moet zeggen
7321942 wij zijn onze voorvader jonadab gehoorzaam geweest in alles wat hij ons gezegd heeft niemand van ons drinkt wijn wij bouwen geen huizen we bezitten geen akkers en hebben geen wijngaarden we hebben altijd in tenten geleefd wij trekken rond om zo aan voedsel te komen
7321943 8 wij zijn onze voorvader jonadab de zoon van rechab gehoorzaam geweest in alles wat hij ons geboden heeft
7321944 we figured wed be fine if they said disperse wed disperse but we never got the chance
7321945 you cant compare new york which has buildings all around to denver that has open areas
7321946 we would be remiss if we didnt prepare for mass arrests
7321947 people would sit in buses waiting hours days to be processed if we didnt have this set up
7321948 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7321949 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment
7321950 it has a chilling effect on free speech and that has been found time and time again to be improper under first amendment principles
7321951 the operation continues to be a disaster and is getting worse by the day
7321952 we live in challenging times in the 21st century to put someone with his foreign policy and national security expertise onto the ticket really helps us and ensures that we will rise to the challenges in an important way
7321953 joe has been one of the most articulate democratic opponents of barack obama he has been highly critical of him in a variety of venues so i think for him to be selected to join the ticket as vice president will be a surprise to republicans democrats and independents as well
7321954 we really wanted to make everyone in the u s aware of what were doing in africa and create a youth led movement against hiv and aids in this world
7321955 it will be 550 miles on the road and every day there will be a different event
7321956 they dont feed you they dont let you drink they dont let you sleep then you have to deal with everyones expletive
7321957 being in africa opened my eyes to what was happening
7321958 being involved with it having a personal connection with it
7321959 and then we finally won a chicken i was so psyched
7321960 last time i heard about a nice jewish boy camping was when he fell off a tour bus in israel
7321961 de kans dat ze jezus in dat graf vinden is niet aanwezig
7321962 ben jij op weg naar de hemel of op weg naar de hel
7321963 de mens van vandaag houdt er verkeerde opvattingen op na hij doet waarheid als onwaarheid af en onwaarheid als waarheid zo is er bijvoorbeeld iemand die een makkelijk leventje wil leiden met goed voedsel en zonder te werken dat is een verkeerde opvatting zelfs wanneer men ademt eet en zich beweegt werkt men niemand kan dus aan werken ontsnappen zo is er ook gezegd dat de dwaas al ziende blind is dat geldt ook voor het zien van god het ervaren van god en het genieten van god hij zegt dan ik wil god zien alles wat je ziet is een manifestatie van god alles waarvan je geniet is een uitdrukking van goddelijkheid is god op de een of andere verre plek te vinden liefde is de vorm zelf van god alles wat je kunt zien is goddelijk de kosmos is god dit alles zien en god niet ervaren is pure dwaasheid de oorzaak voor dit alles ligt in een geestestoestand die je kunt vergelijken met een met stof bedekte spiegel de geest kan pas klaar en helder zien wanneer het stof is verwijderd het hart dat van nature zuiver is wordt bedekt met onzuiverheden die door de geest gecre erd zijn in plaats van deze onzuiverheden te verwijderen voegt de mens er nog meerdere aan toe en daardoor kan hij dan de geest binnenin hem niet gewaarworden de onstandvastigheid van de denkende geest is het gevolg van twijfel en achterdocht die uit gehechtheden en haatgevoelens voortkomen voortdurend wordt de mens achtervolgd door twijfels en zorgen de grondoorzaak hiervoor is dat hij zelfs in zichzelf te weinig vertrouwen heeft twijfels doen voorkeuren en afkeuren ontstaan die hem als slangen sarren daarom dient de mens een vast vertrouwen aan te kweken zo niet in god dan toch in ieder geval in zichzelf zelfvertrouwen zal tot godsvertrouwen leiden omdat hij en god niet verschillend van elkaar zijn
7321964 gras is groen dat jij dat niet ziet betekent niet dat gras rood is
7321965 dat klopt enkel als je uitgangspunt is dat gras groen is
7321966 wie mijn bloed niet drinkt en mijn vlees niet eet zal geen verlossing ervaren
7321967 god als persoon is slechts een metafoor om makkelijker over hem te kunnen praten
7321968 maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat god geen persoonlijkheid heeft niet kan denken en al helemaal niet oordeelt
7321969 de man met de baard is in het immense heelal nooit waargenomen net zomin als donar met zijn strijdwagen op de wolken door geen enkele vliegtuigpassagier ooit is waargenomen voor de meeste astronomen is religie dan ook een afgehandelde zaak het verschil in mentaliteit zit hem voornamelijk in het verschil tussen de aannames van het geloof die onveranderd blijven en de wetenschappelijke benadering waardoor een verklaring voor de wereld zo als die zich aan ons voordoet met bewijs wordt gestaafd een betere theorie verwerpt altijd de theorie die minder is wetenschappers hoeven geen oorlog te voeren over de lading van het elektron het is een feit
7321970 wij zijn onze hersenen ons lichaam dient er toe om onze hersenen voort te bewegen van voedsel te voorzien en voort te planten wij zijn zeer complexe automaten met een bewustzijn onze hersenen berekenen onze beslissingen en bepalen ons gedrag ons bewustzijn hobbelt daar achteraan en heeft weinig invloed wij worden deels bepaald door ons dna en deels tijdens de vroege ontwikkeling van onze hersenen
7321971 je kunt mensen alles wijsmaken kijk maar naar wat ze allemaal geloven je kunt ook allerlei herinneringen inplanten bij weldenkende intelligente mensen onderwijs op basis van geloof zou verboden moeten worden en alle religie zou uit het openbare leven gebannen moeten worden de vrijheid van onderwijs en de vrijheid van godsdienst wordt misbruikt om kinderen te indoctrineren waardoor zij als enigen geen vrijheid van onderwijs en godsdienst hebben
7321972 religie heeft niets met compassie en zet aan tot homohaat daarom moet alle religie verboden worden
7321973 i love the idea of the teachings of jesus christ and the beautiful stories about it which i loved in sunday school and i collected all the little stickers and put them in my book
7321974 but there are so many christian people i know who are gay and love their religion
7321975 religie heeft niets met compassie en zet aan tot homohaat daarom moet alle religie verboden worden
7321976 i love the idea of the teachings of jesus christ and the beautiful stories about it which i loved in sunday school and i collected all the little stickers and put them in my book
7321977 but there are so many christian people i know who are gay and love their religion
7321978 het onderscheiden van n van de meest gehate mensen van de islamitische wereld geeft de vijandschap van groot brittanni jegens de islam aan
7321979 georganiseerde religie blijkt niet te werken zij verandert mensen in haatdragende kuddedieren
7321980 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been destroyed and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elderly people have died
7321981 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it
7321982 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7321983 what happened a couple weeks ago here should never be repeated
7321984 continuation with the trial of comrade jacob zuma is neither in the interests of our country nor that of justice
7321985 continuation with this case will certainly and unduly raise the political temperature in our country in a manner that can negatively affect the stability of our country and democracy
7321986 the sacp is of the view that without setting any legal or political precedent this case must be reviewed with a view to dropping all the charges against comrade zuma
7321987 to this end an urgent political solution needs to be found in order to arrive at such a conclusion
7321988 in your heart you know race mixing is wrong what are you teaching your children
7321989 im going to spread their contact info to as many people as i know so that they can be bombarded with emails and letters telling them how stupid and ass backwards they are i grabbed the card and stuffed it into bag
7321990 do not give what is holy to dogs and do not throw your pearls before swine
7321991 and why do you look at the speck in your brothers eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly enough to take the speck out of your brothers eye
7321992 and if you brother sins go and reprove him and if he refuses to listen tell it to the church
7321993 i dont want to say this is a good thing even though it is
7321994 could the savior you believe in save osama bin laden
7321995 i really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians the aclu people for the american way all of them who have tried to secularize america i point the finger in their face and say you helped this terrorist attack 9 11 happen

7322000 i want to use the bible alone as our guide it is never worthwhile to give mans opinion the answer to the whole subject can be found in genesis 9 18 27
7322001 a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren
7322002 the true negro does not want integration he realizes his potential is far better among his own race we see the hand of moscow in the background we see the devil himself behind it it will destroy our race eventually in one northern city a pastor friend of mine tells me that a couple of opposite race live next door to his church as man and wife it boils down to whether we are going to take gods word as final
7322003 do you have any african american women doctors in your office
7322004 its our most exciting project to date there are these two characters that are amazing one is modeled after sylvester stallone and the other after a big reality tv star in the united states they go on this awesome adventure and all kinds of exciting things happen and then everything is wrapped up nicely in the end
7322005 those big studio backed films that the festival already seems to be sucking up to in an effort to make sure that everyone from george clooney to angelina jolie to the modern day jerry lewis of the french set michael moore grace the red carpet of the palais and the grand theatre lumiere
7322006 we have standards monsieur and i am sure she used that term loosely
7322007 comments are moderated and will not appear on this weblog until the author has approved them
7322008 how did they let me in here with no security
7322009 inspired by the motion picture theater that magical venue of communion of film lovers the world over
7322010 the movie theater is a building it is above all a space to show films give them the best possible support and put them in relation to each other through programming and discussion sessions
7322011 ik ben het niet met je eens je bent verdwaald en hebt hulp nodig de ware god te vinden discussie blijkt zinloos te zijn dus ik heb andere middelen nodig om dit verloren schaap te bekeren
7322012 a cualquier hora del d a y en cualquier lugar
7322013 la consejer a de la mala educaci n y como se pisan los derechos
7322014 het katholicisme is een heerlijk geloof je misdraagt je biecht het vervolgens op en alles is weer goed een en al vergeving heerlijk
7322015 weet je niet dat dat heel slecht voor je karma is
7322016 nou tegenover elke slechte daad hoort een goede te staan om je karma in evenwicht te houden enkel met een goed karma bereik je eeuwige verlossing van de cirkel van leven en dood zolang je karma slecht is zul je blijven re ncarneren
7322017 dus ik moet niet biechten maar goed doen om vergeven te worden
7322018 shit maar dus als ik nou gewoon een grote som geld doneer aan amnesty of zo dan ben ik weer in balans
7322019 niet als je dat doet voor je eigen karma alleen maar als je het echt vanuit je hart voor anderen doet dus niet uit eigen belang
7322020 maar je mag de bal tijden het voetbalspel toch niet bewust met je handen aanraken
7322021 maar waarom heb je dan een stick bij je weet je zeker dat het voetbal is en geen hockey
7322022 ik heb zon enorme spijt van die moord en die verkrachting vergeef me en me bespaar me de straf
7322023 het is al goed het is je vergeven ga vrij en doe voortaan goed
7322024 gawdamn freddie ray when yew gonna git offa that couch and find a gawdamn job aintchu got no ambition i mean whaddaya fuckin want from this life
7322025 id like another beer and id kinda like to see somethin nekkid
7322026 ik zal mensen maken die mijn evenbeeld zijn die op mij lijken
7322027 en wat dan als je het zus en zo beschouwt
7322028 wat hun overkomen is moet ons tot voorbeeld strekken het is geschreven om ons voor wie de tijd ten einde loopt te waarschuwen
7322029 op velerlei wijzen en langs velerlei wegen heeft god in het verleden tot de voorouders gesproken door de profeten maar nu de tijd ten einde loopt heeft hij tot ons gesproken door zijn zoon die hij heeft aangewezen als enig erfgenaam en door wie hij de wereld heeft geschapen
7322030 ik verzeker jullie sommigen van de hier aanwezigen zullen niet sterven voor ze de komst van de mensenzoon en zijn koninklijke heerschappij hebben meegemaakt
7322031 en wanneer jullie bidden doe dan niet als de huichelaars die graag in de synagoge en op elke straathoek staan te bidden zodat iedereen hen ziet ik verzeker jullie zij hebben hun loon al ontvangen maar als jullie bidden trek je dan in je huis terug sluit de deur en bid tot je vader die in het verborgene is en jullie vader die in het verborgene ziet zal je ervoor belonen
7322032 iedereen die naar een vrouw kijkt en haar begeert heeft in zijn hart al overspel met haar gepleegd
7322033 ik ben de weg en de waarheid en het leven niemand komt tot den vader dan door mij
7322034 rabbi hoe komt het dat hij blind was toen hij geboren werd heeft hij zelf gezondigd of zijn ouders
7322035 de bijbel is toch een boodschap van god de alwetende uit liefde aan ons gegeven
7322036 als we moeten doen wat god zegt dan moeten we de halve wereldebevolking uitroeien volgens dit boek moet iedereen die zijn ouders vervloekt iedereen die overspel pleegt en iedere homoseksueel gedood worden
7322037 bedoel je te zeggen dat de meest intelligente persoon in het heelal ooit van ons verlangd heeft dat we iedere vreemdganger en iedere homoseksueel zouden doden en vervolgens van gedachten veranderde
7322038 hier vertelt de slimste persoon van het universum ons dat slavernij ok is
7322039 kijk hier eens dat is volkomen onge mancipeerd er zijn miljoenen succesvolle leraressen op de wereld en er zijn zelfs directrices of vrouwen met andere gezaghebbende functies ik ken geen enkel intelligent persoon die vindt dat vrouwen zo het zwijgen opgelegd dienen te worden
7322040 tja je moet niet alles letterlijk nemen en niet alles is toepasbaar voor deze tijd god leidt ons ook buiten de bijbel om en uhhh het is ook symboliek zie je nouja sommige dingen dan
7322041 pietje als ik deze bal los laat valt hij naar de grond
7322042 zoals ook eens een dirigent verwijtend tegen ravel zei u begrijpt u eigen muziek niet
7322043 ik weet het toch zeker want prediker bla bla zegt bla bla
7322044 want god had de wereld zo lief dat hij zijn enige zoon heeft gegeven opdat iedereen die in hem gelooft niet verloren gaat maar eeuwig leven heeft
7322045 dit is grote onzin als het christelijke geloof alleen maar een soort van advies was dan heeft het geen belang
7322046 maar in jezelf zul je dit nimmer te nooit vinden en hoewel je heel filosofisch overkomt zul je pas een waar filosoof worden als je niet langer kennis in jezelf zoekt om als god gelijk te worden
7322047 ga het eerst maar eens zelf persoonlijk ervaren dan praten we verder
7322048 waarom dan steeds het wisselvallige en wazige in je houding en mening over jezus ik zal het je nu rechtstreeks op de man af vragen heb je jezus nu wel of niet geaccepteerd als je verlosser en je god dan is dat meteen voor iedereen ook duidelijk want daar draait het om kom uit de kast antoni en geen spelletjes meer je brengt nl iedereen in verwarring en eet van twee walletjes
7322049 er is maar een christen geweest en die is aan het kruis gestorven
7322050 en dat ik echt voor jou hoop dat je hem op een gegeven moment ook zo zult kennen als ik hem ken
7322051 het bloed der martelaren is het zaad van de kerk
7322052 alles waarom jullie in je gebeden vragen zullen jullie krijgen als je maar gelooft
7322053 sia chiaro una volta per tutte non ho nessuna intenzione di rinunciare a la prova del cuoco che stato e resta il mio programma del cuore e perch dovrei poi sono incinta vero ma da quando in qua la gravidanza una malattia
7322054 ich kann ja auch nichts daf r dass ich so sch n bin und jeder kerl auf mich steht
7322055 mein date fand ich bl d er hatte die falschen schuhe an das gefiel mir nicht
7322056 das leben fickt mich jeden tag bin zur zeit nicht erreichbar anscheinend fickt mich der verfuckte tag wieder mal hinterlasst bitte eine nachricht nach dem piep wenn das leben mich nicht mehr durchfickt melde mich mich umgehen zur ck das kann aber dauern
7322057 samenvattend wil je op de nieuwe aarde komen en een hoge functie daarin bekleden dan moet je daar veel voor over hebben wil je gewoon gered of zalig worden dan gaat dat automatisch want god is liefde en genade
7322058 en dit is de getuigenis namelijk dat ons god het eeuwige leven gegeven heeft en ditzelve leven is in zijn zoon die den zoon heeft die heeft het leven die den zoon van god niet heeft die heeft het leven niet deze dingen heb ik u geschreven die gelooft in den naam des zoons van god opdat gij weet dat gij het eeuwige leven hebt en opdat gij gelooft in den naam des zoons van god
7322059 en ik zal u een nieuw hart geven en zal een nieuwen geest geven in het binnenste van u en ik zal het stenen hart uit uw vlees wegnemen en zal u een vlesen hart geven en ik zal mijn geest geven in het binnenste van u en ik zal maken dat gij in mijn inzettingen zult wandelen en mijn rechten zult bewaren en doen
7322060 zo dan indien iemand in christus is die is een nieuw schepsel het oude is voorbijgegaan ziet het is alles nieuw geworden
7322061 want indien wij vijanden zijnde met god verzoend zijn door den dood zijns zoons veel meer zullen wij verzoend zijnde behouden worden door zijn leven
7322062 maar wanneer de goedertierenheid van god onzen zaligmaker en zijn liefde tot de mensen verschenen is heeft hij ons zalig gemaakt niet uit de werken der rechtvaardigheid die wij gedaan hadden maar naar zijn barmhartigheid door het bad der wedergeboorte en vernieuwing des heiligen geestes denwelken hij over ons rijkelijk heeft uitgegoten door jezus christus onzen zaligmaker opdat wij gerechtvaardigd zijnde door zijn genade erfgenamen zouden worden naar de hope des eeuwigen levens
7322063 onderzoekt uzelven of gij in het geloof zijt beproeft uzelven of kent gij uzelven niet dat jezus christus in u is tenzij dat gij enigszins verwerpelijk zijt
7322064 daarom broeders benaarstigt u te meer om uw roeping en verkiezing vast te maken want dat doende zult gij nimmermeer struikelen
7322065 heb jij de 8 stappan al gedaan die ik genoemd hebt in dit logje om in de hemel te komen
7322066 en dit is de getuigenis namelijk dat ons god het eeuwige leven gegeven heeft en ditzelve leven is in zijn zoon die den zoon heeft die heeft het leven die den zoon van god niet heeft die heeft het leven niet deze dingen heb ik u geschreven die gelooft in den naam des zoons van god opdat gij weet dat gij het eeuwige leven hebt en opdat gij gelooft in den naam des zoons van god
7322067 knap dat jij de bijbel kent van a tot z
7322068 zal ik mijn kerk leer gehoorzaam zijn of god gehoorzaam zijn zijn wetboek de bijbel
7322069 zal ik mijn kerk leer gehoorzaam zijn of god gehoorzaam zijn zijn wetboek de bijbel
7322070 jouw echtgenoot is helemaal geen ware liefde want de ware liefde is de dame die hier naast me zit want dat heb ik zelf zo ervaren en dat is de waarheid
7322071 en hij zeide de god onzer vaderen heeft u voorbestemd om zijn wil te leren kennen en de rechtvaardige te zien en een stem uit zijn mond te horen want gij moet getuige voor hem zijn bij alle mensen van hetgeen gij gezien en gehoord hebt
7322072 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause
7322073 have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh
7322074 for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
7322075 our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him

7322082 very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man

7322085 ive always hated when lingerie is uncomfortable so the fit and comfort was key
7322086 papa zei altijd dat rijkdom een zonde was en armoede een straf maar dat god blijkbaar wilde dat er geen enkele relatie was tussen de zonde en de straf de een zondigt en de ander wordt gestraft zo zit de wereld in elkaar

7322095 company works with you you pretty much have a set schedule but have the availability for appointments if any questions you can call your boss if you need an emergency day off you can call your boss or another manager to fill in if you are having problems with a task or a question you can always call another manager to help you and you can call your boss

7322097 sudah biasa seperti itu setiap musim tembakau tapi biarlah mau minta ke siapa lagi kalau bukan ke rakyat kecil seperti kami
7322098 kita sudah tahu sama tahu kok kalau dari segi aturan muatan tembakau kami memang banyak melebihi ketentuan ketimbang ditilang lebih baik kan hilang uang rp10 000 katanya
7322099 kami pasti tindak tegas mereka soalnya itu bukan perintah pimpinan
7322100 tapi perintah yang saya sampaikan maupun pimpinan bukan dengan cara seperti itu pungli tapi langsung ditilang apabila diperkirakan berpotensi menimbulkan kecelakaan lalu lintas

7322104 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7322105 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7322106 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7322107 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7322108 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7322109 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7322110 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want

7322112 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7322113 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7322114 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7322115 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
7322116 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children
7322117 you might think if you were attempting to define public service broadcasting for this modern competitive age that your very starting point would be what can we do to help ensure the continuing breadth of tvs appeal
7322118 with no money to spend they see tv as the primary form of entertainment
7322119 the research found one group of 12 people sharing a house who all congregate around the tv
7322120 london still has to deliver as well as china with regard to the quality of the olympic village venues and transport the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain

7322124 the bottomless pit of enmity and the cavernous morass of malice that i bear towards our wee pravince has not by this time articulated itself to everyone who knows me

7322126 under the new pension credit scheme the department for work and pensions dwp admits that low earners will see their retirement income increased by only 1 per cent of their salary or 2 a week after 10 years saving in the governments flagship new pension scheme to be launched in 2012 because their savings are eaten away by means testing even someone earning 25 000 a year who contributes to the new personal accounts for 20 years will only see their income in retirement increased from 31 per cent of salary to 34 per cent experts say the figures highlight the way pension credit the means tested benefit paid to pensioners with small pensions reduces the incentive for many people to save
7322127 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
7322128 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs
7322129 well be asking two dublin legends where it all went wrong
7322130 west belfasts paddy barnes guaranteed himself a bronze medal after his quarter final triumph in the light flyweight division he now faces chinas zou shiming a home grown favourite and a man who beat paddy in the world championships last year so no surprise to see paddy power offering 9 1 about barnes taking gold and 7 2 to clinch a silver
7322131 people within the party recognise that until the stability of the assembly is more firmly established on a longer term basis there will be reluctance among people who are westminster mps to give up their seats to work exclusively in the assembly there will be a phasing in of that approach
7322132 we have a choice as a people either you continue with the division or you seek to end it my party took the position that in the right circumstances it was possible to proceed but that we couldnt concede to terror criminal activities had to end guns had to be handed over and there had be support for the police the courts and the rule of law
7322133 while political parties in ni would have wide areas where they can agree if you put the conservative party and the labour party into the same room you would have battles every day on issues of socio economic policy
7322134 the differences we have we are talking about and attempting to reach agreement on there are battles but they are ending without blood being spilt and that perhaps is the difference between now and the past
7322135 protecting national security preventing violence and maintaining the existing social and political order
7322136 it was bad enough that the u s mint branded us as criminals for exercising our right to freely exchange the private gold and silver currency
7322137 but interfering with ron pauls presidential campaign is clearly a gestapo tactic
7322138 without the misleading depictions of the size weight and color ther e is no probable cause for issuance of the warrants
7322139 the us dollar has lost over 50 of its value in the last ten years while the liberty dollar has appreciated by 500 would you rather make five times your money or lose half of it i think the government is trying to crush our inflation proof currency plus ron pauls free market and peace campaign in a single stroke
7322140 what have you ordered from the liberty dollar in the last month

7322165 nbc did not mention mitchams orientation nor did they show his family and partner who were in the stands nbc has made athletes significant others a part of the coverage in the past choosing to spotlight track athlete sanya richards fiancee a love triangle between french and italian swimmers and kerri walshs wedding ring debacle
7322166 its not part of the story hes just an athlete
7322167 now problem have a smile on your face and have a nice day
7322168 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
7322169 why ants dont get into traffic jams and humans do
7322170 if you move over too soon you have this big empty piece of real estate which could absorb that many more cars
7322171 its a matter of theres no violation no one is being injured ergo chill out enjoy life youre spending too much energy pounding the dashboard
7322172 when im plainclothes people cut me off all the time
7322173 my thought is if you knew who i am you probably wouldnt do that
7322174 in the overall scheme of things its a very short amount of time
7322175 i would say well the lane was open and i took it
7322176 but i dont have to let him in do i
7322177 decisero di non cedere le armi preferirono combattere e morire per la patria tennero fede al giuramento questa signor presidente della repubblica ellenica lessenza della vicenda di cefalonia nel settembre del 1943
7322178 when i first met him he was pretty unhappy he wasnt liking the diving in brisbane at all he didnt want to do it wasnt happy being there
7322179 we cant afford for lachlan to go at the moment
7322180 but johnson amp johnson offer grants to go to beijing and ive nominated lachlan as the support person i want to go
7322181 it would have been impossible and i probably wouldnt have made it without their help
7322182 when i was whizzing around the sky is the same colour as the water i was freaking out it was the first time i had dived outside since i left the sport
7322183 it was a break for me to explore myself and get familiar with who i really was and to be happy with who i really was just being a happier person really radiates into other areas of your life
7322184 at the same time i was applying for the nsw institute of sport to try and get into the diving squad it was a good warm up i was doing similar dives and getting my head around all of the movements again it was a pretty smooth lead into intense training again
7322185 i probably wouldnt have as much of a fighting spirit
7322186 the more you have experienced the more you have to draw off i look at the last 20 years as a long winding path of lessons and some hardship i hope the rest of my life isnt straight because that could be boring
7322187 the bullets came from all directions from the right and the left meanwhile i was crying out to god to send his angels to protect us and i saw the young people falling injured all around me and others managed to run for their lives
7322188 we are sure that the soldiers were guarding the killers or maybe they came with them so that the police would not be able to intervene they had to have known what was going on because they passed right in front of the center
7322189 his head was very bad his body was covered with blood i got close to him but he no longer had any reaction he stayed there a long time they were going to take him to a clinic but they never made it and they left him there
7322190 all we do is detox counseling we try to get people jobs
7322191 we have scheduled a special session friday to update the nec on the status of negotiations
7322192 any speculation to the contrary of greenwalts statement is absolutely false
7322193 our lack of pursuing adequate minimums has caught up to us
7322194 if you reach for the stars you might hit the top of the mountain if you go in as aftra does and reach for the top of the hill and you get it and say oh look we got it youve failed even if the raises keep up with inflation you havent made it one step further
7322195 theyve got nowhere to go theres no plan b theres no plan at anytime they are the ones that enabled this to happen they have no leg to stand on there never is one you ask them what the plan is and they say aftra sucks okay fine tell me what the plan is
7322196 theres a difference between freedom of speech and using union resources to undermine another unions operation its one legal battle id be pretty interested to see play out
7322197 the new york board is on the record objecting to this official interference in the internal processes of another union that unfortunately is what these recorded messages represent
7322198 as reaffirmed by screen actors guilds board of directors at its march 29 2008 meeting sag national president alan rosenberg and national executive director doug allen and their specific designees are the only official guild spokespersons regarding the guilds negotiations
7322199 the law is straightforward union officials bear a heavy burden to justify why they would restrain members to communicate opinions about matters on which they are to vote
7322200 some individuals allege that the landrum griffin act requires screen actors guild to permit guild officers to use guild resources including our email systems to send messages in opposition to the guilds officially and democratically approved position on the aftra contract ratification vote to the contrary it is well established law that the landrum griffin act protects members in their exercise of their free speech rights and does not apply to officers when they seek to use union resources they may have access to in that capacity to counteract the unions own initiatives emphasis
7322201 freed is both an officer and a member here he is trying to exercise his right as a member federal courts have held that members whose views are opposed to the unions should have an opportunity to present their views to other members of the union in other words sag is not allowed to discriminate against freed simply because he is also an officer

7322205 felipe ha fatto un weekend straordinario ieri e stato velocissimo in qualifica e oggi ha guidato in maniera impeccabile senza sbagliare nulla e ha conquistato un successo meritatissimo dopo la delusione di budapest voglio fare i complimenti a lui e a tutta la squadra che ha lavorato con grande impegno nella preparazione di questo appuntamento purtroppo ancora una volta abbiamo avuto un problema di affidabilita stavolta sulla macchina di kimi che ci e costato dei punti preziosissimi ora dobbiamo capire le cause che hanno determinato questo nuovo cedimento del motore e vedere come reagire e chiaro che quanto e successo e grave e dovremo fare di tutto per recuperare nelle prossime corse il terreno perduto per i problemi di affidabilita ora dobbiamo continuare a spingere per sviluppare la vettura e migliorare laffidabilita al fine di prepararci nella maniera migliore per le prossime gare ci restano due sessioni di prove a monza e poi a jerez e tanti giorni di intenso lavoro in fabbrica infine vorrei spendere qualche parola per pietro timpini il nostro meccanico rimasto infortunato in occasione del secondo pit stop di kimi le sue prime parole quando ci ho parlato sono state di scuse come se lincidente fosse stato colpa sua e grazie alla passione alla dedizione e alla professionalita che questi ragazzi dimostrano quotidianamente per la ferrari che la nostra squadra e cosi speciale
7322206 e fantastico aver vinto questa corsa soprattutto dopo la delusione di budapest la squadra ha fatto una lavoro straordinario nella preparazione di questo gran premio e i frutti si sono visti sin dalla prima giornata ieri e arrivata la pole oggi la vittoria con la ciliegina sulla torta del giro piu veloce non si puo chiedere di piu in particolare dal mio centesimo gran premio di una carriera tutta fatta con i motori ferrari ho fatto una bella partenza e ho spinto al massimo sin dai primi giri nella seconda porzione di gara la macchina era eccezionale ma anche nellultima quando avevo le gomme piu morbide i tempi arrivavano con facilita questo e un momento importante nella mia carriera e devo continuare a lavorare in questo modo mi dispiace per quello che e successo a kimi dobbiamo fare molta attenzione allaffidabilita sono sicuro che la squadra sapra trovare le giuste contromisure per reagire su questo fronte come ha sempre fatto in passato
7322207 ce poco da dire al termine di una giornata come questa non e stato certo il weekend che speravo di avere ma nonostante questo risultato negativo non credo di essere tagliato fuori dalla lotta per il titolo ci sono ancora sei gare da disputare e sessanta punti in palio abbiamo visto che le cose possono cambiare in fretta anche se mi rendo conto che la situazione si e fatta piu complicata oggi ho perso una posizione alla partenza e sono stato nel traffico per tutta la prima parte poi quando ho avuto la pista libera ho potuto spingere e giravo su buoni tempi in occasione del secondo pit stop ho commesso un errore e sono partito prima del dovuto fortunatamente pietro timpini n d r non si e fatto troppo male gli faccio i miei auguri e spero che si rimetta presto in ogni caso non sarebbe cambiato nulla perch poi ha ceduto il motore ora dobbiamo concentrarci sulla preparazione dei prossimi appuntamenti e sul miglioramento della prestazione in qualifica
7322208 bellissima la prestazione di felipe in tutto il fine settimana e stato fantastico e a lui vanno fatti tanti complimenti purtroppo non siamo stati ancora una volta affidabili sia dal punto di vista tecnico che da quello delle operazioni in pista considerato quello che e accaduto in occasione del pit stop di kimi e del successivo cedimento del suo propulsore la cui causa sembra essere ad una prima analisi simile a quella verificatisi in ungheria sulla macchina di felipe fortunatamente pietro timpini il meccanico addetto al rifornimento infortunatosi in occasione del secondo pit stop di raikkonen ha riportato solamente una piccola frattura al piede sinistro nulla di particolarmente grave oggi abbiamo avuto una doppia conferma abbiamo un grande potenziale come squadra e come macchina in grado di farci stare davanti a tutti ma se non abbiamo il rendimento ottimale di tutte le componenti allora lasciamo per strada dei punti preziosi che ci possono costare cari dobbiamo lavorare per cercare di porre rimedio a questi problemi ed e quello che continueremo a fare sin dai prossimi giorni

7322244 and besides we got to hobnob with the elite of a cyclo was a pedal bike with a seat for two attached to the front it was a form of transport neither of us had sampled but the experience turned out to be a good one to be among the thick of famous for its limestone mountains jutting out from the sea the journey took three hours but the time passed quickly the scenery outside was the they sell land to japanese but the government pay farmer for his paddy fields he get lot of money and he is very happy he buy big house
7322245 but farmer is uneducated man he soon spend all money and he has no way of feeding family now his land is gone he cannot sell his rice he become very poor man this farmer and lots of others like him are now big problem for my government
7322246 then sell them as you can see some have been bought and completed

7322257 over het geloof in god het volgen van jezus en het leven door de geest
7322258 maar dit geldt niet voor mij want ik weet niet of ik dit wel geloof
7322259 de catechese thuis en in de kerk is de weg waarlangs god de werkelijkheid van onze doop tot echt ervaarbare werkelijkheid wil maken catechese is ten principale doopcatechese
7322260 het besef van de grote trouw van god die door de generaties heen gaat dat kweekte een grote liefde voor de jongeren van de gemeente
7322261 alle catechetisch leren gaat uit van de doop en is daarop gericht
7322262 de hele gemeente is geroepen blijvend een lerende gemeenschap te zijn
7322263 geloofsoverdracht een kernwoord uit de catechese begint niet met de catechese het begint thuis in de opvoeding maar is eveneens een wezenlijk onderdeel van de gemeente
7322264 in de omgang met jongeren ontdek je iets van de landingsbaan van het evangelie
7322265 hoe krijg je dit goed tussen de oren en in het hart
7322266 daarom zal de catechese continu bezig moeten zijn met de toe eigening van wat we in christus hebben te leven vanuit het gestorven zijn met christus om van nu voortaan voor hem te leven dat nieuwe leven is niet automatisch met de doop gegeven het is de vraag hoe je hen in iedere levensfase leert een kind van god zijn en alles wat daarbij hoort zich eigen te maken

7322268 pai am deja 28 de ani o sa intelegi si tu cand o sa ai varsta mea
7322269 i think its exceedingly important that we dont look at the success here as a moment in time
7322270 because if we dont carry on from what we accomplished here and build we will have done a disservice to olympians in the future
7322271 we are playing with the big boys when we come to the olympics especially the summer olympics and the 205 countries that are here
7322272 weve gotten a little better but were going to need more money if we are going to make that climb
7322273 i go through these emotionally i am a canadian too
7322274 my heart broke for marie helene premont who didnt finish at the bike and you cant imagine what we felt for adam in his first race knowing the intensity he brings to what he does
7322275 there were many of those moments but there were many of the eric lamaze gold and silver in equestrian moments and alex despatie who won silver
7322276 im no longer saying fourth we almost had a medal
7322277 im saying silver what could we have done to have the gold if you start thinking that way it pulls the system up
7322278 im back to training im doing some muay thai and jiu jitsu stuff and thanks god everything is fine now ill be back in december they said that i might fight with quinton jackson but nothing has been signed yet they ufc called me and offered a fight with him and i accepted but they didnt say anything else more
7322279 it surely can be a problem but i want him back in december and against me and i believe he can be back
7322280 we have just started the season and had a very difficult game last saturday
7322281 everybody has discounted us at the moment but one more player will not make a big difference for us
7322282 for me what is very important is to start the season well by qualifying for the champions league and winning our first few games then if we need an addition we can still do it
7322283 it doesnt take any special pressure off us because i feel we have to win trophies the pressure is exactly the same for me we are here to win the trophy
7322284 however i think there is more to come from my team this season we have a structure in the team and a way of playing that is very efficient we have mastered that well so i do not see why we should not set ourselves high targets
7322285 silvestre has a little knock and i dont think he will be involved over the weekend but alex song has returned and should be available after the olympics philippe senderos has an inflammation with his back he should return soon maybe not on saturday but on wednesday samir nasri is likely to come back in for fulham he missed the international in midweek because they did not want to take a gamble on a friendly game and i feel they made the right decision
7322286 they look much more dangerous going forward than last year and its a derby too
7322287 for me our success in this game will be based upon how quickly we can focus again after international matches
7322288 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7322289 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7322290 i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7322291 it was a good effort but all credit to darren
7322292 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance
7322293 how can we demonstrate that our new crm system is providing value to the firm
7322294 i dont want to pre empt it but we do know that its not getting any cheaper to participate in the olympics if you fund at the same level you move backwards
7322295 we have got the formula right but lets look at how it can be honed even further
7322296 of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity
7322297 if we stay still we will get further behind in our review we have to look for another edge
7322298 doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
7322299 het leek me leuk in het oosten van het land te gaan wonen dus heb ik dat maar gedaan
7322300 now i know them i hope we stay in contact it is one thing to read about them and to write to them but to go and meet them in person is something else
7322301 if something happens and they suddenly need a sports person from another sport or from another culture i would certainly try to be as available as i possibly could for them
7322302 for london they want to focus more on the sport side of things to go there and actually be a part of the sport
7322303 they dont see any reason why they cant especially with the games now not being involved with china
7322304 the main reason they formed team tibet was as a bit of motivation for the refugees around the world
7322305 assess the actual situation in tibet and let the world know the truth
7322306 cheers to your blog for supporting healthy oceans and the alaskan brewing company
7322307 mira que asco da esto que te estoy metiendo delante de la cara
7322308 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7322309 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective has demonstrated is a winning combination
7322310 like care for working families and the poor and foreign policy premised on peace over war
7322311 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7322312 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7322313 separate themselves from communion with the church and should not present themselves for the eucharist
7322314 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7322315 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7322316 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7322317 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down

7322329 es una locura est n firmando que la migraci n irregular es un delito cuando debe ser una irregularidad administrativa esto viola los derechos humanos
7322330 rechazaron en la ltima cumbre en tucum n que los pa ses adopten medidas severamente restrictivas el migrar el no migrar y el retorno son derechos humanos reconocidos por la comunidad internacional nos preocupa y apena como pa s de destino que somos en los viejos tiempos de europeos y en la actualidad de pa ses lim trofes

7322348 i would like to appeal for calm in the sense that a life has been wasted and if there is tension within the community then people need to talk to the police
7322349 we are aware of gang rivalries when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm
7322350 we are very much alive to the intelligence that comes from the community itself and we have put extra resources on the ground we have put on high visibility patrols and that does include armed patrols
7322351 this type of crime does remain rare in terms of gun crime in birmingham one murder is one murder too many and we will pull out all the stops to bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion

7322355 become fashionable to view russias involvement in south ossetia through the prism of the cold war with the 1968 soviet invasion of czechoslovakia as the blueprint but such interpretations are historical folly
7322356 let us be clear russias involvement in south ossetia is not about ideology nor is it about regime change in georgia least of all is it about re establishing the boundaries of the u s s r it is about restoring a fragile peace
7322357 while its move into south ossetia was triggered by the reckless and brutal actions of georgian president mikheil saakashvili its real target was washington and the growing american presence along russias borders the united states plans to bring georgia and ukraine into nato and to build a missile defense system in central europe have pushed russia to go beyond ineffective protests and take action
7322358 it began not on aug 8 but in july with a vast military exercise caucasus 2008 as dress rehearsal for the invasion as a flanking maneuver moscow handed out thousands of passports to south ossetians legally georgians to have a nice pr gambit ready what aggressors us we are just protecting the motherlands citizens so here we are at the fourth russian conquest of georgia
7322359 the problem is that putin still fully in charge in moscow in his new position is not only aware of the potential costs of his actions he is also willing to pay them if need be putin recognizes the importance of economic factors in todays world and he is committed to building russias economic strength but it is a means to an end strategic security that he will not sacrifice at any price
7322360 personally i would like him to be around and see us flourish and make pakistan a success story i think that would be the revenge of benazir bhutto
7322361 yes this is going to be the best for everyone not just for my ego

7322368 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7322369 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7322370 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable

7322384 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7322385 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7322386 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7322387 there is the possibility of street flooding the next couple of days
7322388 we could see some areas flood especially low lying areas
7322389 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7322390 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7322391 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve go problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
7322392 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
7322393 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
7322394 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
7322395 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
7322396 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
7322397 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
7322398 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
7322399 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
7322400 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
7322401 theres lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
7322402 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
7322403 the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it because it is not weaned national parks and wildlife regional manager chris mcintosh told abc radio
7322404 they saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route
7322405 the diners were at first quite curious and then someone alerted the coastal authorities
7322406 im sure he would love it im sure he will be watching over us
7322407 on sunday you can run for local fallen soldiers we are running from the big rapids armory to the hemlock park
7322408 at the end of the run there will be a barbecue for anyone who wants to support fallen soldiers and their families
7322409 when you request a permanent charter typically the american legion asks that you name the post after a former member killed action
7322410 the descendants approval must be on file and we are seeking their relatives
7322411 my understanding is that chapmans family departed the island after their son was killed
7322412 they may be somewhere in the southern part of the state chapman died in world war ii just prior to ve day damkowski was killed in vietnam the dankowskis may be in the northern lower peninsula but we dont know who still survives
7322413 we want to honor these gentlemen for their sacrifice and their families should be very proud and happy
7322414 we want to invite the family to the island for the dedication we may even include all three names in the post charter but we still need approval from the families to do that
7322415 right now weve sent reconnaissance teams to ten different counties and have additional forces standing by in north florida
7322416 there are another 14 or so counties that may need assistance as this storm pases westward across the state we are well prepared to assist in any high water vehicle missions especially search and rescue and area assistance survey work we work well with our local county and municipal partners and are ready to help them in any way we can
7322417 were maintaining the whole warehouse and just pretty much waiting for the storm
7322418 we have all the trucks stocked and are making sure everything is ready to go
7322419 the rern system gives the state the ability to rapidlydeploy6 a communications network anywhere if the
7322420 and this gives the commanders on the ground the ability to run their operations and get assets out to the people who need them quickly
7322421 this is a very odd storm in the sense that it is moving so slowly and it has zig zagged across the state
7322422 this is a storm that has had the unique potential to make landfall five times thats not happened before
7322423 similar to general relativity where time and space are curved transformation optics shows that the space for light can also be bent in an almost arbitrary way
7322424 if youre out on the battlefield and you see a cloud coming or you suspect there might be an aerosol chemical or biological warfare being used against you its very difficult to quickly detect what the material is
7322425 so this would be an enormous improvement and not just on the battlefield but it would allow us to make all kinds of materials what we call nanomanufacturing
7322426 which could go into electronic and optical devices that youd use from night vision goggles to distance sensors to other kinds of sensors
7322427 one of the most exciting applications is an electromagnetic cload that can bend light around itself similar to the flow of water around a stone
7322428 making invisible both the cloak and an object hidden inside
7322429 this experiment was performed in 2006 and it was almost like a chairn reaction
7322430 the field of transformation optics and meta materials and negative index materials exploded with this but as i say the proof of principle has a long way to go before we can see that on the battlefield
7322431 one can assume that the front six tentacles have the function of arms and that the back two take over the function of legs
7322432 people have always assumed that octopuses coordinate their gripping behavior throught visual data that seems to be true when one eye is weak another side of arms is favored
7322433 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
7322434 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked a large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
7322435 the five days of the reunion arent why we are here probably its more the week or two weeks ahead of the reunion when we all get together socialize do things together work on projects together
7322436 that time means more to me than the actual reunion time but its still all about putting a show on for the public that is why we do what we do
7322437 when it began in 1950 they wanted to bring people together that recalled the golden age of harvesting they wanted to reminisce about the 20s and 30s and the tough times they had through the depression and the great times they had harvesting
7322438 for the new generation of people the show has had to modify itself slightly to remain interesting and attractive to todays visitors quite honestly some of the people who walk through the gates of old threshers have no idea what they are looking at it gives you the opportunity to learn about the machines that are a part of our agriculture history
7322439 some of them work more than a month and a half and stay in their campers because they love doing what they do
7322440 what they do gives them a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction in a job well done and they get to see their friends because these people all become friends and you can see it every year when they begin to arrive
7322441 each engine has its own bit of history of what it did in its past life
7322442 we dont take and stay out here and bust our butts the whole time we socialize we go out to eat together have cookouts together have a pot luck and ice cream night
7322443 we are getting some younger people involved in it old threshers some peoples kids or grandkids are getting involved in it there is nothing computerized about any of this it doesnt grab the attention of the kids like animated things you see on tv or the computer games do you know
7322444 that was a big gut check for this place a big gut check because were in southeast iowa in the middle of what we consider agricultural america so now we have to say wait a minute who am i marketing to out there who are we looking at so it changed how we did things it changed our perspective and it gave us a better understanding of what needs to occur
7322445 if you plan for a smaller crowd that is what you are going to get we always plan for one of the biggest crowds weve ever had we are preparing for one of the best shows we have ever put on
7322446 i honestly believe that at the first weekend of old threshers
7322447 this meeting will be dedicated to the georgian crisis notably to what positions the european union intends adopting covering aid for georgia and future relations with russia
7322448 were the men and women who cover politics in washington and were disappearing fast
7322449 so if they should have the need to evacuate city for a weather related or terrorist or any other situation they needed to have a program or a plan in place for sheltering the folks during part of the evacuation and obviously along with sheltering comes feeding
7322450 id love to have children with nicolas i hope to if i am young enough it would be a dream
7322451 im not pregnant and i regret it because i love it when i am will it happen it is very difficult for me to say however it is more difficult when you are 40 than when you are 25
7322452 american people where obama comes from and what his vision is for the country
7322453 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7322454 it doesnt matter who we pick there isnt going to be any footage or any video of john mccains running mate saying that they would be honored to support barack obama for president because the country would be better off
7322455 years of relentless preparation have earned the canadian olympic team members this great opportunity to compete in the worlds most prestigious sporting competition
7322456 as our sport ambassadors they have brought our country tremendous pride and honour
7322457 on behalf of the government of canada i congratulate our athletes and coaches canadas team delivered many outstanding inspiring performances
7322458 good luck to our paralympic athletes who will soon compete at the paralympic summer games

7322462 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7322463 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7322464 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7322465 they didnt tell us there were going to be 600 people here

7322470 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7322471 its much much safer for the officers and the subject
7322472 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7322473 if that is how they deal with family problems how are they dealing with the public
7322474 to have 69 complaints and only a few sustained that is reflective of successful use
7322475 his wife ran outside screaming nooo nooooo seeing her husband bleeding and rolling in the glass as the officer continued to manhandle him
7322476 it makes me wonder whether they really looked at what happened
7322477 i cant believe that this is how they want officers to use their taser
7322478 officer medrano took the womans keys and returned to her medranos car
7322479 at the time of the incident the woman was unarmed and you used unsound judgment by threatening to use deadly force without sufficient cause to believe you were in danger of serious bodily injury or death
7322480 short of deadly force tasers are the most scrutinized tool in the department
7322481 es extremadamente dif cil saber con certeza cu ntas personas han quedado atrapadas en la avalancha
7322482 if you have a ticket for yesterday we will refund it
7322483 the air supply system has to work very very hard
7322484 it loses more air out of the system so its unfair to blame the valve its the air system it needs to be replaced
7322485 that is the fastest way to get people to the station
7322486 i share unreservedly the belief that russia is deliberately undertaking a dangerous threatening imperial expansion in the
7322487 education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity
7322488 es extremadamente dif cil saber con certeza cu ntas personas han quedado atrapadas en la avalancha
7322489 i definitely want to get something bad on the road it must be big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about

7322504 i just loved it i enjoyed it 100 lots of duels lots of energy
7322505 ive got to be honest i signed two days ago trained once and today i played and didnt know their names
7322506 during the game i learned their names learned how everyone plays
7322507 it was a lot of fun i wanted to play an intelligent game and try to do my best for the team
7322508 i loved it in midfield but a job had to be done in defence
7322509 ive asked them for their verbal reaction after the game and not one of them can really hold up their hands and say they have performed
7322510 robert green made a couple of saves and for the first 10 minutes we got into a couple of dangerous areas but it fizzled out
7322511 after that it was man city mainly who were the driving force
7322512 i was hoping to get to half time either to make some changes or try and affect it somewhere but the sending off came along and i dont think were equipped to play with 10 men at the moment
7322513 at first i thought it was quite harsh obviously the handball was deliberate but that was the first challenge that he made and i couldnt quite see it

7322531 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem
7322532 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7322533 there has to be what you would describe as reasonable grounds for being absent
7322534 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7322535 its part of our approach of mutual responsibility and we think it is an important way to go because its those kids who miss out from regular school attendance who are going to be the most vulnerable across the entire country

7322537 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem

7322541 it has been absolutely fantastic the biggest parade we have ever had
7322542 there were people lining the whole route to cheer the floats on from all over society
7322543 i would say now its not just a gay parade its a true manchester parade and we are really proud of that its grown tremendously from when it started as a bring and buy outside a pub just look at it now
7322544 it has been a fantastic day with so many nationalities and generations present it felt quite exhilarating being there with people expressing such pride about who they were
7322545 i loved the music each float played on their journey through manchester pink abba kylie songs from musicals like hairspray it created a great vibe throughout deansgate
7322546 this is my first pride event and to be part of the biggest ever police contingent is amazing
7322547 i think its fantastic to see how gmp supports its lesbian and gay officers
7322548 its the first year we have decided to come down to watch the parade and its just been brilliant the children have really enjoyed it and theres been so much to see its been a great day for all the family
7322549 today was a celebration and a show of national pride that the olympics is coming to the uk in four years time
7322550 i think we should all be celebrating its fantastic that the games are coming to the uk
7322551 we wanted as many people as possible to join in the handover celebrations
7322552 considering the number of kids we lost im a little shocked
7322553 i think thats the reason why were ranked high respect
7322554 respect to the program our tradition and where weve been its not based on what we have coming back
7322555 im a little shocked that we were ranked that high but im not shocked at where katy and carroll are ranked theyre good football teams
7322556 rankings are good for reading and speculation but itll all be decided on the football field
7322557 were a notoriously slow starting team but its not how you start but its how you finish

7322562 understand exactly what is cover ed and how often youll use it and what your return on your annual investment will be
7322563 it depends on the condition of your vehicle its certainly possible you have one of those roadside assistance plans for 20 years and you never use it
7322564 if you drive an older vehicle then you certainly can end up getting your moneys worth
7322565 its often a perk with the sale of a new vehicle and its often the first year or x number of miles

7322571 i had a different role when i started playing international cricket batting at a different slot we had players to play long innings but i was one of those to go out and accelerate and even if i got out it was okay there was a transformation and in the last two years ive been under a little pressure to be more responsible thats what im doing and ive got a strike rate of nearly 90
7322572 we have asked the icc in the tele conference for a checklist of security to be provided so that we could assess it during the home series against india in january 2009
7322573 what we now want is a comprehensive things to do list from the icc so that we could implement those measures in the series against india
7322574 when suicide bombings happen in pakistan of course those who live thousands of miles away from our country have fears but even the icc security team in charge had said the suicide bombings had nothing to do with cricket we had told the countries to send their representatives and make their own security assessments but unfortunately they had their reservations
7322575 not just us but india had also decided not to take part had the event been relocated

7322617 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7322618 what was most galling was that there was nothing i could do this cruel disease takes its own course

7322623 her grandfather was a magic user could she be fae
7322624 it wouldnt matter anyway lycanthropy would kill all but a handful of fae species the blood of tribes strong enough to survive an attack would drive out the magic
7322625 a few hours possibly but not three days the fairie blood were talking about would make short work of the wolf

7322647 last february in whitby ontario dave earnestly contended for the faith by participating in three debates held at the annual toronto skeptics conference moderated this year by a popular catholic media personality
7322648 and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ
7322649 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good
7322650 im only going to say this once she should not drive either
7322651 im not saying its true but i think people should know about it
7322652 i have decided i can no longer be a registered republican for the first time in my life i announced my support for a democratic candidate for the presidency in february of this year this was not an endorsement of the democratic platform nor was it a slap in the face to the republican party my decision came at the end of last week when it was demonstrated to the nation that mccain and this bush white house have learned little in the last five years they mishandled what became a crisis in the caucusus and this has undermined u s national security at the same time the mccain camp appears to be comfortable with running an unworthy karl rove style political campaign will the mccain operation and its sponsors do anything to win this week i changed my registration from republican to independent
7322653 this move is certainly one of the more brazen attempts to lock me out of the political process
7322654 i challenge senator mccain to forcefully and publicly instruct his agents to drop the lawsuit
7322655 lets not have the kind of stalinist politics that the state of new york the republican party has been practicing
7322656 the mccains increased their budget for household employees from 184 000 in 2006 to 273 000 in 2007 according to john mccains tax returns
7322657 you believe that there is one god you do well even the demons believe and tremble
7322658 i dont know how jeff immelt can be any clearer on this
7322659 sale talk is just silly speculation and has no basis in truth hopefully this will lay that silly speculation to rest
7322660 i think theres a better feeling about nbc than we have seen for years we have advertisers who were delivered far more ratings points than they imagined or than we promised and morale in the company is very high
7322661 what this proves is that the pipes still work if you put on programming thats compelling enough for the audience theyll show up
7322662 ive been to just about every major sporting event of the last 20 years and this was as exciting a moment as ive ever seen
7322663 we did have a lot riding on this financially and professionally and emotionally
7322664 nbc universal has never looked this good never felt so strong
7322665 know you have the deep deep gratitude of an entire company
7322666 online programming of the games in no way cannibalised network television and probably helped drive viewership on air
7322667 ultimately these programmes have to live or die on their own
7322668 mediocrity wont work on network television it has to be compelling
7322669 nellestate mi sembra del 72 certe donne hanno cominciato a portare gli zoccoli olandesi quelli bianchi erano stati in olanda non lo so per un paio di anni dopo gi non cerano altro che imitazioni il tacco pi alto delle orribili borchie di metallo invece erano belli quelli neri semplici un po consumati li portavano ragazzi con capelli lunghi e biondi sciolti sul pool over pantaloni blu a tubo e calzettoni rossi ora li vedo solo per sono modelli pi nuovi quando vado davanti agli asili lei ci va mai davanti agli asili
7322670 ci vada c questatmosfera e queste meravigliose mamme italiane che aspettano luscita dei bambini si sacrificano per loro e poi quando i figli diventeranno grandi allora andranno dai professori per chiedere come va attilio e federica vengono da me lo sa
7322671 io so che lei qui da unora e ancora non mi ha detto niente mi parla di scarpe di asili di mamme dellestate del millenovecentosettantadue e magari ora mi far la storia della sua generazione
7322672 non si preoccupi io mica lo so cos la mia generazione so solo che cera ignazio maria io cero anchio e stavamo ancora a casa coi nostri genitori un anno nevicato un altranno sembrava dovesse esserci un colpo di stato a un certo punto andavamo tutti era destate andavamo tutti in portogallo non mi ricordo pi perch s per andare a vedere un colonnello si chiamava otello di carvajo chi era
7322673 senta non mi faccia perder la pazienza io non c voglio ancora credere diciamo che io spero che lei stamattina si sia svegliato con la voglia di fare uno scherzo alla polizia mi segue
7322674 l sopra c un via vai continuo troppa gente che passa mi da fastidio
7322675 a me invece piace vedere la gente per esempio la gente che guarda le vetrine di sabato io faccio su e gi con le scale mobili dei grandi magazzini quante persone che faticano per stare al passo coi tempi per essere moderne segretarie bancari casalinghe tutta gente normale sempre presa in giro perch fa una vita non eccitante
7322676 ha presente quelle scarpe basse le spadrillas quelle senza lacci per ecco ora diventato un fatto normale invece anni fa cerano alcune ragazze che le portavano scalcagnate dietro quasi a pantofola ecco questo fatto mi infastidiva senso di sporcizia di sfacciataggine ma insieme quanto mi eccitava ma la posso aprire quella teda
7322677 ecco che le dicevo ogni scarpa una camminata ogni camminata una diversa concezione del mondo comunque volete stare comodo a casa vostra

7322689 a nuestro amigo secretario general de la oea jos miguel insulza le queremos decir con todo respeto que el proceso electoral en nicaragua lo decidimos los nicarag enses y que si eso nos tiene que llevar a retirarnos de ese instrumento del imperio estadounidense y las oligarqu as pues primero nos retiramos de la oea antes que aceptar las imposiciones

7322691 i will commit to this team until i cant walk no more
7322692 to win another one lisa leslie got four and she wore all four to the game tonight i want to catch lisa i want to catch michael phelps
7322693 im just so excited about how many want to go forward
7322694 i know we have a lot of great young talent in the nba that will probably be on the 2012 team im more than committed to being on this team again
7322695 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7322696 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7322697 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7322698 the young guys coming up that want to be a part of this make sure you have right mindset
7322699 thats be unselfish with everything its not about you shining its about the team shining
7322700 they had a bad start before they left for athens in 2004 but with lebron and those guys coming back for this and telling everyone how cool it is its going to be a hot ticket theres going to be a lot of competition to play for this team
7322701 now the world stage is going to be lifted because the world sees we are taking everything seriously
7322702 so that playing for the united states in the olympics becomes the thing they really want to do
7322703 ive got a couple of letters from penn state pitt oregon boston college and wisconsin
7322704 i dont really have any favorites at this point though
7322705 i would say i probably grew up mostly a fan of penn state theyre just close to home when i make my decision the biggest factors will probably be playing time and whether i can stay close to home
7322706 i learned a lot from the coach there he was mostly with other coaches so i didnt really get a chance to talk to him but i learned a lot from him

7322819 when prices were good i was able to build a house i got a wife and i was able to raise my family
7322820 then the buyers started dropping prices i was facing losses in terms of what i had invested in the farm in buying fertilizers pesticides seeds and labour i could not recover
7322821 in those days french beans would give you a good pay people were planting french beans all over
7322822 but the prices are preventing us from farming french beans they are getting lower and lower farmers are running into debt
7322823 prices were bad the whole of last year 60 percent of our production was not bought and we fed the cows with it
7322824 it has become more and more of a challenge to address all this the fuel prices the cost of inputs has gone up and at the same time there is a lot of competition from other countries
7322825 kenya strayed from sustainable farming and followed the temptation of exporting when its clearly preferable to produce and consume locally
7322826 with subsistence farming theres more or less always a market for your products but when french or european retailers no longer want beans then kenya will be left with nothing
7322827 kenya can try to cash in on exports to neighbouring countries but exports to europe are a lost cause due to the soaring cost of transport the issue of carbon emissions farmers should not waste time in shifting the focus back to indigenous crops
7322828 encouraging subsistence farming is another way of taking kenyan farmers out of the international market chain and confining them to poverty
7322829 african countries will not become food secure by having enough food in their granary but by having enough disposable income in their pockets to buy the food they need

7323040 its a growing concern and its clearly one of the largest concerns people have
7323041 what we are experiencing is a demand shock coming from a new category of participant in the commodities futures markets
7323042 for 150 years people who are not commercial traders had no business being in the futures markets
7323043 to my sense there has to be a clear distinction between those who can legitimately trade and those who should not be trading
7323044 lets not make any accusations until we have some information
7323045 if there is found to be some forces other than market forces at work lets have a discussion about that but lets not put the cart before the horse
7323046 american people where obama comes from and what his vision is for the country
7323047 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7323048 it doesnt matter who we pick there isnt going to be any footage or any video of john mccains running mate saying that they would be honored to support barack obama for president because the country would be better off
7323049 why are you releasing these bloody georgians if they dont release my husband who is held hostage there
7323050 i know that it is very difficult for people in this village to accept that those two prisoners have been released
7323051 i respect their reactions but i am convinced that this is a way to secure that those people missing from this village come back as soon as possible
7323052 when hillary clinton speaks at the democratic national convention on wednesday night she will blow this ad out of the water
7323053 this was a hard fought and very long race and as youve already said 21 debates i mean you say a lot of things you try and get an edge over your opponent but right now i dont think theres any question at all that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama they want to see a democrat elected president of the united states
7323054 hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters whove been following her for a long time but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast because hes a tremendously engaging guy a tremendously bright guy and a guy whos sort of harry truman like he tells it like it is
7323055 well first of all let me say that i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7323056 cindys father barely finished high school went off and distinguished himself in world war ii in a b 17 and he came back with practically nothing and realized the american dream and i am proud and grateful for that and i think he is a role model to many young americans who serve in the military and come back and succeed
7323057 so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it
7323058 we spend our time primarily in washington d c where i have a condominium in crystal city here in this beautiful sedona that im blessed every moment i can spend here our condominium in phoenix arizona and a place over in san diego the others are also for investment purposes so all i can say is i am blessed to have the opportunity to continue to be part of a country where you can succeed and do well
7323059 he says he has seven kitchen tables we dont want him to have an eighth kitchen table
7323060 and we understand that he has a wonderful life this
7323061 and so when john mccain gets up in the morning and he leaves his house to lock his door he has to shuffle through a number of keys to figure out which key works in which door in which home hes at at any given time that suggests bob a significant disconnect from the average american who is experiencing quite a different economy than the one john mccain has been advocating
7323062 theyre going to say look john mccain good man american hero but he wants to extend the bush administration
7323063 of course were going to fire back and we should fire back
7323064 but it can be done in a way thats poetic and substantive

7323071 our take home message today is that the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
7323072 wtc 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings it did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires
7323073 i think the olympics opened many peoples eyes about how to come to terms with a rising power
7323074 while the olympics revealed the tremendous progress that has occurred in china there are many lasting problems
7323075 quite simply the beijing games look to be the biggest broadcast event in the olympic history
7323076 chinese government has tried hard to use the games to project an image of china which is respected by the world and is eager to play a great role in world affairs
7323077 the chinese want to present an image of china which is confident of itself and of themselves
7323078 it is well known that china has emerged as an economic power
7323079 in a short period of time it also has emerged as a legitimate sports power
7323080 it was very austere because it was just after the war and the rationing was still on
7323081 there was no olympic village we the cycling team lived in a private house and my mother came down and she was the cook preparing all the food for us we had spam fritters and toad in the hole sausages in batter pudding
7323082 we did get a very nice scarf and they doubled the butter ration from 2 to 4 ounces 57 to 113 grams a week for us
7323083 it was a big open air track 503 yards metres around with a bumpy surface and the wind blowing
7323084 now that unemployment inflation and growth are all worsening it is time for mr rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems
7323085 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7323086 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape
7323087 now that unemployment inflation and growth are all worsening it is time for mr rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems
7323088 someone who is having such a high old time using the n word very casually and conversationally in the bayshore might try using that same speech just as casually in other parts of this state where there is great diversity and see how it goes for them

7323091 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7323092 we dont have any concrete information on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7323093 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7323094 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7323095 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7323096 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7323097 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication

7323100 you could control not just your chair your tv your computer but your entire life
7323101 we figured wed be fine if they said disperse wed disperse but we never got the chance
7323102 you cant compare new york which has buildings all around to denver that has open areas
7323103 we would be remiss if we didnt prepare for mass arrests
7323104 people would sit in buses waiting hours days to be processed if we didnt have this set up
7323105 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7323106 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment
7323107 it has a chilling effect on free speech and that has been found time and time again to be improper under first amendment principles
7323108 were wearing aprons but everybody whos here the agents the editors the faculty the fellows the other contributors knows that this person whos waiting on you is going to be a very important writer in four or five years

7323110 its humbling we handle compost things spill theres a lot of running
7323111 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7323112 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening
7323113 i took a lot of naps and a lot of advil
7323114 its like having tiger woods help you with your putting
7323115 his behavior in the past may have brought about the perception where people immediately think of the nicknames as it relates to rick
7323116 trust is paramount to the whole equation the first time we met rick had to sit in a hotel room look me in the eye and basically give me an opening salvo that would create a scenario that would want me to continue those discussions further
7323117 understand exactly what is cover ed and how often youll use it and what your return on your annual investment will be
7323118 it depends on the condition of your vehicle its certainly possible you have one of those roadside assistance plans for 20 years and you never use it
7323119 if you drive an older vehicle then you certainly can end up getting your moneys worth
7323120 its often a perk with the sale of a new vehicle and its often the first year or x number of miles
7323121 if youre looking at a 50 or 80 investment youre also buying peace of mind and peace of mind means a lot to people

7323127 any time you force an audience to download something youre going to eliminate some of the audience partially because of the extra step and partially because the software didnt support some operating systems on windows or mac behind certain firewalls
7323128 denver is opening up shelters away from the convention site shelters that are usually only open in the winter
7323129 ich habe viele strecken auf denen ich gerne fahre vielleicht bin ich noch nicht lange genug dabei und nicht versaut genug aber mir macht es einfach spa mit dem auto zu fahren
7323130 ich hab da dann viel herz rein genommen und war extrem sp t dran ich stand komplett quer und kam gerade noch zum halten bevor ich mit kimi zusammengesto en w re
7323131 es ist eine katastrophe mit einem auto auf platz neun zu landen das offensichtlich gut genug f r platz drei ist

7323142 isnt it about time that we took the power of reality tv and harnessed it to challenge us as human beings to make a difference worldwide first one person then one village then one city at a time race 4 humanity will take ordinary people and pit them against extraordinary tasks around the world we will challenge ourselves and our audience to no longer turn a blind eye or feel its impossible to achieve anything in the overwhelming task of leveling the playing field worldwide to share just a little from others who have so much because its the right thing to do the time is now
7323143 the teams will compete against each other the elements people and places with one common goal to not only complete the challenge in the allotted time but to become international ambassadors of good and not only help but teach at the same time
7323144 our audience will experience the excitement of a survivor with locations like globe trekkers and the heart of extreme makeover all in one never before seen format that will not only entertain but help a world in need because its the right thing to do

7323153 community representatives from michoacan informed me that clandestine activities have extracted timber and the above is of total knowledge of the different institutions nevertheless it has not been possible to eliminate this activity given that they act with the protection of a group of loggers that threatens the region our reporting of this excessive logging has not been listened to and as a result the population in general has decided to exploit the forest themselves which with so much sacrifice our former authorities had protected the communities do not trust the government to stop the logging their cynicism reinforces a perverse incentive to participate in the felling if the communication between the farmers and the government is broken solutions cease to exist proposal increased transparency and communication between government and farmers government should listen to the forest owners facilitate reporting of logging increase personnel of the conanp and profepa expected result increased transparency and communication will permit improved capacity by the mexican government to solve environmental crimes bring out evidence of internal corruption improve government farmer relations viability there is a precendent for farmer ngo collaboration and the government should share this aspiration the webpage receives logging reports on the internet that are sent to the government simultaneously they are recorded digitally only transparency communication and public reporting can combat corruption and restore public trust

7323156 it was sent at 7 03 pm on saturday to a news channel which forwarded a copy to the cyber crime cell and the ats last night we worked on it and traced the internet protocol address to khalsa colleges computer laboratory
7323157 we have not recorded the statements of the students who were present in the laboratory at that time we are making preliminary inquiries and will record their statements later
7323158 one computer in the laboratory with an internet connection was switched on however the connection did not have any password and the accused might have taken advantage of this
7323159 the email is similar to several other mails sent on earlier occasions our teams are investigating the matter
7323160 as we are a start up company having operations in a highly competitive field mobile services it became imperative to go in for a cost optimization drive
7323161 earlier most executives stayed in five star hotels but now people in the middle and junior management who are out of town for longer duration on projects mostly end up staying in no frills hotels
7323162 we are witnessing some movement wherein guests who earlier preferred to stay in five star hotels are now opting for mid priced ones
7323163 the shift of deluxe hotel users has contributed an additional 10 occupancy premium to our hotels during the last quarter
7323164 this growth has also been buttressed by the value conscious business and conference traveller and we are delivering aggressive value for money packages to our retail clients
7323165 as most of them work long hours they are keen on having a decent accommodation nearby and a sumptuous breakfast the next morning before heading out again
7323166 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny i was never boney boney but i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
7323167 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny

7323171 the plane managed to takeoff then it started to sway from side to side until it fell

7323190 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7323191 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7323192 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7323193 the first signs of a taxpayer revolt came last october
7323194 something big is happening in british politics taxation has re emerged center stage and as an issue taxes favor the tories conservative leader david cameron was quick to exploit the change in the public mood giving a speech with the thatcherite theme of making government live within its means and the policy lessons come more naturally to the conservatives instead of squeezing the tax base and as the laffer curve predicts collecting less revenue than youd hoped do the opposite as happened under conservative governments in the 1980s tax reforms that cut peoples marginal rates and create far more winners than losers are good for the economy and for winning elections
7323195 harder for the conservatives to square with voters is their support for green taxes the public is beginning to realize that there is no pain free path to a low carbon nirvana unlike labour though the conservatives are in the happy position of not having to reverse tax increases theyve already announced raising the car tax cost bill clinton his first re election as arkansas governor having been forced to make concessions on the 10 band labour will also have to draw the sting of its higher car tax while politically necessary such concessions wont help the prime minister voters can see the only reason the prime minister is responding to their concerns is because he is unpopular reward gordon brown with another term and their leverage is gone
7323196 from 1981 to now more than 350 000 people from 90 countries were asked about their happiness and satisfaction with life
7323197 in the space of two decades several countries that were members of the soviet bloc have become members of the european union with new freedom to travel work and live
7323198 so if the world is becoming happier what are the implications first that the expansion of political and social freedoms is vindicated second the results may engender caution towards attempts to engineer happiness through public policy the happy countries include social democracies such as sweden and denmark and more laissez faire economies such as australia and the us what they have in common are not their policies but institutions democracy rule of law and social tolerance people are largely capable of engineering their own happiness when given the means to do so
7323199 after seven years and now faced with a long us electoral season the doha round of talks intended to introduce a new era of freer trade with fewer barriers between countries now faces a very uncertain future but we can be sure of one thing we would all have been winners from a doha deal without one we all lose
7323200 it is not just ethics that should make us hostile to bribery but economic reality the payment of inducements skews the cost advantages of the lowest prices
7323201 in order to be ethical the company will have to stop making facilitation payments effectively bungs to government officials in other countries
7323202 the old top down approach to governance will no longer work it is not just that the public have reached the limits of what they will pay in taxes although they have people in low and middle income families are under pressure and feeling the pinch
7323203 f r mich ist das der beste weg um mich auf ein rennen vorzubereiten und nicht abgelenkt zu werden
7323204 felipe massa hat eine bilderbuch leistung gezeigt mehr kann man nicht verlangen
7323205 aber ferrari scheint ein fundamentales problem mit dem motor zu haben der ausfall von r ikk nen tut im hinblick auf die konstrukteurswertung richtig weh ab jetzt z hlen alle punkte doppelt bei ferrari sp rt man nervosit t da ist keine ruhe drin
7323206 es war ein starkes wochenende von robert zun chst einmal ist es gut wieder auf dem podium zu stehen der dritte rang war die siebte podiumsplatzierung f r das team schon die f nfte f r robert in diesem jahr das zeigt wie stark er ist er war sowohl gestern als auch heute im rennen stark dort stehen wir im moment ich bin sehr gl cklich ber die platzierung auf dem podium die er erzielt hat
7323207 es war auf der strecke ein nicht so aufregendes rennen wie man es gedacht hat was waren ihrer meinung nach die schl ssel momente auf der strecke
7323208 ja und nein ich muss sagen dass ich auf dieser strecke mehr berholman ver erwartet hatte wir haben beinahe keine gesehen das war in meinen augen eine negative berraschung im rennen hatten wir keine unerwarteten zwischenf lle abgesehen von der tatsache dass robert eine plastikt te aufsammelte das hatte auf die stabilit t seines autos dramatische auswirkungen das war f r ihn und f r uns eine neue erfahrung abgesehen davon verlief alles reibungslos
7323209 nein es sah danach aus als h tte ihn robert ganz gut unter kontrolle gehabt nat rlich wussten wir nicht genau wann er das erste mal an die box kommen w rde als wir sahen dass er zusammen mit uns an die box kam war klar dass sein auto nicht schneller ist da waren wir schon ganz zuversichtlich dass ihn robert hinter sich halten w rde
7323210 es sieht danach aus als w rde es enger werden oder
7323211 denken sie dass sie ferrari und mclaren mercedes etwas n her kommen k nnen
7323212 die aktuelle form ist jene die wir heute gesehen haben wir haben f r die kommenden rennen ein paar verbesserungen in der pipeline ich gehe jedoch davon aus dass sich auch die anderen verbessern werden
7323213 ja mit sicherheit wir hatten gehofft dass er am start ein oder zwei positionen gutmachen kann so wie er das f r gew hnlich tun kann aber heute trat das gegenteil ein er wurde in der ersten kurve blockiert dabei verlor er sogar eine position das war es dann sein rennen war in der ersten runde gelaufen
7323214 es werden viele deutsche fans nach spa kommen ist dies ein besonderes rennen
7323215 ja ich auch lacht es wird ein besonderes rennen werden alle fahrer und alle fans lieben es es ist eine absolut besondere strecke ich freue mich wirklich darauf dorthin zu gehen
7323216 they rushed into this without thinking through the implications its a bit of a cock up
7323217 wir waren das ganze wochenende bei der musik vielleicht h tte ich im letzten anlauf noch etwas herauskitzeln k nnen aber es f hlt sich gut an
7323218 es ist ein langes rennen und wir wissen viel ber strategie
7323219 in q1 und q2 waren wir superschnell und ich war richtig zufrieden mit dem auto dann nderten wir den luftdruck und ich bin leider nur noch herum gerutscht
7323220 ich habe ein wenig zu lange gewartet um eine l cke zu bekommen einfach eine schlechte session aber wir haben f r das rennen eine gute ausgangsposition
7323221 nick wie viel spa hattest du heute ber 57 runden auf der neuen strecke in valencia
7323222 wenn man sich die position anschaut neunter platz dann hat es nat rlich keinen spa gemacht die pace war einfach zu langsam dazu kam noch dass ich einen schlechten start hatte als ich unterwegs war hatte ich robert kubica anm d red und kovalainen vor mir mit den harten reifen hatte ich gro e probleme zum schluss mit den weichen ging es wieder
7323223 hattest du keine chance noch an nico rosberg ranzufahren und ihn zu berholen
7323224 am anfang hatte ich mit den harten reifen gro e probleme mit den weichen ging es dann wie gesagt besser ich habe alles probiert aber es ging einfach nicht
7323225 nach dem qualifying hast du noch gel chelt was stimmt dich jetzt zuversichtlich f r spa francorchamps
7323226 so kurz nach dem rennen ist das schwierig zu sagen das war mit sicherheit eines der schlimmsten rennen f r mich alles zu probieren aber trotzdem nur neunter zu werden die pace war schlecht gerade zu beginn ich hoffe dass wir uns das irgendwie erkl ren k nnen denn der neunte platz ist in einem rennen in dem robert auf den dritten platz f hrt eine katastrophe
7323227 interpretiere ich dich richtig wenn ich sage du wirkst ratlos
7323228 ja im moment schon ein bisschen weil es manchmal von der pace geht wie wir in q2 gesehen haben aber manchmal auch nicht wie wir im rennen gesehen haben das mit den harten reifen mag eine erkl rung sein aber so kurz nach dem rennen ist es schwierig eine analyse zu starten ich bin ja gerade erst aus dem auto gestiegen heute ist alles schlecht gelaufen
7323229 wie verbringst du jetzt die zeit bis zum n chsten rennen
7323230 wir haben jetzt erst einmal das debriefing da werde ich versuchen zu verstehen woran es liegt dass ich die performance heute nicht zeigen konnte
7323231 der start war einfach gro artig wir haben die ganze saison lang schon tolle starts ich war auch froh dar ber von der rechten seite zu starten auch wenn man von der spritladung her zwei oder drei runden weniger fahren kann ich dachte dass es hier klug w re von der sauberen seite zu starten das ist vom qualifying her aber immer schwierig vorherzusagen in die erste kurve bremste ich etwas sp t weil ich beobachtete wie die anderen k mpfen ich konnte aber vorn bleiben
7323232 der erste stint war sehr gut lewis hamilton hat gek mpft und ich konnte in jeder runde um ein paar zehntelsekunden wegziehen im zweiten stint habe ich das rennen dann gewinnen das auto war einfach perfekt und wurde runde um runde besser es war toll zu sehen wie der vorsprung gr er wurde im letzten stint konnte ich mit den weichen reifen ganz entspannt fahren das ist manchmal ein problem aber ich fuhr hnliche rundenzeiten es war erstaunlich wie gut sich das auto im letzten stint verhielt das auto war einfach nur perfekt
7323233 wie waren die letzten runden f r dich mit dem wissen dass du im letzten rennen einen motorschaden hattest und auch dein teamkollege hier davon getroffen wurde
7323234 ziemlich schwierig daran denkt man immer man muss das auto nach hause bringen daran denkt man besonders in den letzten zehn runden man kann nichts tun nur fahren und die pace halten aber im letzten stint war das auto fantastisch sogar besser als in den ersten beiden es ist einfacher die pace zu kontrollieren wenn man wei dass man eine gute runde fahren kann was immer auch passieren mag
7323235 selbst wenn ich zeit verloren h tte oder er h tte aufholen k nnen so hat man immer noch ein tolles auto und muss nicht viel tun nur etwas mehr pushen das war einfach fantastisch nach so einem schlechten ergebnis haben wir fantastisch gearbeitet wenn auch nicht zu hundert prozent denn es gab ja noch das problem mit dem motor bei kimi daran m ssen wir arbeiten denn es wird f r die meisterschaft entscheidend sein
7323236 wusstest du in etwas wie viel vorsprung du vor deinem stopp brauchen w rdest
7323237 wir dachten schon dass lewis etwas schwerer als ich sein w rde vielleicht um ein oder zwei runden im schlimmsten fall w ren es zwei runden gewesen da h tte ich drei sekunden gebraucht und wir hatten ja mehr
7323238 was passierte beim boxenstopp als du neben adrian sutil wieder rauskamst dieser stopp wird von der rennleitung ja noch untersucht
7323239 ich habe da nichts falsch gemacht ich habe ja nachgegeben wenn es da eine untersuchung gibt dann sicher mehr f r adrian denn wir fuhren ja seite an seite als ich ihn sah dachte ich dass er nachgeben w rde denn ich war der f hrende aber das tat er nicht also gab ich nach wenn das untersucht wird dann hat das mit mir nichts zu tun
7323240 ich kann nichts dazu sagen er war auf meiner seite also lie ich ihn ziehen danach habe ich ihn dann berholt
7323241 wenn in der boxengasse ein auto vor dir rauskommen und auf deine linie fahren w rde sollte es dann eine bestrafung f r diesen fahrer geben
7323242 nein wenn alle zusammen in die boxengasse kommen dann ist es normal dass zwei autos seite an seite fahren man hat die linie die muss man respektieren wir fahren alle gleichschnell ich glaube nicht dass es gef hrlich war es war nur erwartet denn ich f hrte und ich war neben adrian im schlimmsten fall h tte er mich eh in der ersten oder zweiten kurve durchlassen m ssen es war aber nicht gef hrlich wenn ich nicht nachgegeben h tte dann h tte er es gemacht ansonsten w ren wir in der mauer gelandet einer musste nachgeben in diesem fall war ich es ich lie aber auch platz um nichts zu riskieren
7323243 du schl gst nun fast regelm ig deinen teamkollegen bekommst du langsam das gef hl dass du bei ferrari die nummer 1 bist
7323244 nein ich m chte immer alle fahrer auf der strecke schlagen es ist egal ob es um meinen teamkollegen geht oder nicht das ndert f r mich nichts ich m chte immer mein bestes geben und ich fuhr in dieser saison viele gute ergebnisse ein aber auch einige schlechte
7323245 zwei drittel der saison sind nun vorbei die konstanz ist deiner meinung nach ja besonders wichtig f r das titelrennen aber ist die zuverl ssigkeit nicht noch entscheidender gerade nach den motorsch den
7323246 nun die zuverl ssigkeit geh rt ja zur konstanz wenn man auch nur ein problem hat ist man nicht mehr konstant die konstanz ist also der schl ssel zur meisterschaft und dazu z hlen die leistung die zuverl ssigkeit und auch die fahrer all das wird bis zum saisonende sehr wichtig sein
7323247 du hast in zwei rennen nun einen absoluten nullpunkt und das hochgef hl eines sieges erlebt wie ist es diese gef hlsachterbahn zu durchleben
7323248 das ist fantastisch man steht wieder oben da wollen alle fahrer hin ich lag vorn als ich das problem hatte das macht es in gewisser weise noch schlimmer weil man den sieg vor augen hat und pl tzlich ist er drei runden vor schluss weg aber letztlich hat das nichts ge ndert wir kamen hierher und waren wieder an der spitze wir haben nichts ge ndert wir waren nur noch mehr motiviert wir m ssen motiviert bleiben und noch h rter arbeiten um auch an der spitze zu bleiben
7323249 with the government on course to break the rule limiting net public sector debt to 40 per cent of national income a new framework would initially be looser a consequence will be to make it easier to borrow more in the coming downturn although the principle reason for the change is to restore confidence in the rules so the medium term budgetary position might be tighter than currently planned
7323250 the irish government decided a few weeks ago that it would tighten its spending this year because tax receipts were falling is this idea so hard for gordon brown to grasp the entire country is cutting back its spending why cant government
7323251 the government spends too much and therefore taxes us too much
7323252 the government spends too little and therefore taxes us too little
7323253 taxes should be cut even if it means some reduction in government services such as health education and welfare
7323254 government services such as health education and welfare should be extended even if it means some increase in taxes
7323255 ordinary families are having to tighten their belts and cut back on luxuries government and politicians should do the same
7323256 every family is tightening their belt at the moment government must tighten theirs too
7323257 its a damn sight more than any other politician has had the guts to do

7323272 la pila de pa ales sucios en el closet debe haber sido de unos 4 pies de alto
7323273 el vidrio de la ventana se hab a roto y esa ni a s lo estaba tirada all rodeada de su propio excremento y bichos
7323274 me la puse sobre mi hombro y el pa al comenz a escurrirse sobre mi pierna

7323280 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7323281 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter
7323282 between 1962 and 1967 two notes appeared in our mailbox there was a single sentence written on them i am doing fine but if those letters were really from my father i do not know
7323283 there have been rumors recently about my health they hurt believers inside and outside iraq they are incorrect
7323284 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7323285 what was most galling was that there was nothing i could do this cruel disease takes its own course
7323286 i had to keep telling her the bad news over and over again
7323287 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7323288 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours

7323294 they dress like theyre in their 20s theyre also in new york city and i dont think a suburban person would be buying those things
7323295 i like the way it puts you in an alternate world like this is supposed to be the world we live in but its obviously not
7323296 some of the clothing we have in our store has been worn on the show and our customers do recognize it
7323297 most of the time they like the clothes but they dont come in specifically asking for them
7323298 i would say a big part of the reason i watch is because of what they wear
7323299 thats what makes the show interesting it wouldnt be as interesting if it were about a bunch of girls on a farm in iowa

7323303 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7323304 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7323305 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters

7323337 democracy is the rights of everybody to participate in everything that affects them
7323338 central will tell you that tomorrow we dont give you this anymore the local governments just keep quiet and that is a problem
7323339 we have been independent since 62 but are we really when we are still depending on grants
7323340 this has been one of the most interesting workshops we have ever had since i started in future lets go to the villages and share with them
7323341 this democracy is a tool it creates a forum to discuss important issues which would only be discussed on the street
7323342 this brings out issues which you will never even find through inspections
7323343 i saw this animal called democracy i dont seem to understand it much how does human rights and democracy relate
7323344 the people are living holistic but the educated have been in a small faculty and only know this small faculty those are the ones we need to capacity build on how to deal with real life
7323345 we have left our communities to be beggars how do we change them to be customers
7323346 we realized that the sub counties didnt have data how can they then plan for the different areas
7323347 do we have leaders rulers or managers in our community
7323348 does decentralization function when there are a high and a low class the low class live in the poor houses drink the bad water etc does it work when some people from above come and tell us what to do they tell us that we dont have the capacity so they will do it for us they use a lot of money for payment which could have been done much cheaper we have capacities we can run our own families we can build houses we have had capacity building many times but we are still looked upon as we have no capacity
7323349 there is no democracy at household level women and children work while the men are doing nothing the little we earn the men will take there is lack of information the men sell crops and land without consulting
7323350 if a girl misbehaves the mother is the guilty one the father gives her away and if the mother objects they will tell her that she is guilty of the mess
7323351 formally pta has a role but on the ground they have no function
7323352 these human rights have brought us problems now the children demand for their rights and end up misbehaving and how about our women how can we now control them
7323353 is it abuse of rights to put 80 or more in one class do they get their right to quality education fulfilled can you expect one teacher to make quality education for so many even with not enough equipment
7323354 the beauty of these documents is that it brings together democracy and human rights into local governments you can use it in church family etc
7323355 the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7323356 we would use this anyway since it is such a great process
7323357 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi
7323358 on a need to know basis who needs to know this much
7323359 im really exited about this little project the clubbers were expecting a long night of sexy house music and i think that they are having what they want

7323364 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7323365 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication

7323380 amber wasnt showing yet but everyone already knew she was debating an abortion but to larry novotnys great disappointment looking to be leaning against it larry would have to decide what to do about his wife who had just had a child herself not that long ago we felt sorry for larry who worried the curved finger smudged bill of his cubs cap endlessly that spring but we also thought it was pretty obvious that he should have kept his pecker in his pants we felt sorry for amber too but as everyone knows it takes two to tango we just hoped they werent doing it on our desks

7323382 it was very austere because it was just after the war and the rationing was still on
7323383 there was no olympic village we the cycling team lived in a private house and my mother came down and she was the cook preparing all the food for us we had spam fritters and toad in the hole sausages in batter pudding

7323394 democracy on a national or local level is not immediately dependent on democratic family structures and gender equality and then again how can a repressed woman be able to be involved in society if she dare not speak her mind in her own home the illustration is precise and direct it is also sad and thought provoking the more you look at the drawing the more alarming it becomes how do they feel in that family the illustration makes a clear and comprehensive example to symbolise what democracy is about the message is condensed in a concrete example that is easy to relate to rather than an intangible discussion of the concept of democracy

7323454 burnt mounds dont usually consist of very much more than a hearth and a tank and a heap of burnt stones but in shetland we seem to have much more complex structures with little rooms or cells leading off from a main passageway which connects the hearth and tank
7323455 we have approximately 300 burnt mounds on shetland but only four or five have been excavated and of those the cruester mound is the most fascinating and complex it looks as if it has been in use for anything between 500 to 1 000 years
7323456 we think these cells may have originally been roofed over in a beehive shape
7323457 one theory is that these structures may have been used for cooking meat or tanning hides
7323458 but it is possible they could have raised steam by heating the water and that these little cells could have been used as saunas
7323459 the local group here came up with a novel idea for dealing with the problem
7323460 it is great to have had the chance to give new life to this particular site and make it accessible to future generations while also learning something new not just about cruester but about burnt mounds in general
7323461 this structure is important in world terms there are thousands of burnt mounds in britain ireland and scandinavia but only a handful are known to have structures within them

7323489 we hebben niet gedomineerd maar om nu te zeggen dat esa dat wel deed gaat me te ver ze hadden in de tweede helft het betere van het spel en raakten de paal en lat daartegenover staan ook een tweetal enorme kansen voor ons het ging om de winst en die hebben we behaald

7323498 a man who wants to make a relationship work will move mountains to keep the woman he loves if hes not calling you to tell you he loves you and wants you back it should only be because hes showing up at your house to do it in person if hes not trying to romance your socks off with dates flowers and poetry it should only be because hes too engrossed in his couples counseling workbooks and its prioritizing getting back on the right track if hes not doing any of that he may love you he may miss you but ultimately hes just not that into you stop taking his calls and let him really know what its like to live without you
7323499 deciding to get back together with someone is a complicated and difficult decision just remember that the person you are getting back together with is the same person who not long before looked you in your beautiful face took full stock of you and all your qualities and told you that he was no longer in need of your company if aliens havent recently abducted your beloved and switched his brain for the brain of a guy whos really into you please consider the option that the bum maybe just got a little lonely

7323541 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7323542 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental

7323544 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7323545 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal

7323570 i talked to him when he was in the locker room in the training room
7323571 obviously he was down its unfortunate when any injury occurs but hopefully it is nothing serious and he will not miss any time
7323572 it looked like he was turning the corner and just kind of took an awkward step
7323573 the turf is hard and playing at that speed on that edge you can tweak things
7323574 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down

7323579 its often a perk with the sale of a new vehicle and its often the first year or x number of miles
7323580 if youre looking at a 50 or 80 investment youre also buying peace of mind and peace of mind means a lot to people
7323581 we figured wed be fine if they said disperse wed disperse but we never got the chance
7323582 you cant compare new york which has buildings all around to denver that has open areas
7323583 we would be remiss if we didnt prepare for mass arrests
7323584 people would sit in buses waiting hours days to be processed if we didnt have this set up
7323585 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7323586 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment
7323587 it has a chilling effect on free speech and that has been found time and time again to be improper under first amendment principles
7323588 understand exactly what is cover ed and how often youll use it and what your return on your annual investment will be
7323589 it depends on the condition of your vehicle its certainly possible you have one of those roadside assistance plans for 20 years and you never use it

7323593 he wanted the title atonement but discovered it was taken
7323594 specifically the premise of the book has to do with modifying your portions not with what you eat
7323595 yet i love to eat and i love to eat our clients food
7323596 he didnt run it past us and there appears to be no reason for him to from what weve been told his book is a satire inspired by the south beach diet craze a few years back
7323597 it certainly seems like it should be a big deal to the corporation
7323598 i guess id be surprised if the agency didnt take the first step of running it by the corporation
7323599 we empower our partners to make their own creative decisions and we have confidence in their judgment even though i havent seen the book yet ive pre ordered 100 copies
7323600 alex and his team have a history of doing things that totally break the mold as brilliant and great as they are i frankly more than anything am intrigued by whats behind the book
7323601 whatever this is and what ever debate it ignites i have no doubt that its something thats ultimately beneficial to their clients
7323602 we were looking at how to make our ad dollars work harder for us with breakthrough advertising in an olympic and election year
7323603 i dont know if caliendos going to like those though
7323604 you have to let frank do what he does best
7323605 its a campaign for change and everybody knows thats barack with a blue bag vs the red people get it
7323606 the only big news now is whos going to be the vp choices people are looking for something creative
7323607 we dont ever feel satisfied with our current media mix and are constantly looking to optimize either by improving response or reducing cost or both
7323608 as customers become more adept at using digital media and other mediums those fields have been added into our database were much more interested in measuring engagement and attaching a monetary value to it and less interested in looking at impressions
7323609 providing a 10 off reward because someone spends 100 today needs to be delivered within a personalized relevant brand experience
7323610 context is everything to the point of understanding whether 10 off is even relevant to specific individuals
7323611 budgets are getting tight with the economy and we all know its cheaper to retain vs acquire a customer
7323612 budgets arent being raised and in some cases theyre being squeezed so they to have market as cost effectively as possible the choices of where to market are expanding much faster than budgets

7323641 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen in the best western raid makes this particularly rare
7323642 the russian gangs who specialise in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7323643 according to preliminary information 20 out of 90 people on board survived
7323644 let me assure you though that this is romance at its most tantalizing there is a happily ever after that is well earned by the hero and heroine the reader who inhales page after page hoping and wishing that rhett would finally get it on with electra should be very satisfied with the ending there are more characters and events i could wax poetic over that are woven in and around the romance of rhett and electra but this review would end up as a small book in and of itself suffice to say knights fork has substance intelligence characters i really cared for and is a romantic tale with a satisfying hea i may not know much about chess but i know a good book when i read one and knights fork delivers the goods

7323647 national candidates tend to be more savvy and lock up their domain names early
7323648 savvy forward thinking public figures generally have gotten ahead of this and own web sites associated with their public person they either bought it early before they were famous or later negotiated to buy it
7323649 i was contacted by someone representing the kerry campaign the day after they announced edwards was going to join the ticket they asked me if i was interested in loaning or donating the domain to the campaign i told them no and that i had been offered 10 000 for the domain already which i had the conversation ended and i never heard from them again
7323650 websites are important vehicles to provide information to constituents and to boost participation in the political process
7323651 in the wrong hands a web address can be used to mislead and misrepresent a public officials record that is why i am extremely grateful that pool com allowed me the opportunity to renew my domain and ensure that the information on the page reflects my values and beliefs
7323652 let me be the first to say i told you so
7323653 john doe is not the enemy we know who the enemy really is
7323654 hey todd youre a mess and need help in the next five minutes
7323655 the shame is not in getting lice the shame is in keeping them
7323656 change we can kind of sort of deal with because we know the countrys been headed in the wrong direction and i really wanna like this obama guy but hes black and that kind of bothers me not that im racist or anything and then i also hear he might be a secret muslim which is sort of weird and then hes also got that crazy pastor and all these other shady people in chicago who he maybe kinda sorta hung out with once or twice and that wife of his really has a mouth on her but hes got cute kids though
7323657 i have a proven record of not doing shit for women other than letting them buy me houses
7323658 i dont need a crooked vicar how to teach me the best way to cure an itchy bum
7323659 i found out how to do that myself do you still want that cake its got crunchers hair all over it

7323665 that was three days ago ive used every cream i can think of but its no use my ring piece is on fire
7323666 i thought we had it licked for good last time
7323667 im fighting a battle with my instincts i have this overwhelming desire to salivate all over my succulent membranes as we speak
7323668 i was such a young hamster last time i was barely out of college i went from administering aspirin to applying cold compresses to thousands of rectums i was too young still green behind the cabbage patch so to speak it all but broke me i cant do it again really i cant
7323669 but even i can recognise wet tail when i see it how long have we got
7323670 youve got hamsters arse we all have you must notify the authorities immediately
7323671 join the fluffin scouts you can stick that idea right back up where it came from
7323672 see for yourself if the sleeves are too long ill take em up for you
7323673 i look like bob dopey the village idiot of banting badney he always dresses like this but the social security give him real money to do it he even gets a free go cart tune up and aphid milk vouchers

7323681 he just started swimming freestyle and backstroke and only stopped to slide belly first onto the tanks platform so he could be fed dozens of fried egg sandwiches
7323682 he fell asleep at the surface of the water around midnight
7323683 those seated in the first 14 rows should be prepared to get soaked
7323684 also michaels two friends olympic swimmers ryan lochte and jason lezak will open the show with their humorous beach ball antics
7323685 i have never seen a stranger yet more majestic looking creature
7323686 last year we went to seaworld san diego and saw michaels female counterpart michelle and even though the show was a little funnier than this one nothing compares to watching michael almost hover over the water after launching his trainer into the air
7323687 i liked it when he played dead and floated in the water
7323688 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
7323689 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death
7323690 even a 50 year old adult would have trouble processing such a monstrous notion
7323691 quiero unos bueeeenos gr ficos ya sabes de esos que te hacen decir ah qu chidos gr ficos
7323692 no dan his names pronounced like hey zeus jesus rodriguez hes in his third year and hes from argentina hes very nice but thats not who were talking about you need to get to know jesus

7323710 you know you learn a lot of things being up close with a guy
7323711 and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swiftboat politics that he so once so deplored
7323712 barack has the vision and what you cant forget you know his vision but let me tell you something
7323713 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous

7323725 in frankreich und in osteuropa sind wir bislang noch zu wenig vertreten
7323726 der vorschlag von frau von der leyen ist kontraproduktiv weil er die chancengleichheit unter den krankenkassen aush hlt
7323727 das bisherige system krankt doch daran dass die kassen nur noch darum konkurrieren wer die meisten jungen gesunden patienten hat wer jetzt zum kassenwechsel aus rein finanziellen motiven aufruft f rdert diesen ungesunden wettbewerb noch was wir brauchen ist ein gesunder wettbewerb um die beste versorgung der patienten
7323728 nur empfehlen schauen sie ihrer krankenkasse genau auf die finger und wechseln sie die kasse wenn sie mehr geld von ihnen verlangt die auswahl ist gro genug
7323729 jede kasse bekommt denselben betrag pro versicherten damit h rt die jagd nach den jungen besserverdienenden auf und jede kasse kann zeigen was sie mit dem geld ihrer versicherten macht

7323760 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7323761 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7323762 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
7323763 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7323764 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7323765 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
7323766 we should seek a steady mutual draw down to a ceiling of no

7323768 no one can expect that trade sanctions against beijing would yield a sudden transformation of that regime but american foreign policy should leave no doubt and the bush administration has left much doubt that the united states stands squarely on the side of chinas brave and aspiring democrats to whom power will ultimately flow

7323786 in recent years companies from intel corp to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation
7323787 neither the internal revenue service nor other agencies track this maneuver employers generally reveal little about it some benefits consultants have warned them not to in order to forestall a backlash by regulators and lower level workers
7323788 the trick is to find a way to move some of the obligations for supplemental pensions into the plan that qualifies for tax breaks benefits consultants market sophisticated techniques to help companies do just that without running afoul of irs rules against favoring the highly paid
7323789 companies often disclose little or nothing about qserps a few including chipmaker intel corp provide passing mentions in corporate proxies or other sec filings though the references arent always clear read an intel filing from last spring in which the companys qserp is discussed the key section is highlighted on page 53 of the 75 page document
7323790 intels case shows how lucrative such a move can be
7323791 now when the executives get ready to collect their deferred salaries intel wont have to pay them out of cash the pension plan will pay them
7323792 crazymans economics is not a typical investment book to be sure having read through it i have to say that it is not crazy at all but actually applies good solid horse sense to the financial markets
7323793 the root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behavior unbridled optimism on the upside and fear bordering on panic on the downside
7323794 please regulators lock us in a cage before we convince more people to trust us with their money
7323795 im sorry i forgot that robbing a bank was a crime
7323796 were sorry we forgot that issuing billions of dollars with no way to repay them was wrong

7323799 mad as hell and not going to take it anymore
7323800 my problem was that i kept thinking that it was something wrong i was doing in my investment decisions
7323801 after i did my largest purchases i called the company and spoke to a pr firm hired by said company
7323802 after a while i was up something like 35 000 at one point
7323803 but not one to give up hope i stumbled upon other financial chat boards that presented a number of companies paying fat dividends a very enticing concept considering where interest rates were at the time
7323804 i then remembered what the pr rep lady told me years ago about the stock market really being a pyramid scheme
7323805 increasingly fannie mae and freddie mac are looking like little more than devices to transfer money from the pockets of taxpayers to the pockets of fannie and freddie senior executives
7323806 executives receiving very high pay justify their deals on two grounds that they are risk takers in high pressure situations and that they have valuable expertise
7323807 and just what incredible expertise do syron and mudd possess
7323808 this is the core lesson of ceo overpay scandals the corrupt or incompetent executive always keeps the money
7323809 why does congress tolerate the swindle aspect of fannie and freddie for the standard reason congress is on the take
7323810 now that taxpayers are covering fannie and freddies cooked books the 200 million diverted to congress in effect came from average americans forcibly removed from their pockets and thanks to senator reid more will be forcibly taken from your pocket and placed into the accounts of senators and representatives this is what tmq calls a sliver strategy the sliver strategy is a means to disguise embezzlement congress looked the other way while fannie and freddie approved vast amounts of bad debt in order to shave off a sliver for itself in this case the 200 million in lobbying and donations had congress simply awarded itself 200 million editorialists would have been outraged because the money was slipped in to a larger fiasco of much greater sums wasted congress got away with it

7323840 we went to the hotel located her and arrested her without incident
7323841 whether its today or two years ago when the markets were much better is not being properly diversified
7323842 the majority of people who own stocks or stock mutual funds concentrate on the biggest u s stocks the standard amp poors 500
7323843 but as of july 31 if you look at the last five years the s amp p 500 is up 7 03 percent while the russell 2000 which basically covers small company stock is up 9 8 percent
7323844 during that same five years the eafe europe australasia far east index for international stocks is up 15 4 percent take this over 10 years and youll see the same things apply
7323845 but it pales in comparison to some of the down markets were had before
7323846 that doesnt mean that you should just sit idly by you may need to do some tweaking of your portfolio for both the short and long term
7323847 a good commodity based fund should be part of your portfolio we try to have 5 percent in every one of our clients portfolios the fund that we use for this pimco commodity real return tracks the dow jones commodity index so its in more than 30 different commodities it will not do as well as the energy based funds when oil is rising to 140 or 150 a barrel but over time it will do better and will certainly be less volatile
7323848 we do not feel that individual stocks make sense for anyone to try to go out there and find the winners yourself is very difficult professional managers are the way to go for both small and large investors
7323849 this is a good time to review what you have to make a realistic assessment of what you can handle
7323850 there is a danger of people getting too gun shy and going back to cds eventually things will turn and then they miss out
7323851 you might look to take some profits especially from oil based investments im not suggesting liquidating but to take some money out to preserve some of the capital youve made
7323852 weve been buying corporate bonds even in the financial industry there is a perceived risk but we think it is somewhat overstated
7323853 youll be much happier being a bond holder than a stockholder right now because when companies are raising capital by selling new shares the investors interest is diluted
7323854 people always need those things so they tend to be a little more stable
7323855 cash flow puts a little floor under you so if the stock goes down you still have a quarterly payment
7323856 exchange traded funds or etfs are attractive unlike mutual funds they are traded and priced throughout the day
7323857 they dont have the tax consequences that come with mutual funds so they dont have to be sold to raise money to pay investors
7323858 id stick with value funds they have a good track record
7323859 large cap stocks tend to be stable small cap funds do have more opportunity for growth but they are more volatile you should have some in both if you can
7323860 the biggest mistake some investors make is not knowing their risk tolerance they get very aggressive when things are going well and all of a sudden find that their risk tolerance is very low when the markets are dropping
7323861 the pity is their portfolio is down more than they can afford and they panic they dont know what to do and they capitulate and then sell making the mental pain into real financial damage
7323862 lesson no 1 is to know yourself what is your risk tolerance
7323863 everybodys life bridge starts at the age of 35 to 40 thats the time you get married buy home cars furnishings you have roughly 25 years of time frame to set your financial house in order
7323864 you need to do your right things at the right time
7323865 what at 35 year old or 40 year old person can and should do with his time horizon and what a 55 or 60 year old should do with a very limited time horizon are very different
7323866 its pathetic that people in their 40s say i cant take a risk and at the same time people who are thinking they may retire in five or 10 years from today put all of their money in risky stocks
7323867 on the road ahead the economic contraction is not going to be pretty it will take some time for this market to correct itself
7323868 whoever is putting together a portfolio today should be very careful realizing their risk tolerance with the understanding that in the next 12 months to 24 months the road ahead going to be rocky
7323869 etfs exchange traded funds have become fantastic theyre really cheap investments to buy these are new instruments that trade like stocks on the new york and american exchanges
7323870 you can buy large companies medium companies small companies in one investment that covers 500 stocks 1 000 stocks you can buy them very inexpensively
7323871 be sure you have a portion of the money invested in bonds be sure that you have an emergency cash reserve
7323872 and make sure that the portfolio that you build is built with three year five year horizons and if you might need the money next month or next year put the money in cds
7323873 the markets are going to be very rocky and volatile for the next three months or so because corporate earnings are going to be trending downward because of very poor consumer spending
7323874 if you want one word as a kind of caption for me caution

7323954 become fashionable to view russias involvement in south ossetia through the prism of the cold war with the 1968 soviet invasion of czechoslovakia as the blueprint but such interpretations are historical folly
7323955 let us be clear russias involvement in south ossetia is not about ideology nor is it about regime change in georgia least of all is it about re establishing the boundaries of the u s s r it is about restoring a fragile peace
7323956 while its move into south ossetia was triggered by the reckless and brutal actions of georgian president mikheil saakashvili its real target was washington and the growing american presence along russias borders the united states plans to bring georgia and ukraine into nato and to build a missile defense system in central europe have pushed russia to go beyond ineffective protests and take action
7323957 it began not on aug 8 but in july with a vast military exercise caucasus 2008 as dress rehearsal for the invasion as a flanking maneuver moscow handed out thousands of passports to south ossetians legally georgians to have a nice pr gambit ready what aggressors us we are just protecting the motherlands citizens so here we are at the fourth russian conquest of georgia
7323958 the problem is that putin still fully in charge in moscow in his new position is not only aware of the potential costs of his actions he is also willing to pay them if need be putin recognizes the importance of economic factors in todays world and he is committed to building russias economic strength but it is a means to an end strategic security that he will not sacrifice at any price
7323959 it would appear that ning decided to elminate widgetlaboratory for anti competitive purposes alone
7323960 longstanding policy against publicly discussing third party widgets and applications as well as the details of terms of service violations
7323961 our only goal is to have you build your products in such a way that doesnt slow down the networks running your products or takedown the ning platform with what youre doing both of those would result in us needing to shutdown widgetlaboratory products and thats has never been our first choice of options hopefully you know this after 8 months of working with us
7323962 if we have evidence other than our conversation last night that you are asking for username password and pin of other network creators on widgetlaboratory we will be put in the unfortunate situation of shutting down your network and widgets we dont want to do this in fact wed like very much to work more closely together but we can only do so if everything you guys are doing is within the terms of service

7323992 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7323993 passed over uses three video clips of clinton criticizing obama during their hard fought battle for the democratic presidential nomination
7323994 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7323995 and i was please that sen clinton gave such a robust endorsement to sen biden as the nominee yesterday he said

7324004 ich habe nach dem schlusspfiff meine mutter auf der trib ne gesehen
7324005 sie hatte tr nen in den augen und die h nde zum himmel gestreckt
7324006 dies ist der letzte tag der olympischen spiele und dies ist auch mein letzter arbeitstag
7324007 ich habe hier noch einige m glichkeiten entdeckt von denen man tolle spr nge machen kann
7324008 o avi o um boeing 737 com 123 pessoas a bordo despenhou se a cinco quil metros do aeroporto internacional de manas
7324009 segundo novas informa es h 71 v timas mortais o n mero de mortos pode vir a aumentar uma vez que continuam as opera es para recuperar pessoas de dentro do avi o

7324012 w rdest du dann bitte ein gehaltvolles buch vorlesen eins das einem eingeklemmte b ren in starker bedr ngnis hilfe und trost spendet
7324013 siamo contenti per il partito democratico che si sistemato in una fortezza di questi tempi le fortezze sono meglio dei loft
7324014 ich habe schon vor drei wochen gesagt dass ich einen holprigen start erwarte
7324015 wir machen immer wieder die alten fehler abwehrfehler stellungsfehler das zieht sich schon ber jahre
7324016 das kann man sich nicht l nger leisten wenn man sich so wie wir international positionieren will
7324017 es gibt nichts offizielles zu vermelden es ist noch nichts unterschrieben
7324018 wir haben dem transfer zugestimmt die entscheidung fiel mit elf ja stimmen und einer enthaltung aus wirtschaftlicher sicht gibt es keine schwierigkeiten
7324019 bis es so weit ist m ssen mit dem spieler und seinem berater noch einige details gekl rt werden
7324020 montag oder dienstag k nnte es klappen es ist nicht leicht die richtigen spieler zu finden jetzt sind wir auf dem weg gute leute zu verpflichten
7324021 wir haben qualitativ nicht den kader den wir uns w nschen es wird noch der ein oder andere spieler dazukommen
7324022 wenn jemand schon nach zwei spieltagen die geduld mit dieser mannschaft verloren hat kann ich nur den kopf sch tteln
7324023 nat rlich hilft uns das 0 0 nicht wirklich weiter aber wie jede mannschaft braucht auch diese zeit
7324024 es ist schon bitter und entt uschend wenn einem in zwei spielen nicht mal ein einziges tor gelingt
7324025 cottbus hat mit zehn mann am eigenen strafraum gestanden und wir sind nicht bayern oder schalke die so eine defensive trotzdem knacken
7324026 ein punkt nach zwei spieltagen ist alles andere als ein guter start
7324027 ich muss ehrlich sagen dass das wohl kein elfmeter war
7324028 in england ist so was fast gar nicht mehr m glich in deutschland auch kaum noch
7324029 da hat er gl ck gehabt dass er nicht rot bekommt
7324030 ich war am torwart vorbei dann habe ich seine hand gesehen nat rlich habe ich da versucht einen elfmeter zu bekommen aber er hat die hand dann noch rechtzeitig weggezogen
7324031 ich bin ansonsten nicht so ein typ aber wenn ich die chance habe einen elfmeter zu bekommen dann tue ich alles daf r
7324032 no sufro estr s porque conozco el s ndrome y s c mo combatirlo
7324033 der jahresabschluss liegt den wirtschaftspr fern aber erst mitte oktober vor
7324034 diese versammlung ist sehr wichtig so bietet sich allen kandidaten f r den aufsichtsrat die chance sich in der winterpause vern nftig vorzubereiten
7324035 da gehe ich davon aus dass er mir keinen schei anzeigt
7324036 die erste kann man geben die zweite war keine gelbe karte
7324037 fandel sieht es so kein vorwurf an ihn er ist ein berragender schiedsrichter der beste in deutschland vielleicht sogar in europa
7324038 seine fouls sind dann fast immer automatisch eine gelbe karte
7324039 der fliegt nach 20 22 minuten runter der ist unbeherrscht er schadet vor allem der mannschaft
7324040 die unterst tzung und das vertrauen der fans sind sehr wichtig f r einen spieler
7324041 es war ein sehr sehr sch nes gef hl wieder hier zu stehen
7324042 leider habe ich das ding nicht genutzt sonst h tten wir wohl gewonnen
7324043 wenn man sieht was er in den ersten minuten gemacht hat dann hat mir das fast angst gemacht
7324044 alle haben gesehen was f r ein gro artiger fu baller claudio ist
7324045 claudio ist ein weltklasse st rmer er wird ganz sicher in den n chsten spielen f r uns treffen
7324046 am anfang war es ja noch okay aber dann wurde es ganz sch n heftig
7324047 wenn wir was erreichen wollen m ssen wir mannschaften wie karlsruhe zu hause schlagen
7324048 nat rlich ist es etwas gl cklich wenn man in der letzten minute ein spiel gewinnt
7324049 aber ab und zu darf man dieses gl ck auch mal in anspruch nehmen
7324050 unglaublich geil ich kann es immer noch nicht fassen dass wir gold haben
7324051 mix aus zin dine zidane john mcenroe und tiger woods
7324052 ich will ins olympiateam kommen erfolgreiche spiele in peking absolvieren und n chste saison mit dem verein ganz oben angreifen
7324053 weil ich die sonne und das warme wetter am besten finde und au erdem dort wunderbare sandstr nde sind
7324054 am pool liegen playstation spielen im blockhaus essen und chillen
7324055 die natur das wetter und die st dte faszinieren mich
7324056 im februar 2009 dann werden alle 250 zimmer und die ffentlichen r ume grundlegend renoviert und neu gestaltet
7324057 wir gehen davon aus dass die autofahrerin mit berh hter geschwindigkeit fuhr
7324058 es werden fantastische spiele die russland helfen werden die junge demokratie weiterzuentwickeln
7324059 wir mussten alles kontrollieren die toiletten die l den die sitze alles
7324060 uns wurde nicht gesagt was los ist oder wann es weitergeht keine durchsagen nichts
7324061 die sagten was von polizeilicher ma nahme und das wars keiner erkl rte wie lange das noch dauert
7324062 sind sie von der presse wissen sie vielleicht was hier los ist
7324063 die dauer der ma nahme lie sich nicht absch tzen und die r umung wurde mit sicherheitsgr nden erkl rt mehr w rde den passagieren ja auch nichts n tzen
7324064 wir hocken seit einer stunde vor der geschlossenen sicherheitskontrolle und weil einem keiner sagt was los ist macht man sich ja die irrsten gedanken haben die eine bombe gefunden oder was die sollten echt mal eine durchsage machen
7324065 ich sa in der maschine musste wieder aussteigen ein unding dass niemand den passagieren erkl rt wann es weitergeht
7324066 direkt vor uns wurde die schleuse dichtgemacht die k nnten doch wenigstens mal durchsagen was los ist
7324067 wir gingen zur kontrolle aber da war schon dicht wir fragten die sicherheitsleute was denn los sei aber das konnte uns keiner sagen jetzt stehen wir hier rum wissen nicht wann es weitergeht das nervt
7324068 con algunos prejuicios sobre que se hacen monjas las chicas menos atractivas
7324069 fotos bonitas y expresivas que muestren la belleza tanto en el plano est tico como espiritual
7324070 una monja santa inteligente pero tambi n guapa puede dar mucho en la misi n de la evangelizaci n y de la pastoral juvenil
7324071 vivimos en tiempos en los que la visibilidad es muy importante y puede servir a las monjas para que se conozca su instituto o el carisma de una fundaci n religiosa
7324072 la imagen que se tiene de que las monjas son mujeres tristes desilusionadas de la vida y no realizadas

7324105 wenn der ball normal weggesprungen w re h tte ich ihn gehalten der platz ist etwas problematisch hier sehr holprig
7324106 der ball muss vorher drei mal gekl rt werden dann kommt es gar nicht so weit jens hat die gewohnte ruhe ausgestrahlt an ihm lag es am allerwenigsten
7324107 wir waren berhaupt nicht pr sent und nicht aggressiv leverkusen hat v llig verdient gewonnen
7324108 jeder kann sich denken warum ich mit ihm gejubelt habe
7324109 der trainer stellt die mannschaft auf aber im letzten spiel hat joe 88 prozent seiner zweik mpfe gewonnen f r mich und den rest des teams ist es schon verwunderlich dass er heute nicht gespielt hat
7324110 ebert darf das nicht machen er hat sich bei mir entschuldigt
7324111 wenn er so weitermacht hat er hier eine sehr gute karriere vor sich
7324112 toll dass ich die chance bekommen habe was nach dem tor mit mir passiert ist war emotion pur

7324146 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
7324147 watch this video notice that at 10 32 when mentioning sen obama she twitches her left eye 2 mm and makes a brief look like she got goosed by an oompa loompa this shows she doesnt believe in what shes saying and obambi is forcing her to say these lies you see it too right right right

7324154 abu tiba is assessed to be the al qaeda senior adviser in baghdad providing guidance and targetting assistance to subordinates throughout the city including abu uthman
7324155 abu tiba is suspected of terrorist activity since 2005 he was previously reported to be the aqi emir of the karkh district of baghdad and managed the aqi presence in the capital during its most active operational period in early 2007
7324156 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7324157 they never seem to move past the hand holding and eye gazing phase of the relationship theres no sense these two are actually in a commited relationship
7324158 lindsay lohan is not only a fake lesbian but shes a fake bitch

7324160 i am georgiana i am not diana the film is not about diana
7324161 there is absolutely no reason to have done this trailer which is a bad joke
7324162 the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana but they did not need to and should not have done it
7324163 my objective is to grown in the event and get the title lets start with a tough and focused work it wont chance anything in my life im always serious and go to any event to win

7324168 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7324169 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening

7324173 rather than check the difference between 0 and false or use a more appropriate function the original developer just dropped the first letter of each crawler name so that strpos doesnt return 0
7324174 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7324175 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7324176 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7324177 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7324178 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7324179 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7324180 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7324181 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7324182 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7324183 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7324184 aangekomen op het vaste land van zweden in kristianopel morgen weinig wind maar mooi weer 26 graden
7324185 this suggests australias economy is going to collapse because the whole of the emissions intensive sector is in dire straits
7324186 it is a desirable thing to do and therefore it is not a bad thing for politicians to put petrol up by 10c a litre
7324187 we have asked the icc in the tele conference for a checklist of security to be provided so that we could assess it during the home series against india in january 2009
7324188 what we now want is a comprehensive things to do list from the icc so that we could implement those measures in the series against india
7324189 when suicide bombings happen in pakistan of course those who live thousands of miles away from our country have fears but even the icc security team in charge had said the suicide bombings had nothing to do with cricket we had told the countries to send their representatives and make their own security assessments but unfortunately they had their reservations
7324190 not just us but india had also decided not to take part had the event been relocated
7324191 so lets get on board the waters blue and green it brings you to foreign countries more beautiful than youve ever seen
7324192 when times get tougher people think more about why they are here and they may ask themselves if there is more to life than making money
7324193 we stick to half an hour because many of our congregation have quite significant time constraints
7324194 we are always getting new faces in the congregation though we have lost a few to redundancies recently
7324195 staff and british waterways rent are our biggest expenses fortunately some of our members are very generous with their donations
7324196 posthumous baptisms by proxy have been common practice for the mormons for more than a century allowing the dead to be baptised into the faith so they may be united in the after life
7324197 it is worth noting that all bar three catholic dioceses had lifted any restrictions on access to the national librarys holding of microfilmed parish registered records some years ago
7324198 you should be aware that microfilms of the roman catholic parish registers are already available in many local heritage centres through the country
7324199 the archdiocese has not surrendered its claim to copyright of the records held in trust at the national library in due course a full statement on the matter will be made
7324200 crops which have been genetically engineered to date include maize soya beans canola derived from rapeseed and potatoes many biotech companies would like to genetically engineer wheat if this is pushed through the question will arise as to whether gm wheat can be used in the eucharist
7324201 the bread must be wheaten only and recently made so that there is no danger of corruption
7324202 for example people who suffer coeliac disease are unable to absorb gluten a protein found in wheat eating even small amounts of wheat can make them ill
7324203 in recent decades it has been possible to extract the gluten from wheaten bread so that people can eat bread without endangering their health despite the fact that gluten wheat poses a health threat which can often be serious the congregation of the doctrine of the faith stated in a reply in 1982 that the local ordinary could not permit a priest to consecrate special gluten free hosts for the communion of coeliacs
7324204 special hosts quibus glutinum ablatum est from which gluten has been removed are invalid matter for the celebration of the eucharist
7324205 given the centrality of the celebration of the eucharist in the life of the priest candidates for the priesthood who are affected by coeliac disease or suffer from alcoholism or similar conditions may not be admitted to holy orders
7324206 genetically engineered wheat will have an added protein which will make it tolerant to the herbicide of a biotech company
7324207 this raises questions whether it is lawful to use gm wheat as matter for the eucharist if notwithstanding a pressing health need the congregation of the doctrine of the faith refused to sanction gluten free hosts as valid matter for the eucharist because a protein has been extracted from the wheat how can it sanction genetically engineered wheat which has an added protein designed to make it resistant to a weed killer
7324208 but this is a qualified support as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7324209 but one reason influencing some christians may be what pope john paul ii described as the loss of christian memory in european institutions and policy
7324210 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7324211 a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
7324212 it has not been unknown for example for individuals to have to defend their right to hold political public or legislative office within eu institutions while professing a public commitment to their christian faith sometimes against very public and hostile challenge
7324213 ignoring this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself
7324214 frequently made without reference to religious values and convictions despite the fact that so many europeans have religious faith and convictions
7324215 i am just asking for calm consideration and reflection on those things
7324216 i am just asking that those matters be reflected upon especially in the wake of recent events he added
7324217 i think the people who are hostile to europe need to open their eyes to the contributions of europe and those who are totally supportive of europe need to listen to the concerns and the reservations we need a respectful listening to the views of each side
7324218 because i know the part that irish politicians and civil servants and diplomats have played in framing this
7324219 im raising these subjects to have them debated in the cooler calmer atmosphere people will recognise the distinct advantages but also the reservations

7324613 councils will naturally wish to ensure that council tax discounts and benefits are not wrongly claimed
7324614 the fact such snooping is already over used by local authorities bodes ill for the planned powers for town halls to access communications data there are insufficient checks and balances to prevent peoples sex lives being habitually monitored by state bureaucrats purely because they claim a council tax discount for living alone

7324627 i knew the kenyans were going to take the pace high
7324628 they told me they would go through the half in 64 30 but they were two minutes faster it was too fast for me to follow
7324629 around 25 to 26 kilometers baldini came up from behind me and i stayed with him that allowed me to get a higher place but not going at my own pace and just allowing myself to be pulled along was everything

7324641 mccain and davis objected and wanted her out ive never heard of a public official or an associate trying to go after an ally in the nonprofit sector like that
7324642 they were supposed to help make this a nonpartisan issue

7324705 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7324706 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7324707 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7324708 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7324709 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7324710 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7324734 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7324735 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7324736 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7324737 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7324738 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7324739 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

7324767 una buona gara contro un buon avversario cher immagino far un buon campionato per il sassuolo questa stata la prima gara veramente impegnativa e averla vinta va a nostro merito la squadra ha fatto vedere di avere la giusta voglia e la giusta determinazione e questo credo ci permetta di preparare con serenit il debutto in campionato
7324768 al quale spiega ancora il tecnico neroverde cercheremo di arrivare nelle migliori condizioni possibili anche perch conclude il tecnico del sassuolo a salerno sar certo molto pi difficile che oggi
7324769 sono soddisfatto era la prima gara dove ceravamo tutti compresi i giovani arrivati dalle olimpiadi oggi abbiamo giocato bene anche se avendo cambiato molto non ci sono ancora glia automatismi giusti la squadra cresiuta nellarco della gara facendo vedere cose buone e altre meno contro una squadra come il mantova che sar sicuramente protagonista nel campionato di b abbiamo ancora ampi margini di miglioramento in vista di domenica a catania ma oggi siamo venuti fuori bene olivera non mi piace parlare di un singolo per ha grande entusiasmo e qualit e oggi ha fatto due grandi gol
7324770 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7324771 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now we knew it was never going to happen but you would have thought they might at least make a show of it
7324772 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list you know you didnt even vet her you didnt call her you didnt seek her advice by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him
7324773 i talked to him when he was in the locker room in the training room
7324774 obviously he was down its unfortunate when any injury occurs but hopefully it is nothing serious and he will not miss any time
7324775 it looked like he was turning the corner and just kind of took an awkward step
7324776 the turf is hard and playing at that speed on that edge you can tweak things
7324777 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7324778 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personal to step up in his absence

7324787 an excellent book a fully rounded novel of london in the blitz in the summer of 1940
7324788 we got all the way up to fourth and then couldnt do any more than that
7324789 we needed to roll the center of the corner better but we just never found a way to do it and at the same time other guys got their cars driving better thats why we wound up eighth
7324790 the guys worked hard and gave me a great car this weekend
7324791 its just unfortunate that we got involved in that wreck and had to make a major adjustment i feel we had a top 10 car that drove so well that even my grandfather could have driven it
7324792 that never happens to us here its just bad luck
7324793 we had a great car and should have walked out of here with a top 5 finish to make matters worse a lot of the guys around us in the points had bad nights we couldve gained a couple of spots in the standings but i guess it just was not meant to be
7324794 it couldnt have come at a better place and time this is for everybody at suntrust and this is for everybody at toshiba and miracle sealants and of course mr gianpaolo dallara owner founder of the italian constructor came from italy for the very first time to watch us race we won the pole position we won the race it couldnt have been better the car was very fast
7324795 it was just unfortunate what happened with the no 61
7324796 it was unfortunate because we wanted to race them it was good in the race to actually come through together and battle with them and show that we had the speed we did this weekend it was just a shame they had to start from the back in the race i thought wed be challenged a lot more than we were from all the problems we had all year long it was a textbook race it couldnt have gone any better we kept saying our times coming the clock was ticking so it was nice for it to finally come before the end of the year
7324797 weve had such a difficult year but weve stuck with it every agonizing step of the way everybody who supports us suntrust toshiba miracle sealants have all stuck with us but in the last few months its been really tough now we can at least go back and realize that everybody is happy to know their faith in us has paid off im so proud of everybody there are not many teams in the pit lane that can do what weve done theres never been a thought of giving up by anybody its always been about how can we turn this thing around now we know we can win again and theres no better way to win than we did this weekend im just so proud of everybody and thankful to everybody who continues to believe in us
7324798 we were more concerned about demonstrating the technology to the customer than the record status
7324799 assess the actual situation in tibet and let the world know the truth
7324800 the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states joe biden
7324801 mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom
7324802 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington dc but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has
7324803 he understands whats going on in this economy he doesnt believe as john mccain does that things are fundamentally sound and weve made great progress when people are losing ground all the time
7324804 i think barack obama did exactly what he said he was going to do he picked someone who complements him
7324805 he picks someone who is of his own mind and will not be a sycophant and picked someone who is knowledgeable in the ways of washington because if barack obama wants to effect change part of doing that is having somebody with you that knows the institutions that you are changing
7324806 great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level
7324807 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation and especially the economy has come into the fore
7324808 joe is a guy who grew up in a working class household in scranton pennsylvania really understands what it is to have to scrap barack is a guy who comes from no means and no connections mother on food stamps when he was a kid
7324809 this week we saw a sharp distinction as these two candidates understand the plight of normal americans and john mccain cant remember how many houses he owns
7324810 it was sent at 7 03 pm on saturday to a news channel which forwarded a copy to the cyber crime cell and the ats last night we worked on it and traced the internet protocol address to khalsa colleges computer laboratory
7324811 we have not recorded the statements of the students who were present in the laboratory at that time we are making preliminary inquiries and will record their statements later
7324812 one computer in the laboratory with an internet connection was switched on however the connection did not have any password and the accused might have taken advantage of this
7324813 the email is similar to several other mails sent on earlier occasions our teams are investigating the matter

7324831 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss

7324833 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7324834 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure

7324836 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue

7324843 nicholas in case you read this intel won big time it will be hard to compete against the dells and intels of this world we all knew that and you did not accept the fact however where you could have been unique outstanding and special was guess what with education software out of the labs of mit and surrounding institutions and projects
7324844 if people in technical roles didnt get the internet you wondered what they were doing in their jobs open source is at that same place now if people dont realise the value it can add to their business then you might wonder what theyre doing in their technical role its mainstream
7324845 at the moment rescue teams fire brigades and medics are rushing to the crash site

7324847 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
7324848 i made a mistake and left before i should have done
7324849 i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon
7324850 it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title
7324851 there are still six races to go and 60 points up for grabs
7324852 we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realise things are now more complicated
7324853 david got involved in an incident on the first lap which damaged his car and mark who was on a one stop strategy was hoping for a safety car that never appeared
7324854 he didnt have enough pace particularly after his pit stop
7324855 we were hoping for a few safety cars to come out during the race so ran a one stop strategy but it didnt happen
7324856 it was a difficult race pace wise and weve got a lot of analysis to do
7324857 i came back and passed a couple of cars but when i tried to pass one of the force indias i aborted the manoeuvre and made contact with them so sorry to them for that
7324858 that damaged my barge board and the side of the car so after that the balance and downforce were very poor
7324859 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7324860 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7324861 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7324862 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7324863 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7324864 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7324865 although it was disappointing not to get two cars to the finish both drivers drove excellent races with good pace showing wed made a clear step forward
7324866 adrian was honest enough to admit he made a mistake but until that point he was having a very good race
7324867 we had put one car on one stop and the other on two to cover all bases in case of a safety car which we were expecting for this race and had he finished adrian on his two stops would have been able to finish just behind giancarlo
7324868 overall its been a very positive weekend for the team
7324869 it was a difficult race with the very hot conditions but overall i think it was a good performance
7324870 the strategy wasnt bad but we did expect a safety car after seeing the other support races but there werent any incidents so it didnt come
7324871 our pace was good it wasnt far off the others and we made a step forward with the gearbox we now have to keep focussed and keep moving forward
7324872 the first stint was ok as i was closing the gap to the rest of the field and then i could pass a few cars in the hairpin
7324873 it was a shame that i couldnt pass giancarlo quickly enough to take full advantage of the two stop strategy and lost a little time
7324874 once i passed him it was getting better but it was still difficult to pass more cars
7324875 then under braking i lost the rear and tried to avoid a crash but the barrier was too close and that was it
7324876 i wont divulge too many secrets here but well focus on providing simple calling plans integrating all our services into one device with a consistent cross platform interface and making our content and applications mobile

7324888 i came from a poor family my father was from glasgow scotland my mothers brothers were brakemen on the railroad we didnt have anything but mush for breakfast
7324889 its terribly sad and i feel bad for the people taking offense
7324890 those that didnt like it i forgive them and god bless america
7324891 god bless the universe god bless japanese chinese indians all of them and lets have peace
7324892 a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands so that gods religion islam is made victorious over all other religions
7324893 national security is supposed to be a major theme for the democratic national convention especially with joe biden now obamas running mate
7324894 inviting a speaker with documented ties to extremist terrorists makes a complete mockery of this emphasis on national security

7324899 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof

7324901 i had to keep telling her the bad news over and over again
7324902 the best thing i ever discovered in my relationship was that she his girlfriend will never be perfect

7324908 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god priest antonio rungi of the southern italian diocese of modragone told the daily corriere della sera
7324909 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm he said
7324910 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns notably from africa and latin america
7324911 sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7324912 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion
7324913 senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7324914 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7324956 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7324957 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7324958 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7324959 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7324960 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7324961 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7324969 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7324970 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7324971 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7324972 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7324973 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7324974 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7324975 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7324988 many of the victims felt helpless due to the fact many were illegal immigrants in this country fearful of reporting the crime and being deported
7324989 i want to make it clear to everybody that even illegal immigrants or legal immigrants have the right not to be victimized in this country
7324990 is all about ritual and stuff what youre doing now
7324991 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7324992 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7324993 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7324994 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7324995 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7324996 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7324997 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7324998 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7324999 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7325000 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7325001 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7325002 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7325003 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7325004 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7325005 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7325006 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7325007 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7325008 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7325009 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7325010 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7325011 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7325012 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7325013 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7325014 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7325015 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7325016 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7325017 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7325018 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7325019 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7325020 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7325021 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7325023 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7325024 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7325025 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7325026 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7325027 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7325028 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7325029 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7325030 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7325031 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7325032 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7325033 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7325034 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7325035 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7325036 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7325037 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7325038 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7325039 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7325040 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7325041 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7325042 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7325043 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7325044 who are open to doing something on the production side
7325045 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7325046 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7325047 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7325048 there is no one else for me none but jesus
7325049 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7325050 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7325051 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7325052 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7325055 other than the first set we played alright they were very quick and aggressive in the third and they did well in preventing us from attacking which was the key to our loss
7325056 our performance today is not too bad but it could be better we expected the match to be this close because it has always been very close every time weve played them
7325057 the first set was quite straight forward they stepped up a little in the second set and they were very good in the third we were more composed in the end they were more eager to win it and so we capitalised on that
7325058 im a bit surprised by the crowd actually they are very wonderful from the first day
7325059 we were quite worried that he will aggravate his injury here so we thought just come here and see how it goes since his return flight is from paris
7325060 i wasnt actually very confident going into this match because of my injury and also because i was defeated by him last week i just went into the match wanting to give me best
7325061 i actually like to play lin dan especially in the build up to the olympic games the more we play against each other the more beneficial it will be for me
7325062 moreover i will be able to learn a lot when i play against lin dan when top players play against each other it actually helps them to raise their games
7325063 i came to france with no pressure at all because of my injury i just wanted to give what i could and that was the key to my victory im surprised that ive won the title in fact
7325064 i decided to stop giving myself expectations on winning the major titles because past experience has proven to me that i dont do well when i give myself expectations and pressure i prefer to take it as it comes now
7325065 the french supporters have been very passionate and friendly i think theyve supported me since day one im happy to be here and will definitely be back if there is a super series or international open in france next year
7325066 im pleased and happy with my performance and victory here i feel very comfortable playing in france i could adapt very easily and maybe theres that bit of fortune here for me
7325067 and i suppose i didnt dwell over my defeat in denmark i got over it and got my mind into this competition very quickly which is important
7325068 im very familiar with pi hongyans game weve played several times and there isnt anything particularly threatening about her game the match against wong mew choo was a lot more tiring
7325069 it was difficult to play against xie as she is tall and could read my game so i was struggling to find a solution but overall it has been a great week great experience
7325070 i wanted to get the publics cheering so that the umpire will stop making mistakes
7325071 i didnt expect them to win today but their performances against denmark and indonesia were very good so my advice for them was to continue to play at their best and concentrate on the defense
7325072 i went to the referees table but they didnt see the point so they couldnt go to the umpire and i think there is a rule that says that the umpires decision is final
7325073 i think maybe the umpire forgot that the shuttle didnt go over as the boys asked for a shuttle change after the rally so there was a break between the point and the next
7325074 my boys also spoke to the service judge who knew that the shot didnt go over but the service judge kept quiet if he had gone over to speak to the umpire it could make a difference
7325075 i was worried about my players whether they could stay mentally calm and play normally but the spectators support helped
7325076 our players have never beaten lee and lee akao matsuda played especially well with very good defense today but i think the korean pair was also very tired especially lee hyo jung
7325077 before the match i told my players that win or lose doesnt matter try your best and give your best performance theyve wanted more motivation in their game so this win is good for them
7325078 our players put up a very good performance with extremely good defense as their netplay is not very strong but their good defense today has given them the confidence
7325079 i saw koo tan from denmark and know that they are in very good form now even though we had a pair beating them at the world championship i still think koo tan are top class it will be a tough match for us but ohtsuka masudas good defense could make a win happen
7325080 we like full crowds it is absolutely great i dont think they really care who is playing they just want to see great badminton
7325081 i think they are supporting the europeans which is fine we need a bit of help
7325082 yeah the crowd was very excited i felt they were cheering for us
7325083 it was a really close match we let the first set slipped when we had game point which was quite frustrating but we felt we were in control from the second set onwards and kept the shuttle really flat this time were very happy
7325084 we like to play people who have beaten us before and win them back very quickly
7325085 weve played against this english pair a few times and i think kellogg has always been unhappy with my fast service i did tell her after this match that its okay its only a game hope she is ok
7325086 i think kendrick played the best he played against me ever even though i was controlling most of the match i lost a very good lead in the second game even though he was playing against the wind he could still control the shuttle very well fortunately i knew that if i speed up the game i will have a good chance to break his control in the end i was also taking initiative at the net he wasnt willing to play at the net with me today im pretty happy about my game
7325087 susilo is more a runner he likes rallies and a long game but both of them dont like not being in control so if you start moving them around the court they start making errors and get impatient
7325088 i felt that we both played very well weve got a similar style of play serve well and get quick points with short rallies so it was down to putting yourself in a comfortable lead
7325089 tine was getting her points very quickly and consecutively in the second game especially and i fell behind from the start so it was harder but i was able to speed up my game in the third and also veered from making mistakes
7325090 honouring and celebrating and claiming womens craft knitting sewing as art is a very important part of second wave feminism
7325091 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7325092 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars

7325094 ja die koelkast van u springt inderdaad af en toe aan en wat gebeurt er dan met de stroom
7325095 inderdaad een piekje ja en die kunnen we meten en als de koelkast afslaat krijgen we weer een piekje en ook die kunnen we meten die meting kunnen we opslaan en daaruit kunnen we dus zien of uw koelkast niet een beetje veel stroom gebruikt we kunnen u dan een brief sturen waarin we u adviseren om een zuinigere koelkast te kopen

7325106 its still early theyre gonna go up at least back to where they were before because they know thats what were going to pay
7325107 most definitely it went from 4 to under 3 50 im definitely going to do some traveling
7325108 traveling as far as going from west to east is a big difference to me but im planning on the eastern shore and ocean city for a weekend
7325109 road travel will go down about 1 1 a slight decrease but again with gas probably going down a few cents more for labor day we may see more travelers take to the road
7325110 gas price does matter driving back to michigan today so i picked one of the cheapest gas stations its nice
7325111 people are leaving the car at home forgoing air travel and looking at other modes of transportation

7325113 in many ways my life has been an open book but i havent always been the one writing the story with this show however people will get to see and hear with their own eyes and ears what really goes on in my life and i think theyll come to understand me a little bit better with each episode
7325114 i have no resentment against arabs who come to kurdistan as workers or tourists
7325115 we want kurdistan to be the tourist destination for arabs who will pump money into our economy
7325116 all my bad impressions about the kurds have been wiped out
7325117 kurdistan is part of iraq and we encourage iraqis living in the south and center to visit the kurdish region
7325118 we have very tight security we dont want sulaimainiyah to be like fallujah

7325124 from todays perspective the situation at the ports is positive with respect to congestion
7325125 there is no significant congestion or delay at any of the surveyed ports now or projected during the next six months shippers have plenty to worry about these days but congestion delays at these u s ports are not among them
7325126 several participants in the port industry have taken steps to avoid repeating the conditions that led to the congestion in 2004
7325127 terminals have reduced free time and they and others have been more strict about enforcing demurrage charges for containers left sitting around which has helped increase throughput velocity at terminals effectively adding capacity
7325128 i think the best thing i have gained through this experience is confidence
7325129 its really hard for me to approach people doing this has given me a lot of confidence to just go in there be professional and do what i have to do
7325130 what i am actually doing is not the highlight of my trip
7325131 im really happy to get to observe everything in the main press center
7325132 and its been amazing the access that i have had to the olympics the magnitude of everything here is amazing
7325133 the chinese dont have the same concept of personal space as americans
7325134 theyre not trying to be rude its just their culture
7325135 they are very giving and kind people they go completely out of their way to help you
7325136 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7325137 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7325138 we figured wed be fine if they said disperse wed disperse but we never got the chance
7325139 you cant compare new york which has buildings all around to denver that has open areas
7325140 we would be remiss if we didnt prepare for mass arrests
7325141 people would sit in buses waiting hours days to be processed if we didnt have this set up
7325142 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7325143 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment
7325144 it has a chilling effect on free speech and that has been found time and time again to be improper under first amendment principles
7325145 the money to finance this comes from scholarships and grants
7325146 it is gift aid so it is not money they have to repay or work for
7325147 were hoping it will mean the difference to a lot of students who are on the fence about whether or not they can attend
7325148 its been encouraging because you worry about how youre going to pay for things
7325149 everybodys behind you saying go go go but no one realizes how expensive it is to go to college when your books alone cost you 400 or 500 or 600
7325150 you know my mom couldnt send me but i was hoping i could send him
7325151 the way things are now i couldnt do it and it would hurt me you know because why should he suffer just because i cant afford to send him
7325152 i dont know how i would have done it but i would have gotten the money somehow
7325153 eventually i want to work with victims of sexual abuse specifically children
7325154 i know whatever i do i want it to involve children because at a young age you are so impressionable anything can destroy a young childs life so just being able to get a child back to healthy functioning is something i felt was important

7325156 hes such a dedicated student and such an intelligent young man and hes going to make this world a better place
7325157 when the stock market goes down gold goes up our mines are doing really well
7325158 we were in a full foreclosure market six years ago when gold was 200 to 250
7325159 but mining went up there are some excellent job opportunities today
7325160 if they want shopping malls and stuff dont come here
7325161 youd experience a little culture shock this is a small rural community a safe family community
7325162 why wouldnt you move here if you are making 9 an hour in vegas and could make 21 an hour in winnemucca and not worry about having your house repossessed
7325163 we have seen some major mining busts it got so bad one time that i had to take a second job to keep the shoe store open
7325164 there are a lot of mining jobs available but everything is going up in price
7325165 we drive a bus we are booking as many shows as ever our best shows are in places out in the middle of nowhere when someone comes to town everybody gets excited
7325166 i have to sell 12 calves to pay that 6 000
7325167 they think they can get it for the price of a rental a lot of poor people have come up but they dont have 10 000 to put down they come down from oregon where they were making 7 an hour and make 20 an hour in mining and find they are barely squeaking by at 20 an hour
7325168 you could have the best credit in the world but you arent going to get another mortgage if you already have four
7325169 i told them an angel pulled me out of the water that angel was as real to me as my children thats what i saw maybe the angel screamed who cares what my brain would have thought when i was going through a crisis
7325170 it was an accident they tried to frame me on that i have nothing to say on that
7325171 ill lay in the grass and wait and when you cant see me ill strike
7325172 that doesnt make any sense because after this happened he and efren moved away together
7325173 my will left my stuff to her and hers left her stuff to me
7325174 he was preparing for something and i dont know what
7325175 i would almost bet she had salmon eggs but i cant swear to what she had
7325176 if she would have slipped she wouldnt have gotten past the log
7325177 i dont know if it was something i heard or some kind of phenomenon
7325178 people dont scream in cold water with a broken neck
7325179 that angel was as real to me as the scream but probably neither one is true
7325180 if anyone questions why i did it drive away from the closest store i dont know
7325181 i was in shock if st elmo was an eighth of a mile away i didnt know that
7325182 that makes no sense the whole thing was an emergency from the first minute
7325183 i was sitting next to nancy and i had blankets wrapped around her
7325184 i dont even remember having a heart attack why would i have a heart attack because she was alive im going to call him a liar
7325185 i just blew it it was gone in a few months
7325186 i told them i will meet you in person i dont know who you are
7325187 he crosses his arm puts his head down and said im not supposed to say anything
7325188 absolutely not if someone else searched it i dont know
7325189 they told me one of the best things to do was to get it down in writing its a common practice
7325190 he more or less became that person to win me over
7325191 i believe his interest in me was because i had money
7325192 if i would have married him he might have done the same thing to me that happened to his wife
7325193 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
7325194 all we have is seen a lot of tinkering around the edges that has failed when what we need is bigger initiatives particularly on the worker migration front
7325195 we recognise that no one size fits all approach can address the skills shortage and are introducing a range of strategies to improve access to information and training for industry training providers apprentices and trainees
7325196 weve already gotten some of the book bags but just some additional things we know teachers would want
7325197 i havent bought anything because its my final year of college so im running around trying to get everything at the last minute because i really dont want to spend any money
7325198 i procrastinate sometimes at school to do my work and i just procrastinated on going back to school also
7325199 i believe there is going to be a whole lot of people there for sure
7325200 one of the things ricky did was he was a giving person
7325201 anything he ever had he gave away to somebody else if he only had one hed try to find two
7325202 just thought it would be nice to get out and do something with the community and ride together
7325203 i think its going to be really cool and really loud
7325204 my main thing is the kids make sure they get what they need
7325205 everybody kind of knew what kind of a giving person hendrick was and this is a way for us to give back
7325206 no me cabe ni la menor duda porque yo mismo los atend personalmente todo el personal de la oficina y los clientes que estaban aqu lo vieron se trataba de una personalidad p blica
7325207 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes

7325221 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7325222 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7325223 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7325224 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7325225 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7325226 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7325227 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem
7325228 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7325229 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7325230 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia

7325232 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station

7325240 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7325241 what was most galling was that there was nothing i could do this cruel disease takes its own course
7325242 i had to keep telling her the bad news over and over again
7325243 between 1962 and 1967 two notes appeared in our mailbox there was a single sentence written on them i am doing fine but if those letters were really from my father i do not know
7325244 we gave the first video camera out in hebron in january 2007
7325245 the largest number are in the hebron region where the most frequent complaints of settler attacks are and recently in the northern area and the region next to the building of the separation wall where there are demonstrations
7325246 the project started as response to the need to gather evidence we were constantly filing complaints to no avail on the basis of lack of evidence or we dont know the name of the settler
7325247 now we are going back and forth with our video cassettes to israeli police station begging them to press rewind freeze it is the bulk of our work the value of the footage is not only evidential it also has had a remarkable value in terms of advocacy and campaigning
7325248 there was a conspiracy of silence surrounding settler violence in particular this footage is shocking to israelis
7325249 they had rounded up the foreigners from the international solidarity movement and arrested me and another guy separately
7325250 they put me in a jeep and started cursing me hitting me and using bad language in hebrew and arabic it had never occurred to me that they would shoot
7325251 they held me in the sun for a long time later i heard them discussing what they were going to do with me
7325252 i recall hearing a conversation about how to shoot me what i recall is the words rubber bullet rubber bullet i was blindfolded so i was only aware of their aggression
7325253 it was only when i saw salams video that i understood what happened to me the guy touching me on my right shoulder before i was shot
7325254 just before it happened they said theyre going to beat me they said they were going to send me to hell they know me because ive been to every protest
7325255 when i asked for medical attention they said this is nothing we are going to beat you more
7325256 these events that happen are often so distant or happen in the middle of the night where there is no media
7325257 where weve seen there is a lot of violation from the settlers and especially where there are demonstrations happening and we want to monitor the israeli soldiers behaviour we are distributing video cameras
7325258 it is having a good effect and it will stop the violations
7325259 we want to encourage a mentality to use the cameras it is the only weapon that the civilians have
7325260 in the beginning we were almost begging people to take the cameras with them when they went out they didnt see the use of it but after the media coverage over the susya incident weve gotten a flood of requests for our video cameras and those who have got the cameras are using them much more frequently
7325261 it is one of the biggest victories because it is the troops not the settlers
7325262 in this case it was remarkable that it was actually the soldiers themselves they did in fact open an investigation

7325301 i was really close to the title and i had some exhausting matches but this is where i think i felt really confident after that i started believing more that i can win a grand slam title which i did this year
7325302 as a grand slam winner you get some kind of relief and you get motivation to claim even more titles
7325303 i think this surface and the balls and all the conditions here in new york are suitable to my style of the game and to my personality and everything
7325304 a possible bailout of fannie mae and freddie mac on the heels of similar action involving investment firm bear stearns seems to send a loud signal to financial companies that the government will clean up their messes

7325316 being among the hard working chinese people seeing the volunteers show up at the arena every day with big smiles on their faces that just made us want to go out and play even harder
7325317 it was the moment ive been dreaming about for four years now i already had bronze around my neck and i wanted gold to finally get it it feels great we hadnt won in eight years and had been doubted we showed its not about the names on the backs of our shirts but the three letters on the front
7325318 its more important and more special than any championship any of us will ever win
7325319 winning an nba championship cant compare to winning a gold medal for your country
7325320 being among the hard working chinese people seeing the volunteers show up at the arena every day with big smiles on their faces that just made us want to go out and play even harder
7325321 it was the moment ive been dreaming about for four years now i already had bronze around my neck and i wanted gold to finally get it it feels great we hadnt won in eight years and had been doubted we showed its not about the names on the backs of our shirts but the three letters on the front

7325323 winning an nba championship cant compare to winning a gold medal for your country
7325324 there used to be a saying one more christian is one less chinese

7325326 i discovered that this kind of book china does not have china does have morality books for instance the analects of confucius teaches people morality china also has many intelligent writings for instance the buddhist texts but the bible is a book that claims inspiration from the will of god it talks about the history of the relationship between god and human beings and this kind of book does not exist in china
7325327 unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy as well as a clear notion of how he is going to keep the middle class from rolling off the table i am that candidate
7325328 senator barack obamas selection of senator joseph biden is an outstanding choice and puts the democratic party one step closer to winning the white house in november everyone is rightfully touting senator bidens experience and insights in foreign affairs however he has also spent years at the forefront of a host of critical domestic issues i know from my own work with him that joe biden is passionate about preventing violence against women improving our system of juvenile justice and keeping dangerous assault weapons off our streets he is a consistent champion for law enforcement and first responders senator biden has long been a friend and ally to my family and to me and i look forward to campaigning for and with the obama biden ticket
7325329 barack obama has made a first rate choice in joe biden
7325330 both barack obama and joe biden understand the tough challenges that face american families at home and americas standing and reputation in the world and as our next president and vice president they will bring our country the new direction we so badly need
7325331 joe biden is a great guy and a dedicated public servant with a proven record of bipartisan leadership
7325332 he is a statesman in every sense of the word i think senator obama made an outstanding choice

7325342 i have lived in najaf for more than 50 years since before saddam came and i lived here during the reign of the monarchy and the regimes that followed it and i witnessed the courage of najaf people in particular and the sons of iraq in general i wish you success
7325343 this is the strongest butt beer that is brewed from brown malt and often sold for forty shillings the barrel or six pound the butt out of the wholesale cellars the liquor for it is sixpence forfeit in the london brewhouse if the word water is named in the copper designed for the first mash has a two bushel basket or more of the most hully malt throwd over it to cover its top and forward its boiling this must be made very hot almost ready to boil yet not so as to blister for then it will be in too high a heat but as an indication of this the foul part of the liquor will ascend and the malt swell up and then it must be parted lookd into and felt with the finger or back of the hand and if the liquor is clear and can but be just endured it is then enough and the stoker must damp his fire as soon as possible by throwing in a good parcel of fresh coals and shutting his iron vent doors if there are any immediately on this they let as much cold liquor or water run into the copper as will make it all of a heat somewhat more than blood warm this they pump over or let it pass by a cock into an upright wooden square spout or trunk and it directly rises thro the holes of a false bottom into the malt which is workd by several men with oars for about half an hour and is called the first and stiff mash while this is doing there is more liquor heating in the copper that must not be let into the mash tun till it is very sharp almost ready to boil with this they mash again then cover it with several baskets of malt and let it stand an hour before it runs into the under back which when boiled an hour and a half with a good quantity of hops makes this stout the next is mashd with a cooler liquor then a sharper and the next blood warm or quite cold by which alternate degrees of heat a quantity of small beer is made after the stout
7325344 the implications of the olympics go way beyond a recognition that china is a sports power
7325345 there are many ways in which the games will move china forward
7325346 china set out to stage a spectacle that would win victories in the consciousness of others without firing a shot
7325347 and for many people around the world i imagine they have succeeded
7325348 i think its a beautiful country seeing it has changed my image and i would love to come back theyve sold me
7325349 i think the games have been a stunning success for the chinese government in terms of its international image
7325350 a sense of inferiority crying out for recognition and respect like a teenage boy these games may be a turning point to cure that syndrome
7325351 a sense of inadequacy to a feeling that china can do this and do it well
7325352 offers an opportunity for the chinese state and the chinese people to ditch the nationalist narrative of their identity based on shame and humiliation
7325353 hopefully they can throw all their aggrieved nationalist baggage away and move on like a normal country
7325354 what people saw was the patina of a new china
7325355 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7325356 when the overriding preoccupation with the games has gone individuals will have more opportunities to assert themselves
7325357 with society more confident some elements may try to lead the system forward faster than the government thinks is right
7325358 now we have had a successful international event that has gone rather splendidly this is a good test of how they deal with success
7325359 the question now is how fast it wants to run and in which direction

7325365 a particular way of brewing strong october beer there was a man in this country that brewed for a gentleman constantly after a very precise method and that was as soon as he had put over all his first copper of water and mashd it some time he would directly let the cock run a small stream and presently put some fresh malt on the former and mash on the while the cock was spending which he would put again over the malt as often as his pail or hand bowl was full and this for an hour or two together then he would let it run off intirely and put it over at once to run off again as small as a straw this was for his october beer then he would put scalding water over the goods at once but not mash and cap them with more fresh malt that stood an hour undisturbed before he would draw it off for ale the rest was hot water put over the goods and mashd at twice for small beer and it was observed that his october beer was the most famous in the country but his grains good for little for that he had by this method washd out all or most of their goodness this man was a long while in brewing and once his beer did not work in the barrel for a month in a very hard frost yet when the weather broke it recovered and fermented well and afterwards proved very good drink but he seldom workd his beer less than a week in the vat and was never tappd under three years
7325366 a philosophical account for brewing strong october beer by an ingenious hand in brewing your malt ought to be sound and good and after its making to lye two or more months in the heap to come to such a temper that the kernel may readily melt in the washing the well dressing your malt ought to be one chief care for unless it be freed from the tails and dust your drink will not be fine and mellow as when it is clean dressed the grinding also must be considered according to the high or low drying of the malt for if high dryed then a gross grinding is best otherwise a smaller may be done for the care in grinding consists herein lest too much of the husk being ground small should mix with the liquor which makes a gross feces and consequently your drink will have too fierce a fermentation and by that means make it acid or that we call stale when your malt is ground let it stand in sacks twenty four hours at least to the end that the heat in grinding may be allayed and tis conceived by its so standing that the kernel will dissolve the better the measure and quantity we allow of hops and malt is five quarter of malt to three hogsheads of beer and eighteen pounds of hops at least to that quantity of malt and if malt be pale dryed then add three or four pounds of hops more the choice of liquor for brewing is of considerable advantage in making good drink the softest and cleanest water is to be prererrd your harsh water is not to be made use of you are to boil your first liquor adding a handful or two of hops to it then before you strike it over to your goods or malt cool in as much liquor as will bring it to a temper not to scald the malt for it is a fault not to take the liquor as high as possible but not to scald the next liquors do the same and indeed all your liquors ought to be taken as high as may be that is not to scald when you let your wort from your malt into the underback put to it a handful or two of hops twill preserve it from that accident which brewers call blinking or foxing in boiling your worts the first wort boil high or quick for the quicker the first wort is boiled the better it is the second boil more than the first and the third or last more than the second in cooling lay your worts thin and let each be well cooled and care must be taken in letting them down into the tun that you do it leisurely to the end that as little of the feces or sediment which causes the fermentation to be fierce or mild for note there is in all fermented liquors salt and sulphur and to keep these two bodies in a due proportion that the salt does not exalt itself above the sulphur consists a great part of the art in brewing when your wort is first let into your tun put but a little yeast to it and let it work by degrees quietly and if you find it works but moderate whip in the yeast two or three times or more till you find your drink well fermented for without a full opening of the body by fermentation it will not be perfect fine nor will it drink clean and light when you cleanse do it by a cock from your tun placed six inches from the bottom to the end that most of the sediment may be left behind which may be thrown on your malt to mend your small beer when your drink is tunnd fill your vessel full let it work at the bung hole and have a reserve in a small cask to fill it up and dont put any of the drink which will be under the yeast after it is workd over into your vessels but put it by itself in another cask for it will not be so good as your other in the cask this done you must wait for the finishing of the fermentation then stop it close and let it stand till the spring for brewing ought to be done in the month of october that it may have time to settle and digest all the winter season in the spring you must unstop your vent hole and thereby see whether your drink doth ferment or not for as soon as the warm weather comes your drink will have another fermentation which when it is over let it be again well stopped and stand till september or longer and then peg it and if you find it pretty fine the hop well rotted and of a good pleasant taste for drinking then and not before draw out a gallon of it put to it two ounces of ising glass cut small and well beaten to melt stirring it often and whip it with a wisk till the ising glass be melted then strain it and put it into your vessel stirring it well together stop the bung slightly for this will cause a new and small fermentation when that is over stop it close leaving only a vent hole a little stoppd let it stand and in ten days or a little more it will be transparently fine and you may drink of it out of the vessel till two parts in three be drawn then bottle the rest which will in a little time come to drink very well if your drink in september be well conditiond for taste but not fine and you desire to drink it presently rack it before you put your ising glass to it and then it will fine the better and drink the cleaner to make drink fine quickly i have been told that by separating the liquor from the feces when the wort is let out of the tun into the underback which may be done in this manner when you let your wort into your underback out of your tun catch the wort in some tub so long and so often as you find it run foul put that so catched on the malt again and do so till the wort run clear into the underback this is to me a very good way where it may be done for tis the feces which causes the fierce and violent fermentation and to hinder that in some measure is the way to have fine drink note that the finer you make your wort the sooner your drink will be fine for i have heard that some curious in brewing have caused flannels to be so placed that all the wort may run thro one or more of them into the tun before working by which means the drink was made very fine and well tasted
7325367 wynkoop is one of the pioneers in colorados craft beer history
7325368 im really excited about setting a new standard here and increasing peoples recognition of the wynkoop as the oldest and biggest anchor of the denver brewpub scene
7325369 few brewpubs in the us serve as much cask conditioned beer as we do here
7325370 and the open fermenters allow a different flavor development during fermentation than the unitanks most craft brewers use the large number of storage tanks here also allow me to make lager beers in the classic slowly aged method
7325371 our original brewer russell schehrer set the tone for us with his focus on innovation and british style beers weve lost some of that focus over the past few years these days were looking to raise the bar in all aspects of the brewpub and andy will help us reclaim our great reputation on the beer side of things
7325372 gives us the opportunity to elevate our beers and build on our legacy
7325373 im really enjoying the brewpub setting and the contact with servers bartenders and beer lovers
7325374 plus i live just a few blocks away and can ride my bike to work every day now
7325375 i hope the same mask that protected me in beijing will help him protect his people
7325376 some italian athletes autonomously and without renouncing their commitment to sports made a symbolic gesture in favor of tibet and the dalai lama
7325377 in the field of great conquests for civil rights public opinion makes the difference and to move public opinion the gesture of an athlete is more important than the gesture

7325390 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7325391 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7325392 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7325393 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you

7325412 the great thing about joe biden during the alito hearings the reason he is to me actually endearing is that as he speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again as he did in the roberts hearings and even the thomas hearings that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going i love him hes human like a garrulous uncle after a drink

7325421 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
7325422 however at last it was realised that the duty on malt surpassed by much the duty on hops from whence the brewers endeavoured at a liquor wherein more of these last should be used thus the drinking of beer came to be encouraged in preference to ale this beer when new was sold for 1 2 per barrel but the people not easily weaned from their wonted sweet heavy drink in general used ale mixed with beer which they purchased from the ale draper at twopence halfpenny and twopence three farthings per quart
7325423 at bridport in dorsetshire i knew an inn keeper use half pale and half brown malt for brewing his butt beers that proved to my palate the best i ever drank on the road which i think may be accounted for in that the pale being the slackest and the brown the hardest dryed must produce a mellow good drink by the help of a requisite age that will reduce those extreams to a proper quality
7325424 the proportion of hops may be half a pound to an hogshead of strong ale one pound to an hogshead of ordinary strong beer to be soon drank out and two pounds to an hogshead of march or october beer
7325425 it is pretended that march is the best month for brewing and the water then better than in october but i allways found that the october beer having so many cold months to digest in proves the better drink by much and requires not such watching and tending as the march beer does in opening and stopping the vent hole on every change of weather
7325426 common butt beer is at this time in greater reputation than ever in london and the drinks out of credit
7325427 hes been counting words by hand for the past 20 years

7325431 for drink there was beer which was very strong when not mingled with water but was agreeable to those who were used to it they drank this with a reed out of the vessel that held the beer upon which they saw the barley swim

7325436 my dad was a big tim leary fan in his day and he had tripped on acid so my father was very descriptive about the high and what happens and he broke down the timeline for me
7325437 my dad was a drug dealer for most of my life im sure there was a time when drugs were really fun for my dad but after you have a kid the party is over i got to grow up in a situation where drugs were demonic to watch your dad going through heroin withdrawals is something that would stray you from doing any of that he also grew up in a different time where literally theyd line up coke lines on the craft services tables for grips
7325438 to say ive never smoked would be insane to say i never had a drink would be insane i mean i had a drink at my bar mitzvah i had my first joint before i had my first drink i smoke cigarettes but i dont drink coffee because i get anxiety attacks being on coke i would die i just know myself enough

7325451 the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states joe biden
7325452 mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom
7325453 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington dc but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has
7325454 he understands whats going on in this economy he doesnt believe as john mccain does that things are fundamentally sound and weve made great progress when people are losing ground all the time
7325455 i think barack obama did exactly what he said he was going to do he picked someone who complements him
7325456 he picks someone who is of his own mind and will not be a sycophant and picked someone who is knowledgeable in the ways of washington because if barack obama wants to effect change part of doing that is having somebody with you that knows the institutions that you are changing
7325457 great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level
7325458 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation and especially the economy has come into the fore

7325461 this surfin is safe useful its cleaning and easy for nerds wii balance board is great
7325462 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
7325463 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
7325464 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
7325465 im committed to making sure that theres equal pay for equal work that is my record and you can count on it
7325466 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
7325467 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7325468 read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what
7325469 im not making a read my lips statement in that i will not raise taxes

7325471 corrupt a shill for dictators and with just a dose of sarcasm jack abramoffs gay lover
7325472 i am so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7325473 i had the flu when i arrived pretty hard fevers every day and low energy
7325474 i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck and it kind of did nearly lead me to not racing this weekend
7325475 its always very tight when you start from the back of the grid with the cars so close together
7325476 then i saw in the mirror there was no wing we tried to repair the car in order to race for the fans but then we saw there was more damage than we thought
7325477 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7325478 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7325479 it got a little crusty and the wind picked up a little bit but i didnt do very well
7325480 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7325481 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have imagined
7325482 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger
7325483 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7325484 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7325485 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7325486 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7325487 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7325488 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7325489 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7325490 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7325491 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7325492 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7325493 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7325494 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7325495 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7325496 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7325497 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7325498 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7325499 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7325500 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7325501 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7325502 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7325503 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7325504 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7325505 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7325506 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7325507 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7325508 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7325509 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7325510 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7325511 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change
7325512 it is more fulfilling of course because it concerns talent the beatles didnt make it because of me but because of the songs they wrote
7325513 we have had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7325514 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked
7325515 we work very closely with german tv and the german book publisher and we love all germans
7325516 i was driven to tell a certain kind of story about global consciousness and interconnectivity i asked can people with these powers find each other defeat evil and save the world it was important to have people in the show that werent just blonde haired blue eyed californians
7325517 our relationship with our audience is tenuous but they are passionate intense involved and yes obsessive
7325518 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7325519 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7325520 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7325521 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7325522 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7325523 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7325524 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7325525 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7325526 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7325527 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7325528 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7325529 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7325530 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7325531 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7325532 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7325533 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7325534 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7325535 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7325536 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7325537 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7325538 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7325539 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7325540 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7325541 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7325542 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7325543 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7325544 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7325545 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7325546 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7325547 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7325548 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7325549 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7325550 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7325551 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7325552 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7325553 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7325554 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7325555 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7325556 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7325557 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7325558 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7325559 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7325560 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7325561 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7325562 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7325563 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7325564 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7325565 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7325566 oh i have a big problem here i got no money because i forgot to bring my wallet
7325567 no worries its ok i have a spot for you near the wall there
7325568 oh dont pay and just leave its too good for us if all customers are like you
7325569 personal adjustment problems showing up in all kinds of places it was fairly clear that we were going to be seeing more of those things
7325570 were busier than ever and we havent had any recent publicity or visibility
7325571 and we havent seen the full bore of the housing crisis
7325572 you can really see how full your schedule is getting
7325573 financial stress job layoffs housing problems transportation all of which can complicate and heighten an already existing diagnosis of depression or anxiety
7325574 the standard percentage paid by the insurance company used to be 80 20
7325575 whose family is under such financial stress that she cant come anymore which is horrible ill reduce my fee but its the gas to get here theyre going down to one car and they cant spare the car
7325576 families where the main breadwinner is in the mortgage and housing industry are just being killed by this therapy is a luxury for every family
7325577 its harder to pick up the phone especially for those who have never been seen in the mental health system theres still a stigma add economic barriers and that takes it to another level entirely
7325578 definitely seeing more prospects coming in specifically looking for additional help
7325579 if im laid off how do i manage my money for a few months
7325580 someone who could come alongside them and give them guidance and emotional confidence
7325581 i try to help clients focus on what they have control over
7325582 maybe a mechanic friend helps you with your car and you pay them back by fixing their computer
7325583 from the moment last thursday when donnette was struck down scores of new yorkers pulled together as one to try to save her and her still unborn child
7325584 the bystanders who heroically rescued donnette from under a school bus in the bronx didnt just lift five tons of glass and steel they also lifted the spirits of our entire city
7325585 this is such an unbelievable tragedy that took place it took away one of our own
7325586 but im so thankful to the city of new york and to the citizens who came to her aid like real heroes out of a comic book
7325587 ich freue mich wenn herr m ntefering wiederkommt wir haben gut zusammengearbeitet
7325588 obama was 11 when biden entered congress i guess theyre going fishin together is this race already being framed biden vs mccain that would be a big oops
7325589 been very good however this time theres just so much more of it
7325590 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7325591 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7325592 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7325593 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7325594 now that unemployment inflation and growth are all worsening it is time for mr rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems
7325595 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7325596 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape
7325597 now that unemployment inflation and growth are all worsening it is time for mr rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems
7325598 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
7325599 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7325600 we dont have any concrete information on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7325601 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7325602 education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army
7325603 aqu hay mucha gete que ha dicho no se que m s que no estuvieron a la altura que atacan al gobierno pero como dijno el quijote si ladran los perros es porque cabalgamos
7325604 con este episodio de las olimpiadas y la pasi n que se desbord en venezuela y aqu en mi coraz n yo personalmente voy a estar mucho m s pendiente del deporte apoyando lo que haga falta
7325605 education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army
7325606 i got by on this one walking a lot of people knowing me and word of mouth im just trying to do the best i can for el segundo and i think people recognized that
7325607 he likes the photocopied look because that demonstrates i believe a certain type of fiscal conservatism
7325608 however one could make an argument that demonstrating your ability to raise money and support for yourself would also demonstrate your ability to advocate for the city
7325609 it depends on what kind of campaign you are running
7325610 if you are running a campaign for the first time and the voters dont necessarily know you as well it will require much more money
7325611 i chose to raise money from my neighbors and my friends because i am more effective at that and i can do that fairly quickly as opposed to having the time to walk door to door
7325612 was it worth it to be on the city council for another four years absolutely
7325613 i want to make sure this city is in as good condition as possible and i want to make sure this city has a very bright future
7325614 being a good steward of the resources we were given
7325615 i ring my contacts and theyre all in abu dhabi
7325616 these are the guys the sovereign wealth funds want to work with guys so far off the radar they make the hedge funds look transparent
7325617 greenspan was part of a new political culture that started in the 1990s and violated the integrity of his predecessor paul volcker
7325618 feel good politicians like bill clinton and tony blair started telling people only what they wanted to hear
7325619 if the chinese wont revalue it the us needs to talk about import tariffs
7325620 regulatory reform proper incentives for bankers these are valid issues
7325621 the final tally will depend in large measure on us house prices and the broader stabilisation of the credit markets
7325622 how you deal with the coming changes say half the general motors assembly line moving to china will determine where the downturn comes out
7325623 a vantagem principal a continuidade que pode ficar ali o tempo todo
7325624 achamos que o zephyr est perto de ser um sistema operacional desejamos que seja nos pr ximos dois anos
7325625 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7325626 we really need to make a statement to the community that we believe the bible thou shall not kill
7325627 we go to the abortion clinics and tell people there are other alternatives to educate people you dont have to do this
7325628 although black women constitute only 6 of the population they comprise 36 of the abortion industrys clientele the leading abortion providers have chosen to exploit blacks by locating 94 of their abortuaries in urban neighborhoods with high black populations this high rate of abortion has decimated the black family and destroyed black neighborhoods to the detriment of society at large

7325633 pens que no era el momento de dimitir justo cuando se renuevan las plantillas y que no era conveniente que el bar a se quedase sin presidente a principio de temporada e iniciar una espiral de procesos electorales

7325668 you might throw it at somebody said the guard who had gone through my bag and removed the shiny red apple that i was planning to enjoy here he made a short pitching motion with the apple to demonstrate what he was suggesting
7325669 i talked to him when he was in the locker room in the training room
7325670 obviously he was down its unfortunate when any injury occurs but hopefully it is nothing serious and he will not miss any time
7325671 it looked like he was turning the corner and just kind of took an awkward step
7325672 the turf is hard and playing at that speed on that edge you can tweak things
7325673 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7325674 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personal to step up in his absence
7325675 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7325676 what was most galling was that there was nothing i could do this cruel disease takes its own course
7325677 i had to keep telling her the bad news over and over again
7325678 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7325679 they try and preach it to whoever comes in here
7325680 you dont play if you dont think youre going to win
7325681 we think were going to win every time out no matter who we face no matter who were playing individually and as a team so i dont think any of us are surprised that were here because were playing how we expect to play obviously it doesnt work out like that every year but if we actually play up to our own expectations you should be successful right now were playing well as a team and different guys are stepping up every night to get us wins
7325682 thats only going to help them for the future regardless of how the season plays out
7325683 miss sister 2008 contest will start in september on a blog run by the rev antonio rungi and will give nuns from around the world a chance to showcase their work and their image
7325684 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7325685 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7325686 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7325687 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7325688 the prices of houses seem to have reached a plateau and there is reasonable expectancy that prices will decline
7325689 in dallas the economic conditions for a strong housing market are still there positive job growth cheap mortgage rates and continued home price appreciation
7325690 oh by the way if you or anyone you know wants to buy or sell a home please give ron or becky barber a call now
7325691 we expect this trend to continue in the months ahead but well see modest appreciation in most of the country in 2007

7325695 the investment in staging is always less than your first price reduction
7325696 ive been thinking about switching jobs and finding something that will provide better benefits and salary for me and my new wife but i was typing up a new resume and realized that at 28 i have five jobs that are one year apiece how can i spin that in an interview as a positive can i just tell the truth and say that im not finding what i need or do you think that might be a kiss of death
7325697 those who stay with the same employer for longer tend to get good at what they do
7325698 itll only take 3 or 4 more jobs and youll be making 100k
7325699 superman returns didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
7325700 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
7325701 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
7325702 the sun remained obscured for no little time there was darkness greater than that of night no one could see where they trod and the starts shone brightly in the sky the birds moreover wonderful to say fell down to the ground in fright at such startling darkness amid the scream of women who cried that the last day of the world had arrived

7325719 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there

7325722 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
7325723 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
7325724 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose

7325743 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7325744 in total our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory
7325745 its become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports
7325746 you shall not make for yourself an idol or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth
7325747 a true image of god is not to be found in all the world and hence his glory is defiled and his truth corrupted by the lie whenever he is set before our eyes in a bisible form therefore to devise any image of god is itself impious because by this corruption his majesty is adulterated and he is figured to be other than he is

7325763 afirman que hab a talibanes en la regi n pero deben probarlo
7325764 alejan a la poblaci n del gobierno la gente est muy enfadada
7325765 la tragedia es mucho m s grave de lo que pensamos inicialmente
7325766 imag nense que estos candidatos de la oposici n que andan como locos que son los candidatos de bush del imperialismo ganaran la alcald a de petare ustedes creen que si ellos ganaran yo pudiera venir aqu a la bombilla no pudiera y mucho menos dejar an que las misiones siguieran trabajando en pro de las comunidades
7325767 ellos los candidatos del imperialismo no tienen proyectos para ustedes para las comunidades ellos son como fichas de un tablero de juego del juego de bush ellos de ganar dificultar an todo lo que hasta ahora han hecho las misiones para sabotear el gobierno de la revoluci n para decir que no sirven para eso es que quieren ganar s lo quieren derrocarme pero no volver n

7325772 ante el anuncio realizado por el presidente de la comisi n de desarrollo social integral de la asamblea nacional diputado oscar figuera y por el ministro del poder popular para el trabajo y la seguridad social robert hern ndez sobre la necesidad de presentar una nueva ley del trabajo ante la asamblea nacional desde el ctr unete celebramos esta posici n ya que hacer una reforma como la que estaba planteada desde el 2003 en la asamblea nacional no refleja la realidad sobre el trabajo hoy en el pa s
7325773 para este colectivo la nueva ley del trabajo debe convertirse en un instrumento al servicio de los m s d biles los trabajadores debe expresar el modelo econ mico que estamos construyendo en el pa s a partir de este proceso revolucionario y debe ser elaborada desde las propias bases del movimiento de trabajadores que somos quienes conocemos realmente este instrumento y sus debilidades
7325774 por eso proponemos una serie de temas que deben llevarse a la discusi n para elaborar las propuestas y convertirlas en proyecto para ser discutid en la asamblea nacional este debate tiene que ver con la caracterizaci n de la transici n que vivimos y con el programa de la clase obrera en tiempos de revoluci n
7325775 hemos visto desde el ctr unete algunos temas para ser debatidos
7325776 para nosotros esta es la oportunidad de hacer un gran debate nacional de cara a la construcci n del socialismo donde por primera vez la clase trabajadora tendr la oportunidad de participar proponer discutir y elevar el nivel de conciencia necesario para convertirnos en sujeto hist rico de este proceso revolucionario

7325904 thousands of chinese farmers face ruin because their water has been cut off to guarantee supplies to the olympics in beijing

7325910 hmm should one really put the bishop of llandaff in the same bed as lady kerkrade i wonder
7325911 i wouldnt the bishop tends to attract flies which will infect lady kerkrade the bishop is a bit loose in habit as well and will flop all over lady kerkrade also lady kerkrade is a gross feeder and needs plenty of top dressing i tend to fork manure in around her
7325912 but the colour combination works well surely ive always wanted a hybrid and the bishop of llandaff is a great cross pollinator
7325913 nah the colours clash lady kerkrade is a rather strident bathroom pink
7325914 keith may i have the file for the bcf27 variant project please
7325915 surely hes not going to start putting the dagger into the engineering workflow project now i cant tell you how much that has helped us hit our dates ok we cut corners and the it kremlin are hissing through their teeth but it does the job
7325916 its watertight a few bugbears here and there of course but theyll be ironed out and the users love it
7325917 may the lord strike him i dont like the way he looks at me as though measuring me up for my coffin
7325918 did you know that before admiral byngs execution they used the well tried method of sending in four men into his cell of roughly his height and starting a pretend argument about which of them all was the taller
7325919 muttered keith picking up the historical theme we fell into a brooding silence i removed the flower catalogue from underneath the strategy paper and began idly flicking through it it was no good though the light mood had been replaced with a weary gloom
7325920 dan stepford has just sent us an email with copies to half the human race criticising the engineering workflow system for being inadequate for their needs evidently it is not strategic
7325921 none of that all you need to do is observe
7325922 i havent read such a stupid email as yours for a year that is seven years in your time scale i reckon
7325923 dan you are entirely wrong in your analysis of the workflow system it has been signed off as satisfactory for use by your director after full user acceptance testing
7325924 look im sure we can sit down and work out these differences dan
7325925 i paused momentarily filling my lungs much as i did when i was the star of the local operatic society when my voice filled the auditorium
7325926 it is all down to information gathering and intelligence and lack of intelligence there are two rules in corporate life that are inviolate desperate dan forgot the first rule never to be forgotten by an ambitious manager that a torrid bout of after work lovemaking on top of ones bosss desk with ones bosss libidinous secretary may end up providing the wrong sort of visibility
7325927 sharon forgot the second rule if you really must indulge in a torrid bout of after work lovemaking with a er rising manager never describe the nuts and bolts of the experience in an email to your closest girl friends at work im sure she swore them to secrecy but this sort of email is dynamite especially as in it she revealed her pet name for dan a playful reference to his sexual desktop stamina from that point it was inevitable that the mail would be forwarded on and on through the email system and eventually turn up in the inbox of one of my contacts in the office intelligence network such is the power of email in our lives

7325930 the summer day was spoiled with fitful storm at night the wind died and the soft rain dropped with lulling murmur and the air was warm and all the tumult and the trouble stopped
7325931 the global economy is in a tough spot caught between sharply slowing demand in many advanced economies and rising inflation everywhere
7325932 the slowdown has reached such a wide range of countries that theyre now feeding on one another
7325933 the u k has been really soft for the last six months
7325934 western europe overall has been flat weve not seen the growth weve seen in the last few years
7325935 the year 2009 in europe is going to look significantly worse than 2008
7325936 it was too hot not to cool down as the song goes
7325937 a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year
7325938 its the rest of the world going down not the united states going up
7325939 exports have been sort of holding us out of the graveyard
7325940 that may begin to peter out a little bit if the dollar continues to climb
7325941 if the rest of the world economy slows the demand just isnt going to be there
7325942 when i see the headlines i worry but when i look at my order book i stop worrying
7325943 when china decides they want to build a car somebody runs a steel mill with coal and iron ore out of australia and they mine it with caterpillar dump trucks which are full of timken bearings
7325944 what is driving our success is the globalization of markets

7326042 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

7326071 the united states invaded iraq based on false premises the administration orchestrated a public relations drive to prove that iraq had weapons of mass destruction and connections to the 9 11 terrorists both proved false
7326072 whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors united states intelligence agencies and iraqi defectors led to the discovery that iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large scale biological weapons program and that iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated
7326073 to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons
7326074 my emphasis again capabilities and potential capabilities are mentioned but not ready to use weapons or even weapon programs much less large stockpiles of modern wmd
7326075 beginning in may 2004 isg recovered a series of chemical weapons from coalition military units and other sources a total of 53 munitions have been recovered
7326076 initially saddam chose to conceal his nuclear program in its entirety as he did with iraqs bw biological warfare program aggressive un inspections after desert storm forced saddam to admit the existence of the program and destroy or surrender components of the program in the wake of desert storm iraq took steps to conceal key elements of its program and preserve what it could of the professional capabilities of its nuclear scientific community
7326077 many locations associated with previous wmd programs and sites under monitoring by the united nations have been completely looted often there is nothing but a concrete slab at locations where once stood plants or laboratories
7326078 we cannot express a firm view on the possibility that wmd elements were relocated out of iraq prior to the war
7326079 isg technical experts fully evaluated less than one quarter of one percent of the over 10 000 weapons caches throughout iraq
7326080 saddam wanted to end sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction when sanctions were lifted
7326081 members of al qaida an organization bearing responsibility for the attacks are known to be in iraq
7326082 attacks underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of wmd by international terrorist organizations
7326083 necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations including those who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
7326084 pre war administration statements that iraq provided safe haven for abu musab al zarqawi and other terrorist members were substantiated by the intelligence assessments
7326085 postwar information supports prewar assessments and statements that abu musab al zarqawi was in baghdad and that was present in northern iraq
7326086 one of the reported contacts between iraq and before the war has been confirmed and two other meetings have since been identified
7326087 that iraq provided material support to bin laden and al qaeda iraq collaborated in or supported bin laden al qaedas terrorist acts of september 11 iraq provided materiel support to al qaeda and that it did so with knowledge and intent to further al qaedas criminal acts
7326088 iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations
7326089 to assassinate former president bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on united states and coalition armed forces
7326090 that threaten the lives and safety of united states citizens
7326091 to release repatriate or account for non iraqi citizens wrongfully detained by iraq including an american serviceman
7326092 on many thousands of occasions on united states and coalition armed forces engaged in enforcing the resolutions of the united nations security council
7326093 to use united states armed forces pursuant to united nations security council resolution 678 1990 in order to achieve implementation of security council resolution 660 661 662 664 665 666 667 669 674 and 677
7326094 statements by the president vice president secretary of state and the national security advisor regarding possible iraqi nuclear weapons program were generally substantiated by intelligence community estimates but did not convey the substantial disagreements that existed in the intelligence community
7326095 statements regarding iraqs possession of biological agents weapons production capability and use of mobile biological laboratories were substantiated by intelligence information
7326096 statements regarding iraqs possession of chemical weapons were substantiated by intelligence information
7326097 statements regarding iraqs possession of weapons of mass destruction were generally substantiated by intelligence information though many statements made regarding ongoing production prior to late 2002 reflected a higher level of certainty than the intelligence judgments themselves
7326098 statements regarding iraqi ballistic missiles were generally substantiated by available intelligence
7326099 statements that iraq was developing unmanned aerial vehicles that could be use to deliver chemical or biological weapons were generally substantiated by intelligence information but did not convey the substantial disagreements or evolving views that existed in the intelligence community
7326100 statements regarding iraqs support for terrorist groups other than were substantiated by intelligence information
7326101 statements that iraq provided safe haven for abu musab al zarqawi and other terrorist members were substantiated by the intelligence assessments
7326102 the president has authority under the constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the united states as congress recognized in public law 107 40
7326103 to take appropriate action in accordance with the constitution and relevant laws of the united states to bring iraq into compliance with its international obligations

7326150 but only because it is a gift bestowed by our lord to us out of his perfect wisdom and generosity
7326151 welcome you have been invited to the shores of love because you endured with courage and patience the turbulent seas that brought you here
7326152 it is for you that i crossed these raging seas fearing for my life along the way many times did i want to return and many times did i want the sea to take me its prisoner but i kept going there was one thing and one thing alone that kept my ship on course through those waves that kept me going do you know what it was
7326153 it was the thought of you and your love a love more precious than my mind could ever conceive my mind was made up i was going to get to you somehow because my heart had been made only for you and you know this is true because for an age my lord did make me wait for you made me risk my life to endure this love without you and crossed oceans just to be with you
7326154 that love without which my journey would have been impossible was a most wondrous thing indeed placed inside my breast each day i would visit this love inside my heart which my lord placed in a glass case surrounded by water pure and clean each day i would sit and gaze at it marvel at its beauty and each day i would ask it about you
7326155 i asked it oh love of my heart the one my lord placed here tell me about the one my heart seeks
7326156 tell me everything about her what she looks like and the things she likes the words she loves to hear the perfumes she loves to wear the colour of her eyes and the beauty of her hair tell me so that i may make myself worthy of such a love
7326157 if i were to describe her to you in everyway it would only burden you with a burden greater than you could bear
7326158 please oh heart of mine it is not a detailed exposition i seek but a mere glimpse
7326159 the merest of glimpses is what i shall give for that alone would suffice know that she is the fairest of the fair her skin radiant and her eyes set deep in an ocean of love when they gaze they do so like a lighthouse penetrates through the darkness her love shines through everything she speaks of gardens and flowers of running through meadows her hair streaming in the wind the warm air gently caressing her face she speaks of the nicest things you will ever imagine you can listen to her soothing voice until you fall asleep in her arms
7326160 my love you say the sweetest things from where did this love come to me on which fine springs day did its sweet fresh blossoms land on me
7326161 you my love are my greatest treasure for your lord has chosen you for me and i am your greatest treasure because my lord has chosen me for you could your love be the most perfect love
7326162 perfect only because it was made by the one that is himself perfect that love i cannot claim to be mine for it was given to me by the most gracious who placed it in my heart taught me its secrets and gave to me to share with you it is you that has inspired this love and kept it burning brightly as i sailed across those angry seas it was your face that kept me going that brought me to your doorstep and to the shores of your heart a thousand times i saw your face and a thousand more of your glances were captured inside me frozen in time i saw each one as if in slow motion a blessing was bestowed time slowed just so i could gaze upon your beauty for a moment longer i fall in love with you each time i see you with each look your loving eyes penetrate into my heart ever deeper they open the doors to its inner chambers sealed tight for so many years so many did try to open its doors but none had been granted the keys wherewith to open them this is my love for you the love i had kept contained for so long this is the treasure i bring more valuable than gold and all the precious stones in the world because for all their beauty they cannot comprehend love they cannot comprehend you or comprehend the one that unites that has united me with you

7326391 those that didnt like it i forgive them and god bless america
7326392 god bless the universe god bless japanese chinese indians all of them and lets have peace
7326393 moreover when you fast do not be like the hypocrites with a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting assuredly i say to you they have their reward but you when you fast anoint your head and wash your face so that you do not appear to men to be fasting but to your father who is in the secret place and your father who sees in secret will reward you openly
7326394 go gather all the jews who are present in shushan and fast for me neither eat nor drink for three days night or day my maids and i will fast likewise and so i will go to the king which is against the law and if i perish i perish
7326395 im never powerless because i can do all things through christ
7326396 but we have the holy spirit and he empowers us
7326397 indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
7326398 the syrians are making noise about the weapons deals to pressure the u s to provide sponsorship for the talks
7326399 t he syrians are hoping to use the talks with israel to gain more credit and strengthen ties with the u s
7326400 syria was planning to acquire the weapons systems a long time before the negotiations between israel and syria were resumed the syrians have been trying to do so for a very long time as part of their policy and this is not something new
7326401 so i cannot accept it i cannot really buy it
7326402 this is their policy on the one hand to support axis of evil countries like iran in their terrorist activities and to get more missiles
7326403 show themselves as willing to move toward a peace treaty with israel and convince the world they in fact accept it already
7326404 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
7326405 i think that syria is eager to get longer range missiles both ground to ground iskander missiles and also long range anti aircraft and long range anti ship missiles that will enable syria not only to threaten every military target inside israel but also to threaten israeli airspace and israeli waters from syria and this is of course the real threat
7326406 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east
7326407 americans can taste what it must feel like for every israeli mother and father when they send their kid out to school with their lunch to put them on a bus on a bicycle or to walk and they pray to god that cell phone doesnt ring
7326408 my son married a young woman whose mother is from a very prominent jewish family in the state of delaware the bergers
7326409 theres a rationale in my view why pollard should be given leniency
7326410 but there is not a rationale to say what happened did not happen and should be pardoned
7326411 when i was a young senator i used to say if i were a jew id be a zionist i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7326412 when the baker commission filed its report saying peace in israel is related to iraq i was the first and only person in congress to point out that if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq and conversely if iraq were transported to mars does anyone think there would not be terrorism visited upon the israelis every day
7326413 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community
7326414 throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons
7326415 sen biden was one of only four senators to vote against the iran missile proliferation sanctions act a bill that punished foreign companies or other entities that sent iran sensitive missile technology or expertise biden was one of the few senators to oppose the bipartisan 2007 kyl lieberman amendment labeling the iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization in a december 2007 debate biden said iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america on msnbcs hardball biden said he never believed iran had a weapon system under production
7326416 some of those blabber mouths and shouters who speak dramatically of the plight of the lower classes and the like are simply detached from economic data that have been formulated over the past half year
7326417 i want to say in the most friendly and correct matter there will be a debate today and it will certainly involve different voices and different opinions until the matter is decided
7326418 the fact that six israeli universities are listed among the top 500 universities in the world with the hebrew university ranked among the top 100 is most impressive especially when we take into account the size of israel
7326419 however without a solution to the acute crisis in which higher education in israel is currently enmeshed it will be impossible to maintain the status of israeli academia in general and that of the hebrew university in particular
7326420 was our moment to raise our heads from the exhausting daily struggle and promise ourselves and the world that the suffering of the palestinian people may be brought to an end and there can be a bright future for everybody in palestine after we get rid of the racist zionist disorder

7326495 the veiled woman is beckoning to me and all women to join with her and to leave our men behind the beam of light in the sky overhead is an alien space craft coming in for a landing just about a mile away she saw their arrival in her mind a clairvoyant since birth her sixth sense has made her an outsider on earth but not where the aliens live the plant in her left hand is an offering her third eye tells her that our otherworldly visitors will enjoy its fragrant scent her right hand placed gently over her heart she urges me and all woman to join her in that remote desert plain to assemble we can explore a world beyond ours men will destroy the planet she says to me know the peace that i know come with me for many days she will stay seated on a platform in the middle of the desert the lost and lonely females of earth will hear her telepathic call coming to bow at her feet then she will arise removing the veil and every woman will see their own face staring back for it has been their own decision all along she will lead us to the space ship and we will climb aboard metaphorically speaking well go to venus not to mars

7326498 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7326499 he suffered a small crack in one of the nose bones the bone was gently put back into place this morning under local anesthetic
7326500 old self particularly when events from the past are mentioned
7326501 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7326502 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof the contrast was all the more striking because shed always had a memory like a website
7326503 from the fateful day of our lunch telltale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7326504 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a frightening chapter in our lives i had to learn to be patient i also had to learn she had an illness and that it wasnt personal
7326505 thats the worst thing about dementia it gets you every time sufferers look and act the same but beneath the familiar exterior something quite different is going on theyre in another world and you cannot enter
7326506 hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7326507 it took us time to realise that couldnt remember a newspaper headline she had just read or what shed had for breakfast that morning but when a friend asked off the cuff oh margaret do you remember rationing he got a full ten minutes of my mothers best grocers daughters tips on how to jazz up tinned spam or powdered egg
7326508 between 1962 and 1967 two notes appeared in our mailbox there was a single sentence written on them i am doing fine but if those letters were really from my father i do not know
7326509 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7326510 senator obama had a great conversation with senator clinton this week as well as former president bill clinton everybodys on board
7326511 and its going to drive the media crazy when we come out of this convention united hillary clinton joe biden everybody that ran for this office is going to be united
7326512 you could fill your whole show with the nasty things that john mccain and mitt romney said about each other just a few months ago
7326513 the first person that he sat down and talked to at all about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton alone
7326514 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation
7326515 joes a guy who grew up in a working class household they both understand the experience that americans are going through now
7326516 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7326517 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter
7326518 monotheistic religions were sent by god in chronological order as a result it is unusual to go from the latest religion to the one that preceded it
7326519 i was forced to leave my family home where i have lived with my
7326520 my family has threatened me with death after the press published reports about the legal request i made
7326521 i never insulted islam i simply wanted my rights and wanted the state to treat me according to the belief i have chosen
7326522 my younger brother knew about it but since then hes been waiting for outside my building with a gun
7326523 now that unemployment inflation and growth are all worsening it is time for mr rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems
7326524 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7326525 i thought we were excellent in the first half and at the start of the second
7326526 once we got the goal there was only ever going to be one winner and im really pleased with the collective performance and the individual performances out there
7326527 i thought vincent kompany was excellent stephen ireland came in and had a real effect on the game so there are a lot of positives today
7326528 daniel sturridge got on the scoresheet so i was really happy with how it went today
7326529 i think we dominated possession and looked dynamic in our play
7326530 theyll look at the sending off as a turning point but i think we had the desire in our play and we showed we had the measure of them irrespective of whether they were down to 10 men
7326531 i didnt think we played that badly against villa i think we had a short spell where we let ourselves down and the game went away
7326532 but today we never allowed that to happen ive got good players here and were looking to bring in good players to help them so im happy with how its going
7326533 it was important to get a positive result today and concentrate on the football
7326534 they extinguished the fire and found him in his seat they got him out and tried to revive him
7326535 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7326536 we dont have any concrete information on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7326537 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7326538 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7326539 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7326540 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7326541 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7326542 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7326543 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7326544 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7326545 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7326546 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7326560 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
7326561 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores
7326562 de como se ofrecen las noticias taurinas en am rica
7326563 the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states joe biden
7326564 mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom
7326565 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington dc but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has
7326566 he understands whats going on in this economy he doesnt believe as john mccain does that things are fundamentally sound and weve made great progress when people are losing ground all the time
7326567 i think barack obama did exactly what he said he was going to do he picked someone who complements him
7326568 he picks someone who is of his own mind and will not be a sycophant and picked someone who is knowledgeable in the ways of washington because if barack obama wants to effect change part of doing that is having somebody with you that knows the institutions that you are changing
7326569 great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level
7326570 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation and especially the economy has come into the fore
7326571 joe is a guy who grew up in a working class household in scranton pennsylvania really understands what it is to have to scrap barack is a guy who comes from no means and no connections mother on food stamps when he was a kid

7326575 i think the two of them together would beat john mccain
7326576 in a week were not going to be talking about his pick hes going to be right back where he was in the polls
7326577 i cant give you an answer i dont think anybody else can
7326578 i frankly cant understand why and i assume he must have some reasons that are unknown to me but hes thought all the issues out and weighed all the factors and decided someone else is the best
7326579 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
7326580 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
7326581 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
7326582 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
7326583 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser

7326886 le parole con cui alemanno ha liquidato laggressione subita dai due turisti olandesi sono indegne per chi amministra linteresse pubblico con quale coraggio e con quale rispetto per le violenze patite dai due turisti picchiati e lei selvaggiamente stuprata si scaricano su di loro delle responsabilit quasi a insinuare che in fondo se la siano cercata raramente ho dovuto assistere ad un atteggiamento di tale genere
7326887 in ogni grande citt le guide turistiche indicano le zone da evitare soprattutto nelle ore notturne ovviamente questo non esime le forze di polizia dal garantire la sicurezza a chiunque transiti anche da quelle zone ma sollecita ogni cittadino e ogni turista a dare il proprio contributo apparentemente minuscolo alla sicurezza propria e di tutti

7326913 the christchurch city council is taking a hands off approach to a planned boobs on bikes parade in the city next year
7326914 it is distasteful and tacky and i will certainly not be going to stand in the street but it is clear that some people regard it as an intriguing and voyeuristic opportunity
7326915 i would much rather we did not have it in our city but what is clear is there is precious little local government can do to stop it it would be nice if nobody turned out to watch it and they just went away

7326938 fire yourself right away so you can hire people and focus on doing the things that you can do
7326939 too often you see entrepreneurs get hung up on doing the best job that they can instead of creating an environment where their employees can do better
7326940 i found myself 7 million in debt without realizing that it really was a colossally stupid deal
7326941 but the good news was that chris his younger brother had joined the company and we paid down the debt over the next five years and while it was a stupid deal it was also the best thing we ever could have done
7326942 you can be creative in your business without having a creative bone in your body
7326943 people get a kick out of getting a free bouquet and i remember people said thatll never work nobodys going to use the card
7326944 um you did read the postscript at the end of the movie about how he died in china as a christian missionary as an atheist how do you reconcile admiration for liddell with the fact that his faith is what fueled those attributes you admire or that his faith led him to his death
7326945 weve met tons of olympians over the years who wanted to do great and be great liddell wanted to be good and do good
7326946 ny summer 08 comes to an end its time for some heartfelt reflection
7326947 can i layer this over what im wearing to the airport
7326948 the whole thing is truly compact it could be put in a cell phone and it can use just sunlight for illumination which makes it very appealing for third world applications
7326949 our research is motivated by the fact that microscopes have been around since the 16th century and yet their basic design has undergone very little change and has proven prohibitively expensive to miniaturize our new design operates on a different principle and allows us to do away with lenses and bulky optical elements
7326950 we could build hundreds or thousands of optofluidic microscopes onto a single chip which would allow many organisms to be imaged and analyzed at once
7326951 an implantable microscope analysis system can autonomously screen for and isolate rogue cancer cells in blood circulation thus providing important diagnostic information and helping arrest the spread of cancer

7326953 when we started this effort it was the only way for us to be able to vote in denver to represent the people who elected us
7326954 were proud of what we did were going to see it to the end just like our candidate we dont quit
7326955 since we never consulted with senator clintons campaign we dont know if the petition that wouldnt die had anything to do with the two joint campaign announcements made last week we will probably never know but it certainly made us feel good
7326956 things to be known about the sunday interfaith event are this the dnc interfaith planner was contacted and asked if a non religous speaker could be included in the lineup among the christians jews buddhists and muslims this offer was either turned down or simply not replied to i dont have full details leah daughtry the dnc planner for this was questioned about this and acted as though having non theists at the event made no sense this can be taken that the non religious community has been snubbed plans for the sunday demonstration it starts as 2 00pm i plan to get there at 1 15 try to dress nice and plan to be respectful prepare to hand out flyers and hold signs if you want to

7326960 a few hundred dnc members cannot control the destiny of the democratic party if 18 million members refuse to cooperate passive resistence is the answer and casting your vote for anyone but obama is passive resistance
7326961 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7326962 obama is a crook and he is covering for crooks the two are not mutually exclusive in my view
7326963 i hate that he did it but its done and we won so dont rock the boat because it might bring the party down
7326964 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7326965 in the future it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee unremarkable to think that a woman can be the president of the united states and that is truly remarkable
7326966 we want to mark the 88th anniversary of women receiving the right to vote by honoring the milestone achievement of hillary clinton who has gone further than any woman in campaigning for the presidency
7326967 we saw a great deal of misogyny directed at hillary clinton and her supporters by the media and others

7326999 there are many things in life more worthwhile than money one is to be brought up in this our england which is still the envy of less happy lands
7327000 cold heart and bloody hand now rule the english land

7327004 they that have the power to hurt and will do none they rightly do inherit heavens graces
7327005 true heroism is remarkably sober very undramatic it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost but the urge to serve others at whatever cost
7327006 if heaven is about to entrust an important mission to a man it begins by filling his heart with bitterness and by confusing his powers of perception and overturning his plans it forces him to exert his bone and muscle it forces him to endure hunger and all manner of sufferings when the man emerges triumphantly over all these trials and tribulations he is then capable of accomplishing what would have been impossible for him to do before

7327017 we are uncertain of the extent of the legal jeopardy that apsa members might place themselves in should they make public arguments in canada or post those arguments online concerning hot button issues like homosexuality same sex marriage or the nature of the islamist threat to western civilization
7327018 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7327019 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7327020 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7327021 degrade and burn up on rentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
7327022 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station

7327026 we have to take care of the gfeller family and their wishes too but we have a football team i have to take care of and seven other coaches and we have to get ourselves back together and be able to get through this
7327027 there are 33 boys there and for every one of them there has been a different way to handle it like anything in grief there is a process but each one of them are handling it their own way and we will have to just help them through that
7327028 but you fall off the horse and you have to get back on it and thats what we will try to do and at the same time we will honor the gfeller familys wishes and keep the memory of matt alive in our minds and hearts

7327062 if one assumes that the neuberger berman subsidiary is worth somewhere between 9 to 13 billion the rest of the company is being valued at less than zero a valuation of this nature would only make sense if the company were to go out of business and then still owe money to its creditors which of course could not happen once it is bankrupt it is bankrupt
7327063 a deep pocket buyer would not be under any pressure to sell any assets it could wait until they mature it could sell neuberger for more than the value of the whole company and basically own lehman brothers for nothing

7327079 what happened in postville was an absolute travesty of justice that must never happen again

7327103 the use of sms has attracted a lot of interest from farmers because information can easily be accessed mobile phones are affordable to many people even in rural areas
7327104 on the tradenet website are more than 800 000 prices from hundreds of markets spanning a range of time periods and countries the price offers are available to search and compare over time and across markets and countries

7327107 many rural farmers in africa are illiterate sms is best suited to the delivery of short simple messages encoded in numbers short text or icons this rules out the delivery of complex technical information that would traditionally be delivered through training booklets and manuals
7327108 many farmers live below the poverty line and may not afford to pay for the information services thus missing out on the benefits

7327111 we are very excited to let gamers get their hands on fallout 3 the latest chapter in this beloved and highly acclaimed franchise
7327112 to meet the huge demand for this title by our fans worldwide we are planning one of the biggest launches of any game released this year
7327113 i first met michelle when she visited washington a few months ago
7327114 she reminded me of jacqueline kennedy like kennedy im predicting she will be loved and respected around the globe as a child i was inspired by john f kennedy and i see that same kind of inspiration coming from barack obama thats why i think hes the right choice its time for america to get new leadership
7327115 mr let me explain why i voted for herbie hancock for album of the year

7327118 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7327119 the question presented in this case is one of first impression in our court under what circumstances under the fifth amendment does an interrogation by law enforcement officers in the suspects own home turn the home into such a police dominated atmosphere that the interrogation becomes custodial in nature and requires miranda warnings
7327120 we reverse the district courts ruling that the interrogation in craigheads home was not custodial and that miranda warnings were not required craigheads self incriminating statements should have been suppressed
7327121 1 the number of law enforcement personnel and whether they were armed 2 whether the suspect was at any point restrained either by physical force or by threats 3 whether the suspect was isolated from others and 4 whether the suspect was informed that he was free to leave or terminate the interview and the context in which any such statements were made
7327122 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released
7327123 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7327124 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come through
7327125 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7327126 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired when i slow down
7327127 in the last 10 kilometers 6 2 miles it was unbelievable what the africans were able to do under these conditions
7327128 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7327129 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7327130 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7327131 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7327132 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7327133 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7327134 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7327135 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7327136 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7327137 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7327138 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7327139 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot

7327185 colorado is one of the most important battleground states that will decide the presidency as sen john mccain and sen barack obama slug it out nose to nose if the national election is close in november a handful of votes in colorado will be decisive
7327186 right now independent voters are split with 46 percent for sen mccain and 44 percent for sen obama
7327187 who wins the election may wind up depending on whether voters look inward to the economy and fuel prices or outward to world hot spots
7327188 the favorability ratings are significant because they show that mccain has made a good impression on voters even some who may not be for him at this point
7327189 its likely that between now and election day voter opinion will sway back and forth at the margins it would be surprising if obama did not enjoy some kind of short term bump from the convention being held in denver
7327190 the gender gap among white voters is a huge 14 points mccain is up 60 35 percent among men while obama leads 49 44 percent among women
7327191 mccains ability to contest the economic issue which voters say is their most important concern is key to his strength colorado voters give obama a narrow 47 43 percent lead when they are asked who can best fix the economy

7327195 some of my friends think im weird they dont understand why i love buses

7327197 but if were sick were not going to be zipping online to people who share an interest in photographing buses to help us get well well rely on our face to face friends
7327198 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7327199 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7327200 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7327210 jamieson did that very well but we wont know truly until they get back on the track for the next round
7327211 if we ended up fourth or fifth we could have had a very very difficult match up
7327212 this is a better match up it allows us to go out there and do what we plan to do without worrying about the other team too much
7327213 i am confident of the fact that this plan will give rise to a fruitful and constructive collaboration that is in the best interests of professional road cycling
7327214 in this regard and with the respect of the ucis democratic structures i know that i can rely on the indispensable contribution of all our stakeholders to relaunch and maintain a dialogue on the future of professional cycling
7327215 in more general terms these modifications are in line with the reform of road cycling launched by the uci in 2005 in that they favour the development of the sport of cycling to the benefit of all national federations around the world
7327216 the unanimous backing of this plan will also allow the parties involved to put an end to the various proceedings under way
7327217 this will allow the complete reintegration of the french cycling federation within the auspices of the uci

7327232 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7327233 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7327234 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7327235 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7327251 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7327252 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7327253 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7327254 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7327255 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7327257 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7327258 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7327259 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7327260 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7327261 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7327262 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7327263 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7327265 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7327266 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7327267 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7327268 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7327269 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7327270 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7327271 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7327272 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7327273 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7327274 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7327275 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7327276 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7327277 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7327278 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7327279 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7327280 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7327281 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7327282 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7327283 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7327284 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7327285 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7327286 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7327287 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7327288 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7327289 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7327290 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7327291 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7327292 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7327293 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7327294 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7327295 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7327305 according to preliminary information 20 out of 90 people on board survived
7327306 finally a bit after 8 45 p m a murmur went through the crowd st louis cardinals manager tony la russa and several other people weaved through the arena to their seats not even a minute later the lights went down
7327307 since the cardinals mid afternoon game contained a rain delay and ran for over three hours one wonders if the concert was delayed for tony its not out of the realm of possibility after all la russa is inarguably one of the citys biggest celebrities
7327308 a woman was flying from seattle to san francisco unexpectedly the plane was diverted to sacramento along the way the flight attendant explained that there would be a delay and if the passengers wanted to get off the aircraft the plane would re board in 50 minutes

7327314 tomorrow is going to be wonderful because tonight i do not understand anything

7327331 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7327332 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7327333 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7327334 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7327335 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7327336 ja ik moet het nog even na rekenen maar ik weet zeker dat je tot een voldoende komt
7327337 were not officially in a recession but we are in a slowdown and that depresses price growth
7327338 higher fuel costs are actually worse than a tax because when the gov ernment raises taxes to build a road it takes money from one part of the economy and puts it into another
7327339 at least consumers are getting something for their money that way
7327340 as prices go up inter nationally money flows out of the country and that depresses other parts of our economy
7327341 businesses and households have to compensate by cutting back their demands on other products
7327342 there has been immense pressure on producers not to pass on higher costs so that has restrained inflation
7327343 profit margins have decreased from a year ago because of the higher energy costs
7327344 if those prices stay down we should see higher profits in the third and fourth quar ters because when a business raises its prices it tries very hard not to lower them
7327345 the chinese sell us goods and earn dol lars if they used those dollars to buy american goods it would be inflationary to the chinese economy
7327346 one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
7327347 its great to get out on the road and win twice
7327348 its never easy to win on the road and both games we played were battles
7327349 to be interesting today technology has to be the fastest the best the brightest the lightest but here you can see if you sacrifice a little bit of capability and performance for dramatic savings in cost you can have a pretty dramatic impact
7327350 urbanmax is an innovation platform from intel this is a product ready concept
7327351 personal adjustment problems showing up in all kinds of places it was fairly clear that we were going to be seeing more of those things
7327352 were busier than ever and we havent had any recent publicity or visibility
7327353 and we havent seen the full bore of the housing crisis
7327354 you can really see how full your schedule is getting
7327355 financial stress job layoffs housing problems transportation all of which can complicate and heighten an already existing diagnosis of depression or anxiety
7327356 the standard percentage paid by the insurance company used to be 80 20
7327357 whose family is under such financial stress that she cant come anymore which is horrible ill reduce my fee but its the gas to get here theyre going down to one car and they cant spare the car
7327358 families where the main breadwinner is in the mortgage and housing industry are just being killed by this therapy is a luxury for every family
7327359 its harder to pick up the phone especially for those who have never been seen in the mental health system theres still a stigma add economic barriers and that takes it to another level entirely

7327368 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7327369 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion

7327379 san francisco schools earned bragging rights on state standardized tests again this year performing better than the state as a whole across every grade in both math and english but any celebration was clouded by the subpar proficiency of the districts african american students who continued to fall further behind their peers

7327406 but this is a qualified support as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7327407 but one reason influencing some christians may be what pope john paul
7327408 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7327409 a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
7327410 it has not been unknown for example for individuals to have to
7327411 ignoring this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself
7327412 i think the people who are hostile to europe need to open their eyes to the contributions of europe and those who are totally supportive of europe need to listen to the concerns and the reservations we need a respectful listening to the views of each side
7327413 because i know the part that irish politicians and civil servants and diplomats have played in framing this
7327414 im raising these subjects to have them debated in the cooler calmer

7327427 we feel lost in the big cities and its an alien habitat for us our ties and traditions are with our mother earth once we leave our lands our language and family structures begin to break down
7327428 without doubt were talking about a humanitarian emergency on a large scale
7327429 weve repeatedly denounced the presence of illegally armed groups and the state army on indigenous reserves who use our lands as a refuge or to hide in
7327430 they take crops and place communities in the line of fire theyve no right being there
7327431 in some cases different tribes are obliged to concentrate all under the same territory to survive something that endangers their own cultures
7327432 the fumigation of coca has forced some of our people to leave their lands and has caused illnesses among our children and women
7327433 were responsible for our communities in our autonomous lands but the government is not fulfilling its legal responsibilities to those whove been displaced or in the provision of basic healthcare and education
7327434 theres little political will to preserve indigenous cultures and alleviate the poverty that we suffer

7327610 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7327611 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7327612 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

7327623 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7327624 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

7327630 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7327631 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7327632 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7327633 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7327634 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7327635 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7327636 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7327637 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7327638 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7327639 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7327640 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7327641 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7327642 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7327643 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7327644 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7327645 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7327646 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7327647 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7327648 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7327649 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7327650 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7327651 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7327652 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7327653 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7327654 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7327655 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7327656 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7327657 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7327658 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7327659 to many it is not given to hear of the self god within many though they hear of it do not understand it wonderful is he who speaks of it intelligent is he who learns it blessed is he who taught by a good teacher guru is able to understand it
7327660 were learning what we need to do to win games
7327661 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7327662 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7327663 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7327664 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7327665 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7327666 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7327667 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7327668 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7327669 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7327670 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7327671 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7327672 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7327673 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7327674 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7327675 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7327676 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7327677 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7327678 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7327679 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7327680 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7327681 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7327682 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7327683 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7327684 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7327685 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7327686 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7327687 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7327688 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7327689 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7327690 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7327691 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7327692 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7327693 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7327694 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7327695 i think by the way theyre pretty relieved theyre playing with a joy in their step because theyve had that target on them for a while
7327696 were taking the ranking as something that hopefully helps us work harder and take it in a positive way
7327697 at times at night by myself i take it in a negative way when i think about how were going to meet all those expectations
7327698 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7327699 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7327700 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7327701 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7327702 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7327703 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7327704 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7327705 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7327706 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7327707 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7327708 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7327709 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7327710 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7327711 i will have to answer that for myself before i can answer it for you
7327712 i thought he said there wasnt much custom code needed
7327713 your battleships attack at 7 2 resulted in a hit

7327722 i just look at each one as an individual case
7327723 people have blogs that become very popular maybe blogging is just the activity of posting content to the web some blogs are journalism and some arent
7327724 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7327725 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7327726 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7327727 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7327728 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say

7327747 the bottom line is that technology is democratizing everything everywhere there is a gatekeeper an elite that used to make decisions on any given issue no longer has a monopoly
7327748 we were essentially held hostage i dont use that in a negative sense a really positive way
7327749 we were held hostage by their decision about who got in who got out and there was no recourse

7327782 that responsibility is with the school district not with us

7327821 many things occur in the world in which it seems very difficult for most of us to find a solid reason for acknowledgment of the hand of the lord i have come to the belief that the only reason i have been able to discover by which we should acknowledge the hand of god in some occurrences is the fact that the thing which has occurred has been permitted of the lord too many of us are inclined to think or lean toward the feeble thought that the illness that comes to us the afflictions that we suffer the accidents that we meet with in life and the troubles that beset us on our way in the journey of life are attributable either to the mercy or the displeasure of god sometimes we are prone to charge god with our afflictions or our troubles but if we could see as god sees if we could understand as he understands if we could trace the effects back to the cause and that truly by the spirit of correct understanding we would unquestionably discover that our troubles or suffering or affliction are the result of our own indiscretion or of lack of knowledge or of wisdom it was not the hand of god that put the trouble upon us the agency that he has given to us left us to act for ourselves to do things if we will that are not right that are contrary to the laws of life and health that are not wise and prudent and the results may be serious to us because of our own ignorance or of our determination to persist in that which we desire rather than to yield to the requirements which god makes of us

7327892 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7327893 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7327894 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

7327896 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7327897 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7327898 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7327899 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7327900 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7327901 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7327902 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7327903 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7327904 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7327905 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7327906 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7327907 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7327908 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7327909 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7327910 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7327911 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7327912 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7327913 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7327914 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7327915 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7327916 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7327917 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7327918 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7327919 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7327920 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7327921 this is a planning took where all things are going
7327922 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7327923 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7327924 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7327925 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7327926 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7327927 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7327928 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7327929 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7327930 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7327931 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7327932 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7327933 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7327934 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7327935 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7327936 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7327937 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7327938 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7327939 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7327940 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7327941 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7327942 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7327943 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7327944 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7327945 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7327946 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7327947 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7327948 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7327949 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7327950 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7327951 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7327952 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7327953 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7327954 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7327955 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7327956 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7327957 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7327958 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7327959 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7327960 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7327961 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7327962 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7327963 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7327964 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7327965 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7327966 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7327967 victory in georgia now gives russia the edge in the struggle over access to the caspian seas 35 billion barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of gas the probable losers the us and those western oil companies that have bet heavily on the caspian as one of the few regions where they could still operate with relative freedom at the core of the struggle is a vast network of actual and planned pipelines for shipping caspian sea oil to the world market from countries that were once part of the soviet empire american policymakers working with a bp led consortium had already helped build oil and natural gas pipelines across georgia to the turkish coast but after the mauling georgia got any chance of a new non russian pipeline out of central asia and into europe is pretty much dead says chris ruppel an energy analyst at execution a brokerage in greenwich conn
7327968 there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
7327969 biggest weak spot in his and his partys economic agenda
7327970 john mccains economic vision as he has laid it out during the campaign amounts to a slightly altred version of republican orthodoxy with tax cuts at the core
7327971 ever since wall street bankers were called back from their vacations last summer to deal with the convulsions in the mortgage market the economy has been lurching from one crisis to the next the international monetary fund has described the situation as
7327972 americans have still been buying but they have been doing so with debt a big chunk of that debt will never be repaid which is the most basic explanation for the financial crisis even after the crisis has passed the larger problem of income stagnation will remain its hardly the economys only serious problem either there is also the slow unraveling of the employer based health insurance system and the fact that come 2011 the baby boomers will start to turn 65 setting off an enormous rise in the governments medicare and social security obligations
7327973 i have spent much of this year trying to get a handle on what is sometimes called obamanomics and have come away thinking that obama does have an economic ideology its just not a completely familiar one depending on how you look at it he is both more left wing and more right wing than many people realize
7327974 15 years democratic party economics was the battle of the bobs on one side was clintons labor secretary and longtime friend bob reich who argued that the government should invest in roads bridges worker training and the like to stimulate the economy and help the middle class on the other side was bob rubin a former goldman sachs executive turned white house aide who favored reducing the deficit to soothe the bond market bring down interest rates and get the economy moving again clinton cast his lot with rubin obama told me a story about reich and rubin he was sitting at a conference table with rubin two seats to his left and reich across from him one of the points i raised obama told me is if you just use you bob and you bob as caricatures the truth is both of you acknowledge the world is more complicated by this obama didnt simply mean that their views were more nuanced he meant that both have come to acknowledge that the other man is in part correct
7327975 obamas agenda starts not with raising taxes to reduce the deficit as clintons ended up doing but with changing the tax code so that families making more than 250 000 a year pay more taxes and nearly everyone else pays less that would begin to address inequality then there would be reich like investments in alternative energy physical infrastructure and such meant both to create middle class jobs and to address long term problems like global warming
7327976 todays democratic consensus has moved the party to the left and on issues like inequality and climate change obama appears willing to be even more aggressive than many fellow democrats
7327977 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production obama told me and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally but he continued there are certain things the market doesnt automatically do in other words free market policy isnt likely to dominate his agenda his project would be fixing the market and it does seem to need fixing for three decades now laissez faire capitalism hasnt delivered nearly what its proponents promised it has created big budget deficits the most pronounced income inequality since the 1920s and the current financial crisis
7327978 obamas view the risks to market based capitalism now have more to do with too little regulation than too much he can sound almost righteous on this point he talked to me about the need for a moral element to capitalism and said that the crony capitalism of recent years should be the nightmare of any market loving economist at times this part of his message can seem to overwhelm his respect for the market obamas aides have justified his proposed windfall profits tax on oil companies for example by saying that it makes up for the unjustifiable tax breaks the energy industry has received in the past but that doesnt change the fact that its a tax targeted at a specific industry which as some economists have pointed out is just the sort of tinkering that the chicago school detests
7327979 the tax policy center a research group run by the brookings institution and the urban institute has done the most detailed analysis of the obama and mccain tax plans and it has published a series of fascinating tables for the bottom 80 percent of the population those households making 118 000 or less mccains various tax cuts would mean a net savings of about 200 a year on average obamas proposals would bring 900 a year in savings so for most people obama is the tax cutter in this campaign
7327980 top 0 1 percent by an average of 800 000 a year its hard not to look at that figure and be a little stunned but its also worth putting the number in some context the bulk of obamas tax increases on the wealthy about 500 000 of that 800 000 would simply take away bushs tax cuts the remaining 300 000 wouldnt nearly reverse their pretax income gains in recent years to put it another way the wealthy have done so well over the past few decades with their incomes soaring and tax rates plummeting that obamas plan would not come close to erasing their gains warren buffett an obama supporter
7327981 tell you his preference is let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7327982 the second criticism is that obamas tax increases would send an already weak economy into a tailspin the problem with this argument is that its been made before fairly recently and it proved to be spectacularly wrong when bill clinton raised taxes on upper income families in 1993 his supply side critics insisted that he would ruin the economy as we now know the fastest income growth most workers had experienced in a generation and the disappearance of the federal budget deficit his successor bush then did exactly what the supply siders wanted cutting upper income tax rates and the results were much worse
7327983 i asked obama whether he thought he had been able to tell an effective story about the economy during this campaign
7327984 good idea but shes an incorporeal dragon and the paint wont stick
7327985 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7327986 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7327987 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7327988 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7327989 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

7328069 while death and divorce may prevent it in too many cases the ideal situation for children is to be raised by a married mother and father proposition 8 is a positive step
7328070 they want people to feel like you are a bad person if you support what has been the definition of marriage since the dawn of time
7328071 are making the claim that if they can win they can hush the church silence the pastors and we will not be able to preach the truth as we know it
7328072 children in schools will be taught that same sex marriage is ok

7328075 i did it the hard way when i saw the draw i thought it would be hard but i got better and better and i believed
7328076 in my first fights i didnt really get out of first gear but i just wanted to get it over and done with because of the pressure if it had been anything else i could have relaxed a bit more

7328083 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities
7328084 there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7328085 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs

7328092 arabic music reached a high degree of development before harmony and the present system of european notation were developed
7328093 except in polyphonic music the development of european music has been mainly along vertical lines in arab music there is only one melodic line layed by several instruments in unison or octaves
7328094 it must be pointed also that the foundations of european music were laid to a large extent in the sanctity of the church whereas arabic music worldly and diverting flourished in the houses of the wealthy and the palaces of the caliphs

7328108 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars

7328111 i state the proposition accordingly that the images o the gods which are visible in the sky are from the divine models in the realm of mind and are engendered around them and having come into existence they are established around them and having come into existence they are established in these absolutely and being extended to them they have the likeness which has been produced from them they are likewise wrought into another arrangement after a different manner they are held here in connection with those models in one stable union and the divine spiritual forms which are present with the visible bodies of the gods exist separately before them but their noetic models unmingled and super celestial remain permanently by themselves all as one in their everlasting exaltation
7328112 the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handiwork
7328113 day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth knowledge
7328114 there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard
7328115 there line is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun
7328116 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race
7328117 his goin forth is from the end of heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof
7328118 for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of claves and of goats which water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people
7328119 saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you
7328120 moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry
7328121 and almost all things are bey the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission
7328122 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
7328123 for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but itn heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us
7328124 myths originally at least are structures of the human faculty of imagination which at some time were projected for certain reasons upon the heavens and may be secondarily transferred to the heavenly bodies with their enigmatical phenomena the significance of the unmistakable traces which this transference has imprinted upon the myths as the fixed figures and so forth must by no means be underrated although the origin of these figures was possibly psychic in character and they were subsequently made the basis of the almanac and firmament calculations precisely on account on their significance

7328230 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7328231 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental

7328233 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7328234 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7328235 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year

7328249 controversy is not the purpose of this thread for several reasons i think the bnp should change the partys name to the english national partry scots irish and welsh quite rightly have their own nationalist parties which are acceptable even to the establishment but these nationals are also british whenever anyone mentions british nationalism it is as though the black death has returned i have no idea why scots welsh or irish nationalism is ok but not british for much the same reasons i think we should have an english parliament the other brits can sit in our parliament but not vice versa it would not only ruff the collars of those politiciams who hate the english it may also be attractive to voters also in an english parliament british people would not be able to sit in it
7328250 also in an english parliament british people would not be able to sit in it

7328376 in my frantic times of trying to lose weight i sometimes skipped breakfast and tried to get through the day not eating much
7328377 i would go for a few weeks and bring an apple or an orange for lunch or go on vigorous runs to try and get fit im not a natural runner so it has always been a strain and of course it didnt work it would never last
7328378 when i finally came to my senses and realised i needed to do something about being overweight i found myself surrounded by a weight loss industry peddling nonsense solutions focused on short term weight loss rather than long term lifestyle change

7328394 i certainly dont think that we readers only or even chiefly enjoy or understand books whose main characters mirror us in fact the opportunity to become who we are decidedly not is one of the greatest gifts reading offers
7328395 you find the books you need when you need them even if theyre not the books you start out thinking you need

7328405 it truly is a sign of our times that so many members of klal yisrael do not realize the seriousness of the matzav
7328406 like the yetzer hara this man has charmed himself to so many people so that they are blinded to his true character the young people are so blinded by gashmius issues such as the economy and the iraq war that they forget that this man will likely pass resolutions that will allow lo aleinu people of the same gender to marry each other chas vsholom
7328407 i saw on the television at my doctors office how excited all the young people became in the presence of that man anyone who can stir up young people that way obviously does not have the best interests of klal yisrael at heart

7328487 recent claims made by the cfhs in the hill times which falsely stated that anglers hunters and farmers do not support senator brydens bill and are calling for stronger legislation
7328488 the cfhs its member humane societies and spcas and a clear majority of canadians including hunters anglers and farmers demand better legislation than bill s 213

7328498 animal rights activists have suggested that bill s 213 does not cover stray animals this was patently refuted by the senior assistant deputy minister at the senate committee who noted that section 446 1 a does in fact cover stray animals and does not require changes proposed by the animal rights community and bill c 373 as they are incorrectly suggesting

7328548 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of ten tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called

7328554 espresso is prepared and brewed under pressure so these espresso machines push water through a small amount of coffee at high pressure and so you are actually extracting all of the oils and essentials out of that coffee under pressure
7328555 whereas brewing coffee like you would do at home in a drip or french press you are letting gravity do its job
7328556 a cappuccino is an espresso based drink so the ratio would be roughly an ounce and a half to two ounces of espresso and about four to five ounces of steamed textured milk
7328557 one of the main reasons why is that extracting espresso takes about 25 30 seconds while drip coffee takes about four minutes
7328558 so you are spending four minutes extracting everything thats in that coffee which includes caffeine and you are doing it for a far longer period of time

7328669 and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit
7328670 then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun
7328671 therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit
7328672 for god giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up that he may give to him that is good before god this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
7328673 again i considered all travail and every right work that for this a man is envied of his neighbour this is also vanity and vexation of spirit
7328674 better is an handful with quietness than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit
7328675 there is no end of all the people even of all that have been before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
7328676 better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity and vexation of spirit
7328677 behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit

7328735 sms threats secret video tapes and rm60million in anwars hand
7328736 i just wanted to say i am thrilled with joe biden as my vp the conversations weve been having the last couple of days make me absolutely convinced hes the right man for the job hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans hasnt forgotten his working class roots hes got the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that may come up more importantly i think he can help shape a long term strategy to make america more secure and move us out of the disastrous economic and foreign policy that have characterized the last eight years
7328737 i am very excited about the convention i cant wait to hear michelle speak tomorrow i will tell you that i did get a little preview of the video they did of her and she was extraordinary and i think you guys will enjoy it very much and im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully itll make clear the choice that the american people are gonna face in november
7328738 shes fully vetted and i dont think that process has occurred with barack obama
7328739 of all the people running for president ive been the most vetted the most investigated and my goodness the most innocent
7328740 made himself a multi millionaire after he entered public life
7328741 everytime i see a post from you obama supporters all i can think of is how i wish i had some swamp land to sell why dont you start thinking for yourselves and stop regurgitating everything you read and hear
7328742 obama the new senator for illinois and his wife michelle were flush after signing a 1
7328743 say americans think most people in presidential politics are wealthy and will point out that obama made himself a multi millionaire after he entered public life
7328744 mccain folks will of course repeatedly hammer at the notion the biden pick
7328745 so what are you expecting from obama if hes in office not that the other puppet is better
7328746 and as you know the senator has some positions that dont go along with the catholic church
7328747 the bishops conference has left it to the individual bishops to decide how they want to handle it
7328748 its kind of appropriate that the almighty god placed him here today because sen biden is here
7328749 as you know he has just received a new appointment and how could we not know about that the senator has received this appointment as we understand because of his expertise in foreign affairs
7328750 its nice that he gets a little educating this morning about some of the needs of our church and the community as well in south india
7328751 that he may find increased wisdom and strength as he becomes more involved in the presidential campaign as candidate for vice president
7328752 she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7328753 the best thing they could do was play great volleyball they cant control what had happened and probably are going to try to comprehend the magnitude of that event later but what we can do is try to play the best we can
7328754 i thought that was a real good way for them to deal with it im very proud of their approach and their maturity
7328755 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job
7328756 then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7328757 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7328758 we did our best but the best was not enough
7328759 she gets it she was certainly one of the major proponents of me coming back and finishing what we started all those years ago
7328760 ela parece estar nos seus 30 anos esta a turn mais agitada dos ltimos tempos principalmente like a prayer

7328768 everyone has to learn so that they can one day teach
7328769 do not let the sun go down while you are still angry
7328770 it isnt a question of whether an illness is physical or emotional but how much of each
7328771 yes but i never could do anything to treat his anger
7328772 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7328773 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7328774 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7328775 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7328776 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7328777 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7328778 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7328779 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7328780 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7328781 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7328782 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7328783 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7328784 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7328785 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released
7328786 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7328787 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7328788 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7328789 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7328790 there were already individual cases where sherpas were invited to work in mountain huts but illegally and they were caught and the cabin manager was penalised because they were here without a permit
7328791 so they came to me because ive spent a lot of time in nepal and know a lot of people there and asked if i could do something
7328792 the prerequisite is that they work in the trekking business as a guide in a lodge or as the owner of a lodge
7328793 when you travel around nepal you can tell now which lodges are managed by people who were in austria from a hygiene point of view from the way theyre managed the cleanliness theyre just better
7328794 now its okay but at the beginning it was very hard
7328795 i think its really about the money to be able to feed their family
7328796 at first they dont want to use these new clothes they want to keep them in brand new condition to bring them home
7328797 what i get here is big money in nepal its small money
7328798 for them its like winning the lottery after three or four months theyre going home with 5 000 euros thats 450 000 500 000 nepalese rupees
7328799 theres a sense of continuity they learn more that way and its better for the hut owners if the same person comes again because he or she already knows how the place is run what needs to be done and doesnt have to learn from scratch
7328800 i just want to help these people ive been to nepal so often and had so many lovely experiences so i want to give back a little of what i received
7328801 i feel very close to these people and i have a sort of helpers syndrome
7328802 left to right top row first irish cream triple chocolate cinnamon sugar chocolate vanilla cinnamon sugar vanilla vanilla polkadots cupcake factory on 29th and rio grande awesome cupcakes
7328803 monotheistic religions were sent by god in chronological order as a result it is unusual to go from the latest religion to the one that preceded it
7328804 i was forced to leave my family home where i have lived with my mother and daughter
7328805 my family has threatened me with death after the press published reports about the legal request i made
7328806 i never insulted islam i simply wanted my rights and wanted the state to treat me according to the belief i have chosen
7328807 my younger brother knew about it but since then hes been waiting for outside my building with a gun
7328808 whatever young guy comes by for a date were going to have one of these mean looking guys who dont crack a smile theyre armed theyre dangerous

7328810 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
7328811 i think obama and biden together can absolutely help us win colorado
7328812 the west has changed since 1992 its changed a great deal the independents in the west are really looking for leadership
7328813 this year the road to the white house runs through the west
7328814 theres so much in our regional economy of construction development tourism hospitality agriculture in which immigration labor is vital
7328815 and a lot of people realize that closing the border is going to lead to significant changes in things like food prices and food availability
7328816 weve seen the democrats put a lot of interest in trying to win nevada colorado and new mexico theyve sunk a lot of resources into
7328817 we will see who wants to be part of this and then we will get a manager that everybody will be happy with
7328818 and i know alex ferguson has been approached by seb coe and i have spoken to him about it
7328819 i think the whole of the country will want when the olympic games is held in britain and theres a football tournament where the final is held in britain they will want us to have a team in the competition
7328820 this is an extraordinary blunder by the prime minister particularly leading up to the by election in glenrothes
7328821 what does he think the people of fife would think about putting at risk the future of the scottish football team
7328822 the fact is that gordon brown has become so obsessed with his british campaign he has lost touch with reality
7328823 this is not a popular idea not only do all the national supporters associations oppose this but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team
7328824 gordon brown has scored an own goal of spectacular proportions by promoting this daft idea on the eve of a vital scottish by election
7328825 im not sure they the different national associations would allow it
7328826 countries have their own identity their own patriotism it has been mooted for a number of years by fifa at the world cup that great britain has a team it would be impractical in that sense scotland northern ireland wales even england all have their own identities so i dont think it is a starter
7328827 implican un enorme n mero cuando extrapolamos el resto de nuestra galaxia
7328828 en el centro de la galaxia estos filamentos estelares se acumulan y simplemente se observa una mezcla uniforme de estrellas
7328829 pero cuando se observa m s lejos se comienzan a detectar hilos individuales as como algunos rasgos m s parecidos a montones de pasta que provienen de galaxias enanas que se encontraban en rbitas m s alargadas
7328830 el poner las piezas todas juntas a representado un gran reto
7328831 porque la corriente que proviene de una galaxia enana puede enroscarse alrededor de la v a l ctea y pasar a trav s de corrientes de estrellas arrancadas de otras galaxias enanas
7328832 el sdss nos ha ense ado mucho sobre la v a l ctea y sus vecinos
7328833 pero todav a estamos reci n comenzando a cartografiar la galaxia en un modo comprehensivo y hay todo un tesoro de descubrimientos all afuera esperando por la nueva generaci n de prospecciones incluyendo a las dos nuevas inspecciones de la v a l ctea que ser n llevadas a cabo por sdss iii

7328930 the only problem i have had since doing sensing murder is a phone call at 1am from a male who talked about one of the cases

7329346 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7329347 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7329348 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7329349 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london

7329355 i loved last years releases of the ladera cabernets and the same holds true for this years releases this single vineyard offering hits just the right balance between soft supple approachability and structured seriousness the fruit notes recall blackberries and black cherries with nicely subtle edging from spicy oak the tannins are notable but ripe and rounded in texture enabling this to work well with food in the near term or develop additional complexity during cellaring for another five or more years

7329389 we are not forcing them to come here they come of their own free will seeking the glorious freedom that only we the superior society of america can and does offer
7329390 look at this this human being chose to defect to our nation he chose to abandon his former government and to embrace our government at peril to himself this proves that our society our government and our form of government is truly undeniably superior to all other governments and worthy of unquestioned support and patriotic loyalty from all citizens
7329391 wonderfully free open and gloriously democratic with freedom of religion freedom of the press etc

7329394 well im remonstrated outdated i really want to be over rated
7329395 the internet can be helpful story about girl who sent emails to media during fay
7329396 i wonder if churches do to people what zoos do to animals i love the church i bleed the church and im not saying that the way the church cages people is intentional in fact it may be well intentioned but too often we take people out of their natural habitat and try to tame them in the name of christ we try to remove the risk we try to remove the danger we try to remove the struggle and what we end up with is a caged christian and the cage opens when we recognize that jesus didnt die on the cross to keep us safe jesus died to make us dangerous praying for protection is fine but when was the last time you asked god to make you dangerous i would like to think that when i pronounce the benediction at the end of our church services i am sending dangerous people back into their natural habitat to wreak havoc on the enemy
7329397 im not convinced that your date of death is the date carved on your tombstone most people die long before that we start dying when we have nothing worth living for and we dont really start living until we find something worth dying for ironically discovering something worth dying for is what makes life worth living
7329398 some of us live as if we expect to hear god say well
7329399 can i share a growing desire in my life i dont want to do things i am capable of doing why because then i can take credit for them i want to see god do things in me and through me that i am absolutely incapable of so i cant possibly take credit for them
7329400 i have come to this conclusion i dont want to be good at lots of things i want to be great at a few things i would rather pour my heart soul mind and strength into a few endeavors than do lots of things halfway
7329401 when teddy roosevelt was president he and his naturalist friend william beebe would routinely go outside after dinner and look up at the night sky
7329402 in the 1870s an annual church conference was held at westfield college in illinois during the conference the president of the college prophetically said we are approaching a time of great inventions for example i believe the day is not far off when men will fly through the air like birds one bishop present accused him of heresy the bible tells us that flight is reserved for the angels the bishops last name wright his two sons orville and wilbur recorded the first successful powered flight at kitty hawk north carolina on december 17 1903 where would we be if it werent for children who challenge our assumptions
7329403 faith is not logical but it isnt illogical either faith is theo logical it does not ignore reality it just adds god into the equation think of it this way logic questions god faith questions assumptions and at the end of the day faith is trusting god more than you trust your own assumptions
7329404 i dont want to live my life in such a way that the best i can do is the best i can do frankly my best isnt good enough when i fail to pray the best i can do is the best i can do
7329405 in the words of c s lewis when a man is getting better he understands more and more clearly the evil that is still left in him when a man is getting worse he understands his own badness less and less if you understand that youre getting better if you dont you arent
7329406 we are the most resourced church in the most resourced country the world has ever known you know what is most lacking good old fashioned guts we need people who are more afraid of missing opportunities than making mistakes people who are more afraid of lifelong regrets than temporary failure people who dare to dream the unthinkable and attempt the impossible
7329407 in the first century church was anything but a safe place it was a dangerous place there is nothing remotely passive about being part of the kingdom of god we are called to forcefully advance the cause of christ faithfulness is not holding the fort faithfulness is storming the gates of hell
7329408 when did we start believing that god wants to send us to safe places to do easy things god want to send us to dangerous places to do difficult things and if you chase the wild goose the mysterious god he will lead you into the shadowlands where light and darkness clash
7329409 jesus never promised safety or certainty or predictability and he certainly didnt die on the cross to tame us he died to make us dangerous he died to invite us into a life of spiritual adventure
7329410 quit living as if the purpose of life is to arrive safely at death

7329449 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7329450 inside the stadiums things have gone very very well reporters seem very pleased with the number of press conferences that were held and the degree of access they had to officials however outside the stadiums we have confirmed more than 30 cases of reporting interference heard of another 20
7329451 there is a fact that there were 77 applications thats what we have been told we found it unusual that none of these applications have come through with protest
7329452 that to us is an indication that it is not free access for humanitarian supplies or assessments through our non governmental partners were able to get to many parts of georgia but we need access so roadblocks make it difficult for humanitarian assistance to get through to people most in need
7329453 what concerns us is that they pulled out some of their troops they maintain at least eight checkpoints across the region and another eight or nine in the western part of the country including areas which have never been part of any conflict zone areas where there has never been any russian military presence including peacekeepers

7329481 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7329482 the achievements we have made in this olympic games are a very important driving force for the future
7329483 is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression

7329531 the second one was bigger than the first one it took a half hour to get it on board we took our time we didnt want to lose it
7329532 michael moore has endorsed you but he recently said fill in the blank with some outrageously offensive line taken out of context will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
7329533 i just want to study and be with my mom
7329534 a lot of guys try to run the same game that they ran over there but they end up falling on their face
7329535 you see we know spanish but we dont know the exact words and when we try to explain to somebody something theyre like huh
7329536 they shouldnt have deported you so soon after your surgery
7329537 i cant walk both my feet are in bad shape
7329538 finish high school and then you can come here at least here you have your grandparents your cousins over there what do you have
7329539 they deport them at any hour at 10 p m at midnight and in some cases they wind up in the street or they sleep in the offices of mexican immigration agents
7329540 to try our best not to bring women or juveniles after dark
7329541 i dont know how but im going to make it
7329542 its a noble thing that they want the family to be reunited but they are exposing them to danger
7329543 i just want to go back to michoacan with my mom
7329544 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7329545 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7329546 barbarians thats what they are they kill innocent people here how many kilometers outside the battlefield they bombed all over georgia
7329547 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7329548 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7329549 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7329550 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7329551 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7329552 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7329553 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7329554 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7329555 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7329556 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7329557 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7329558 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7329559 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7329560 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7329561 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m

7329568 all of your profits depend on your customer yet most marketers dont have a real understanding of their customers wants and desires do you know what your customers want
7329569 oh no i cant sit in the sun ill burn up
7329570 why is direct connection to beings in other dimensions a natural ability for a few people and yet seemingly impossible for so many others
7329571 i am still disappointed i cant tell you that i am not disappointed not because substantively its a big loss because we are getting that same pick in 10 months its a delay and i dont have time for delays i need this team to be good as fast as possible delays are always setbacks having said that last year we were among baseballs leaders in signing draft picks we were again going to be this year i dont want to go through the blow by blow again there is no point to that but we really stepped up to make aaron crow at the 9th pick the highest paid pitcher in the draft it probably wasnt warranted but we did it anyway we offered it anyway for whatever reasons i will let him and his agents explain what their thinking was i couldnt tell you because we were never allowed to talk to aaron crow so i really couldnt tell you what the thinking was from the other side
7329572 again big picture wise its not a necessarily a loss to us we still have that same pick its not a money savings we need to disabuse people of that notion this was not done for money we still have that pick and we still have to pay that pick 10 months from now so there is not money savings here we had the fallback we had the plan b this is what the draft system was designed to do as negotiated with the players expressly for this purpose so some errant agent could not come in and try to hold some one up for ransom at the top of the draft and that is why the players union negotiated with management to say ok if you dont sign your top pick you get that same pick next year to forestall this exact same thing from happening and why that usually works is because the player has no fall back
7329573 i know what our fallback was we have the same pick in 10 months i dont know what the players fallback was and thats kind of sad
7329574 well that is why this sort of got out of hand this year because that was done last year with one case at the top of the draft this year all the agents said lets copy how that was done you know what it kind of worked for a lot of picks who got 6 million contracts even though the first time a bonus like that was ever given was last year at midnight so a lot of agents played that game and it actually worked in some cases
7329575 ok what does that mean for next year this is rapidly going to become an impossible situation if you just say yes to everything you cannot operate that way you cannot operate that way and we certainly wont
7329576 both sides file an email we send an email in and there are no problems there there is even a few minutes after the deadline when the paperwork is being filed
7329577 once again if you are a big picture person which i must be you recognize we lerner kasten ownership has only been here two years since july of 06 there has been an awful lot of progress made in two short years that really is not a lot of time that is a short amount of time to make the progress we have made i think we can already see and i will let you do this work you can already see the lineup you could project for 09 just from the people we have here now ok that is starting to look like not only the youngest team in the league but a pretty darn respectable team and pretty darn respectable defensively i have some optimism about them offensively as well and younger pitchers being here now you can do that work yourself sbf because i am not going to talk about who is going to be in the lineup come 2009 but i can already see the people who are here
7329578 its coming its here as i said i have been in this exact spot before and had the naysayers criticize me before but i dont know a shorter or quicker way to do it to be good and be good for a long period of time
7329579 i think its an above average defensive team which is a great start because all of a sudden your pitchers are better they are getting to the balls in the gaps and the holes sbf yeah and all of a sudden your pitchers are better and that happens to mirror my own experience in my history in the game
7329580 anderson hernandez is the same thing we are putting those all important pieces i think together you take a look at our starting nine for 2009 thats your homework but they have to show up and be healthy i dont know what else to do if nine other guys have to play if our nine backup guys have to play again that wont be a very good team but if our nine starters play we will be alright
7329581 i never know if that is fair or not i know the energy around a team that is winning is better than around a team that is losing its kind of a chicken and egg thing we all can i think hang on a little to how things felt that first week of august all of a sudden the clouds cleared and we saw light at the end of the tunnel unfortunately it was followed by these past 11 games but i dont have any concerns about energy i think that when we work out the things we need to work out when we get the players we need to have back here the wins will come and energy will be there right along with it
7329582 moral is better when you are winning sohna we dont have any particular moral issues we dont have any particular clubhouse relationship problems we dont have those types of things still in all i will tell you there are a lot of examples of teams with bad relationships in the locker room that could still go out and win so that sometimes is overplayed when the game ended last sunday august 17th manny pulled them in and his message to them was guys you are playing hard you need to continue to play hard and you need to be optimistic and upbeat he wasnt screaming he was trying to encourage them manny continues to encourage lets remember for now this is the youngest team in the league and i think at this stage they still need more of that encouragement than the other stuff yelling and screaming while still demanding the work and the effort that we must have
7329583 it is true it is true shaking his head back and forth in amazement he is a believer in the gospel of optimism as i would call it and that is not an act from manny there is nothing phony about it that is how manny is
7329584 yeah for those of us who are still fans it would be hard to understand someone not having fun playing baseball come one if nothing else you should still be having fun playing baseball no matter what the circumstances are up here in the major leagues
7329585 i dont worry about him big picture hes had a tough season i think he has had a tough season the first time he has ever had this type of injury again once we turn the corner we will be able to look back on this and i would like to say laugh but you never want to laugh about it everyone chuckling but we will understand that it was a part of the building process and all the teams that are good now i think you can look back now and see where they were they all went through this pick a team they all went through this all the teams recently good and by the time they all got good no one was thinking about those tough times anymore i know that so that is what we have to keep focusing on
7329586 its true there is no question about it listen there is nothing that has happened this season that has set the long term back at all its been a good year in the minor leagues not just record wise because i dont go by records in the minors that is not the most important thing it is nice that our records now are good in the minor leagues but what is most important is the development of individuals that is what the minor leagues are for
7329587 do yourself a favor as you are mentally filling out your 2009 lineup here major league club fill out your 09 lineup in columbus do it yourself and tell me if you dont have a full team of guys who are available to step right in or are about to be the next wave do it yourself and i think you shall see what i am talking about
7329588 no we knew our first focus would be on pitching brother we are really deep on pitching over the next three to five years we have some corner people that are coming but we were short in middle infield i think we have shored that up now with the two trades we made mid season up here emilio bonifacio amp alberto gonzalez and now for anderson hernandez now we have backups and people to fill those positions and we have guys coming whether its ian desmond followed right behind by gonzalez you have probably followed the kind of year he is having now it takes time i wish it didnt take time that would make my life a lot easier but this just takes time
7329589 no question about it we have to think of that you have to think of that i am intrigued by what arizona has tried to do in the last year did you know in the last 12 months they have given up 20 prospects twenty a it speaks to the depth of their organization to begin b i presume it means they are working hard to replenish because you cant be doing that very long and get away with it that is an interesting way they have gone about it to win now they still only have a 500 team roughly right yes that is true sbf but they are in a division where that will work
7329590 but no question that trading prospects down the road has got to be one of our potential avenues to succeeding
7329591 yes but he is not the only one obviously they have traded 20 guys oakland did a pretty good job taking guys from them cincinnati got guys from them they keep doing that it works for what they need

7329609 in the 1990s the gazan fishing industry produced an annual income of around 5m that had halved by 2007 and is still shrinking fast under the oslo accords which in 1993 were supposed to herald the coming of an independent palestinian state gazan fishermen were to be allowed 20 nautical miles out to sea where they could catch sardine as they migrated from the nile delta up towards turkey during the spring but israeli naval ships in recent years have imposed their own much reduced limits sometimes fewer than 6 miles out
7329610 what gives israel the right to take away the livelihood of these fishermen and why does the world allow them to destroy an industry that used to provide for thousands of palestinians
7329611 we intend to challenge that right backed up by warships and machine guns just as we challenged israels right to prevent us from coming here on saturday

7329615 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7329616 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad

7329776 under the circumstances it is difficult to avoid the impression that the cia and other intelligence agencies defended themselves against the dangers of attack from the bush administration through a process of self censorship
7329777 the net impression is that the cia white paper was rewritten to conform to administration preferences if so u s intelligence a priori made itself a tool of a political effort vitiating the intelligence function and confirming the presence of a politicized process
7329778 the specific analytic failures on iraq intelligence become much less significant in such a climate especially in that they all yielded intelligence predictions of exactly the kind the bush administration wanted to hear

7329787 i never believed ike leggett and other faux liberal democrats would join the march to turn maryland into the next amusement park for gambling
7329788 its a betrayal of the racial minorities who are preyed upon by this pathology of hope this belief that youre going to turn your life around with a single bet
7329789 so many democrats who pretended to be opposed to state sponsored gambling turned out to be only against the republicans who were pushing for it now when an african american political leader comes out and legitimizes the exploitation of vulnerable constituencies it gives permission to people who dont need much of a push to dismiss those populations
7329790 my dream ticket would be obama and clinton preferably clinton first but seeing as thats not likely to happen now then id like her to be second together they cover a vast group of voters from all demographics
7329791 i supported clinton because of her economic and social security policies
7329792 i am a youth hispanic who supports hillary which is a rather rare demographic
7329793 everything that she has done and stands for is similar to what i aspire to be like its a great honor to represent the youth in denver as a national delegate
7329794 im excited about seeing so many big people im really excited about seeing how politics work on a national level as compared to the state level and local level im a little worried about the amount ofprotestors police that i saw in denver yesterday i hope that the speech at invesco field goes well and the weather is nice im also happy to be able to go to several events where i can possibly meet lots and lots of new people
7329795 my thoughts on biden he will add a lot of experience to baracks resume as a candidate however i feel that hillary would add just as much experience that senator biden does i also think that biden wont really help out a whole lot with crucial states whereas i think hillary would guarantee a big state like new york and greatly affect others like pennsylvania ohio and texas i understand that you shouldnt pick a vp based solely on the fact that they will help sway more states and win an election but there must be a reason or several for that matter that that person can and will sway those states as disappointed as i am that hillary wasnt his pick i think that biden will serve the u s as the vp well

7329797 i was so disappointed in yesterday after looking at the film i decided to do it again only this time tackle
7329798 so we played every snap live and i was very pleased with the attitude this time i was pretty mad with the team yesterday but i feel better now i think it was pretty good medicine for everybody
7329799 i felt like i was doing the guys disservice not to play full speed football the biggest disappointment was you couldnt evaluate we didnt know if we were ready or not
7329800 if he doesnt come back for this game maybe well get him for the next game its a long season and he has a long career ahead of him
7329801 hes not out of the race for no 2 ill say this too dontavius jackson has been coming along i wouldnt think anybody is out of the race for playing time
7329802 if everybody was playing base football we would be feeling it more than we are now
7329803 i thought i did some good things i thought i made some mistakes
7329804 i thought there were some plays we made that were big and kept the ball moving good and bad well look at the tape and get better into next week and heading into the regular season
7329805 we wanted to get matt in as many different situations as we possibly could through this process he threw the ball efficiently didnt really get any long throws down the field i thought he operated well against a very physical football team theres a learning curve well got back and watch the tape and see how our entire football team did but i thought matt did a nice job for his first start
7329806 i need to make two better throws in the red zone in the first half and try and get the ball on roddy white on the second one to get the ball in the end zone
7329807 there were some plays we made that were big and kept the ball moving
7329808 gods in charge hes the one who decided i got sixth today
7329809 when somebody wants to talk about the word im going to talk
7329810 i passed up too many opportunities to speak on the word in the past
7329811 we even had discussions where we went back to the room and argued about what things in the bible meant
7329812 for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always
7329813 we looked at the bible and googled on the internet the hebrew translation we were able to get a better understanding of what the verse was saying
7329814 if you look at a lot of the verses when they translate the words are changed
7329815 the original scrolls were in one language and then it was translated to greek or aramaic or some other stuff so you can have meanings lost in translation
7329816 to meet michael for the first time just to see his heart for the word and see him develop and blossom was wonderful
7329817 you never want to try to force anything on anybody thats not how its done
7329818 i might say hey man were having fellowship feel free to come hear the word and apply it in your life its non denominational nobodys trying to get anybody to join anything
7329819 we are not bible freaks so to speak that everything that comes out of our mouth is quoting scripture because that is a turnoff it is bible studies
7329820 i just want to strengthen my relationship with god and learn more about him
7329821 mike went off to the advanced class in ohio and he wanted us all to get the same thing he got
7329822 i couldnt work out the entire offseason before his junior season
7329823 when we get hurt thats just temptation for us to doubt god and his word you let it roll off like water off a ducks back as my mama used to say
7329824 it got deep into everything you could think of every year i go home and i talk to cartersville seniors and i tell them everything about me is because of michael how i got in contact with god
7329825 teammates have seen what happened with me i could have redshirted my sophomore or junior season after surgeries but i wanted to help
7329826 were sitting down here now with about 50 mph winds and power out in half of our town and they say its going to continue through tomorrow night
7329827 we cant load up the buses with kids in that weather
7329828 when i first got here im thinking i want to be like david pollack
7329829 then this year dough boy fernando velasco leaves so i get my old high school number back ok im back in 75 and on the offensive line and in high school i played on the left side so it really feels natural to me it feels good
7329830 he had a great shot of being a great end
7329831 but they needed him and he made the switch he sucked it up and did what he had to do for the team that right there makes him a great player
7329832 every day as soon as he got here he was saying to me you need to be on the o line you need to be on the o line once i made the move over he congratulated me
7329833 without him here right now wed be spinning pretty hard
7329834 hes a super athletic guy hes real fast and quick hes just got to learn to harness that to play left tackle hes working hard at it and doing good weve got to keep plugging away because its kind of a new deal for him i think hell be fine
7329835 hes a prototype a very good prototype for that position as was trinton
7329836 i think everybody is going to be able to relax and have a good dinner tonight
7329837 i havent been doing the best with two strikes so to have that at bat was nice
7329838 i told him it was the at bat of the year
7329839 i was just sitting on deck amazing at what he was doing
7329840 that was huge and prado is playing with a groin pull
7329841 when the scores 15 1 its easy to get down and try to get the game over it was good to see the guys still putting out the effort to do what it takes to win a close game
7329842 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7329843 the smiths brought me in dan reeves brought me in theyre gone
7329844 the front office is gone the guy that brought me in ron hill is up in new york in the league office ive always been prepared for this moment
7329845 i knew i wasnt putting that bird on my helmet anymore it was very clear to me from the way things were going i enjoyed coming back i didnt have any mixed emotions or any wrong feelings
7329846 opened the door they gave me an opportunity and im forever thankful
7329847 i dont have any resentment toward anybody thats currently in this organization period
7329848 i tried to practice some of those days and that guy wouldnt let me
7329849 there were days i started to feel really good and he wouldnt let me
7329850 does he give anybody a reason did he give you a reason when he took off
7329851 they have a good defense better defense a stable head coach something i was looking for somebody i could talk to somebody that knows football the nfl
7329852 there are some of the parallels between mike vick and quarterback vince young i knew i was going to a situation i could help i wanted to help fill a need throughout training camp throughout the entire offseason its been great
7329853 im a dedicated person dedicated to this school im committed to this school
7329854 im hoping to close this chapter of my life on a high note
7329855 when we took him to an outside doctor people there got upset
7329856 it definitely wasnt one sided at all there was a lot of miscommunication both ways
7329857 one thing i told coach johnson if i was such a trouble maker if i was so out of control on the field i would have been out of control in the classroom
7329858 coach johnson being the good man he is gave me a second chance
7329859 i believe in giving guys a chance until they show me differently
7329860 like i told him hes on a short leash the first sign i see of anything thats not team oriented well have to sit down i havent seen that
7329861 i felt like i failed entirely being here in my hometown it was kind of embarrassing with my friends and my peers around i felt my reputation had been ruined
7329862 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7329863 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7329864 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed

7329867 i just got tired of hearing people say to me over and over yeah i was watching it but i missed one i got really confused and i stopped watching it
7329868 if you start going out with someone and immediately theyre like look we have to see each other every week you run from that person
7329869 the evolution from your ideas and expectations and intent to what actually occurs in the series is a massive gulf

7329876 all the feedback im getting is that harry will be fine
7329877 the democratic ticket has made theirs the party of words with the scripted eloquence of the presidential nominee and the errant ramblings of the vice presidential
7329878 theres not one person on this club who would say its not embarrassing the way weve played the last three weeks
7329879 its not embarrassing those games happen occasionally but weve got to make better pitches our young guys too many bad games to the number of good games we cant go out there every game down five runs
7329880 its a little bit of everything everything negative and very little positive that kind of thing sets the tone for the rest of the game
7329881 when i tried to bear down i just couldnt find it i couldnt locate the pitches
7329882 weve got to stop the way were playing weve got to tomorrow this is just unacceptable were just not playing good baseball right now top to bottom
7329883 its starting to snowball and we have to stop it now
7329884 this is something that is unique for our program georgia is no 1 in the country and obviously they are a talented team our fans are fired up we all want to see how were going to do against that caliber of competition
7329885 when an sec team comes to your place its a big deal
7329886 we took those guys right down to the wire before we lost
7329887 it hurt to lose but it made us a better team
7329888 once we play georgia we will get a good sense of what we need to do if were going to beat usc
7329889 southern cal has a big fast defense that is what we expect from georgia
7329890 the teams that win this league play great defense and usc looks like an sec team when it comes to their defense
7329891 they have the huge linemen like georgia who can run very fast if we can block georgia then well have a chance against usc
7329892 there are a lot of factors that go into a sack
7329893 some times there are breakdowns on the offensive line but other times i just held the ball too long and the sack was my fault ive worked on getting rid of the ball sooner
7329894 when i got here in 2007 i found that a lot of the pressure on rudy stemmed from the keller situation
7329895 i think sometimes they put too much on him to win the game weve tried to take some of that off of him
7329896 once weve played them weve played one of the best teams in the country
7329897 i dont think anybody we play is going to be better than georgia
7329898 he looked at us and said mom dad i want to go out for the football team
7329899 i dont think thats easy when your parent is your teacher its either going to be great or its going to be not great
7329900 but kevin is a good teacher and drew is a good student and it turned out to be a perfect situation
7329901 i was trying to see what i would look like in a duke blue devil hat or a wake forest deacon hat
7329902 im very happy for him i think he landed where he should have been
7329903 my dad never pushed me to play that was probably the good thing about it
7329904 as i kind of grew up i was moving toward punting as a natural ability most of the comparisons kind of fell off statistically hopefully ill get to do my own thing as far as punting goes
7329905 i took that in stride and i worked hard and ive worked hard ever since
7329906 the coaches redshirted me last year for a reason and now they want to know what ive got im just working hard to prove to the coaches that i can be the guy
7329907 which is always adventurous because me and my dad arent the hunting kind
7329908 russia has leveraged its status as peacekeeper to assert increased control over georgias separatist enclaves while the u n and organization of security and cooperation in europe osce worked to reach a final settlement in south ossetia and abkhazia the international community including the united states engaged russia as a mediator rather than a spoiler in the peace process indeed russia has gained more by perpetuating these frozen conflicts vis vis georgia than acting as a good faith party to any final peace
7329909 the die may have been cast for democratic vice presidential candidate joseph biden chairman of the senate foreign relations committee when russian forces invaded georgia this month once the tanks rolled the weight of evidence shifted toward someone who would raise no question in the area of national security
