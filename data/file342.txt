3420019 exercise physiologists say the conventional wisdom about age and sports is more urban legend than fact not only were there dara torreses in the past these experts say but they also predict that stories like hers will be more common in the future the reasons are an infusion of money into many sports combined with improvements in sports medicine and training exercise researchers cite athlete after athlete who competed at ages when conventional wisdom said they should have been washed up even sprinters who are widely believed to reach their peak performances in their early twenties and decline a few years later have defied expectations in fact said jos gonz lez alonso director of the center for sports medicine and human performance at brunel university in britain the notion about sprinters peaking early might have no basis in science in the last century there were sprinters like donald finlay of britain who came in fourth in the 110 meter hurdles in the 1948 olympics at age 39 more recently the sprinter merlene ottey competed in seven olympics including the athens games in 2004 and won a total of eight medals she turned 48 in may of course it is not easy to keep competing year after year

3420070 we find that a lot of companies are not reaching their potential in terms of cost reduction so there is that opportunity there to start looking at cost structures and theres a variety of ways of doing it
3420071 thats something that companies should really be looking at on an ongoing basis not when times are hard the problem is when times are good that always gets off the radar for many companies so thats one lesson to learn
3420072 the fact that there are a lot of opportunities and with things looking cheap theres a tendency to rush because these are like bargains its like walking into a shopping centre and everything is on sale and you end up trying to buy everything

3420089 im no longer there in those dilemmas of israeli arab palestinians
3420090 this issue of belonging and acceptance accompanied me for many years along with this confused generation to which i belong and i reached the conclusion that there is no reality in all this issue of the arab israeli as a palestinian it is not anchored anywhere if their basis is only land day and 1948 then thats not enough for me suffering the pain of the expulsion doesnt turn me into a palestinian that identity crumbled for me wheni realized that there is a declaration here she is refering to the israeli declaration of independence ij that defines me as a citizen of this state when i say state of israel i feel part of it
3420091 because after all there is not being created here an arab culture or debate or employment what is this palestinian identity that is so fondly spoken of they stand up against one wall and they dont see whats on the other side and there is another side i say to them to perhaps let go of all those walls and try and see whats on the other side its much easier to be a poor wretch and and inferior and sick and with one arm and blame everyone to create a vision is far more difficult if we had half your herzl everything would be different its not as if he was some great wise man he was just a journalist we need to bring someone with a vision ask any palestinian what his national dream is and he wont be able to give you any answers
3420092 it is convenient for a lot of people to define everything as fate
3420093 i want to refute this we believe in fate but we dont know what the fate is so one must behave as if there is no fate you cant drive while drunk destroy a family and then say it was fate

3420098 but the webcomics community is this tight little group of old timers who always show up with the same opinions and the same agenda and while the number of webcomic creators is growing by leaps and bounds the webcomics community is drastically shrinking
3420099 no the webcomics community is not shrinking this sounds like a misconception cooked up by people who have the webcomics community confused with the small fraction of the webcomics community that reads a particular blog just because some people dont go to certain restaurants doesnt mean they dont eat
3420100 i disagree with the premise that the webcomics community is one and the same as those guys who just keep talking about webcomics you dont have to be obsessed just to write draw or read webcomics i think some people perceive shrinkage because their own clique is shrinking modern tales inc is not the hub it was a few years ago the cultural current of webcomics seems to flow more through the smaller groups like dumbrella dayfree boxcar blank label and kazus crowd groups bound more by friendship and common taste than by common interest
3420101 i believe that what is happening is that there are multiple
3420102 creators with professional attitudes about their comics often come to recognize the community as largely worthless and frequently destructive to our aims
3420103 the trend does seem to be toward several dozen people dominating debates throw a rock at a webcomic website and youll hit artist a making fun of artist b who is making a complete ass of himself who will then fall over and collide with artist c who means well but seems to be on what i would call the exact wrong side of every issue and who has a real penchant for the high horse whether or not hes wrong insofar as the community is stagnating in terms of discussion areas i pretty much entirely fault this crowd i respect a number of you guys pretty highly but for christs sake it doesnt even make sense from the outside anymore webcomic artists in general need to crawl out of their own asses im not interested in this shit and neither is most of the readership which is why their numbers may grow while contributions to discussion shrink every time artist b substitutes a gay joke for an argument the webcomic community shrinks a little
3420104 the community isnt necessarily where people think it is anymore
3420105 were so used to the internet not having gate keepers that weve failed to notice all the gates being built dumbrella dayfree keen modern tales these are all special cases and we cant use them as a cross section of the community you go out into satellite areas linked by dayfree press members or webcomics nation you get a completely different idea of the community and this is where i look for good work now
3420106 ryan norths my number one resource for cool comics and his circle is the one that interests me most

3420122 many factors are involved in the present conflict but the central one is straightforward the majority of the ossetes living south of the main caucasus range in georgia wish to unite with the ossetes living to the north in an autonomous republic of the russian federation and the georgians regarding south ossetia as both a legal and an historic part of their national territory refuse to accept this
3420123 the hostilities between russia and georgia that erupted friday over the breakaway province of south ossetia look in retrospect almost absurdly overdetermined

3420133 one of the reasons he is so useful to not only pittsford but also monroe county new york state and even other states is because of he is a champion for the fire service if there is someone in need for something whether it be an individual firefighter or a fire department up in the adirondacks barry is there to help

3420159 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3420160 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump

3420162 im honored to know a person like tom ridge who had every opportunity after he graduated from harvard not to go to vietnam
3420163 he could have found a doctor that would have given a certificate that he had a bad knee but instead he went and decided to serve his country during the vietnam war and he came back here to erie
3420164 thats the kind of people that this part of america produces
3420165 call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking get him down there and get him to work

3420474 my view is that the united states if we had a stronger relationship with russia we could exercise strong diplomacy to stop this effort against georgia we should immediately go to the united nations security council condemn russias action and then get the security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint and possibly at the same time generate some u n peacekeeping troops the problem though is that we dont have the kind of influence and strength in our relationship with russia to persuade them this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
3420475 lets go to the unsc where russia can be convinced to condemn itself

3420533 the city decided to stop apologizing for the desert and said we live in the desert it is what it is
3420534 we have seized 15 to 20 barrels at a time
3420535 they have a very shallow root system and can be popped out pretty easily people have been digging them up in broad daylight
3420536 in some cases the thieves work for landscapers and in other cases they are independent contractors who sell the saguaro to legitimate commercial operations
3420537 depending on the size and shape or if it has arms they sell for anywhere from 500 to 5 000 or more each
3420538 once or twice a year we encounter people with shovels and pickup trucks trying to steal cactus
3420539 you can see the cumulative impact of 60 years of this kind of thing along some park roads where all of a sudden there are no barrel cactus
3420540 we dont have a problem with thefts anymore maybe because we have armed rangers patrolling everywhere
3420541 these are probably worth 150 or 200 each i think the economy is driving a lot of this if it isnt nailed down they are going to take it
3420542 we are trying to be in the forefront of water wise planting and are cutting down on our lush vegetation a lot of people are getting away from lawns and turf in favor of desert landscaping a golden barrel 3 or 4 feet across is worth 4 500 or more you pay by the inch
3420543 there has always been plant theft but now it has escalated
3420544 it has increased because a landscaper has a job to do and with the slowdown in the economy he may look for cheaper prices i have heard that some of these thieves sell plants on street corners now

3420574 for the same reason that the members of the state legislatures will be unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach themselves too much to local objects
3420575 the legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex
3420576 a universal peace it is to be feared is in the catalogue of events which will never exist but in the imaginations of visionary philosophers or in the breasts of benevolent enthusiasts
3420577 t he government of the united states is a definite government confined to specified objects it is not like the state governments whose powers are more general charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government
3420578 a just security to property is not afforded by that government under which unequal taxes oppress one species of property and reward another species
3420579 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents

3420585 you are not able to serve the lord he is a holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your rebellion and your sins 20 if you forsake the lord and serve foreign gods he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you after he has been good to you
3420586 you are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the lord

3420594 continuing tightness in supply versus demand and tightness in spare capacity

3420623 how do they come to any sort of artistic consensus
3420624 they kick it around sometimes they kick a thing to death and thats okay certainly theyve been doing that with carl sandburg theyre not americans theyre european so its a little different sandburg doesnt intimidate them like he might a group of american adolescents who grew up with sandburg in classrooms i brought them here not to just understand carl sandburg but to develop some kind of take on america most of them have never been to the states
3420625 what does tilting at windmills have to do with carl sandburg
3420626 everything and nothing actually i think theyve given up on carl sandburg and thats okay too

3420634 you have had the opportunity to know both anglo and blackfeet artists its obvious that anglo artists have more opportunity to expose their art to the art world or at least that part of the art world that is economically inclined to attach sometimes enormous value to a work of art rc gorman would have been one example of a native american artist who broke this barrier is this a racial discrimination issue or is it simply hard to get noticed
3420635 as for anglo artists having more opportunity than indian artists i would argue the opposite being a romantic indian is an advantage in the arts
3420636 working in bronze seems amazingly difficult not too many people are doing it or can do it well
3420637 you are perfectly situated in paris to find out about the beaux arts school and the great shift from marble sculpture to bronze sculpture which made work like rodins possible also the work that is related and key to bobs bronzes is that done by the animaliers a set of sculptors who specialized in portraits of animals usually pretty ferocious but also domestic animals rosa bonheur and barye are two favorites of ourselves this shift to bronze is related to war the expertise gained in the making of weapons especially cannons there is a strange symbiosis between cannons and monumental bronzes one is forever being melted down to make the other
3420638 personally i find the big spaces of the american west to be intimidating why is so much of this particular sculpture focused on images of the american west
3420639 its mostly timing the expertise and american foundries arrived with the opening of the frontier and the need to celebrate the civil war heroes more recently there has developed a new kind of casting that is much easier and cheaper we used the old fashioned roman block method but this modern ceramic shell casting which gets slightly less admirable results is everywhere now small foundries in unexpected places
3420640 the techno revolution has the art world shrinking or shrieking some people would say expanding but i would say its shrinking its becoming more ubiquitous like publishing its so about mannerisms theres more edge in pornography than in the world of art in fact it was the landscape of porn that imbued the internet with technology that worked
3420641 contemporary public art is almost entirely an abstraction why do you think that this form of art attracts more controversy than traditional public art that is more realistic than surreal the cinematheque video that the nea had such a fit about was public art it just wasnt public art that necessarily portrayed america as a great and shining city on a hill
3420642 i think its turning back the other way the great abstract contemporary movement of the first half of the 20th century is now retreating though you wouldnt know it from the mainstream magazines art of the west or southwest art and a few others document a plethora of realistic bronze monuments across the us we seem now to be reconciling the abstract with the realistic maybe because of the amazing technologies of image which are often so trompe loeil forcing us to reflect on what is real and what is an illusion or what we want to see
3420643 cowboy art seems very male gorman broke with that tradition
3420644 its true that his motif and trademark was the navajo woman with her chin in the air
3420645 its so distinctive that there have been new yorker cartoons about it but his secret was excellent contacts who were interested in promoting him dont mistake me he did fine and unique work but thats not the same as marketing
3420646 could an artist with this kind of background who defies tribal tradition ever return to the reservation isnt the loss of his presence a loss for the tribe
3420647 tribes are not romantic they are cut throat competitive both between each other and within their reaction to gorman probably depends on whether they see him as competing with them or being a possible sponsor i never heard of him sending money back to his tribe navajo politics are as vicious as any and he may have felt he was well off to have escaped
3420648 he got a lot of those contacts in san francisco mary is talking about when he was the most famous nude model around he was navajo and he was usually nude when posing so both were pretty authentic those were the early years
3420649 i cant say or predict that my grunts will side with sandburg america as a kind of muscle might sound visionary to an american i doubt that it sounds too visionary to them america the workhorse and the train and abraham lincoln and pride or a singular nobility through work may be american themes that american culture wants to reflect upon itself but im not too sure that is how the rest of the world reflects upon america actually if im going to teach them about america i would indeed bring them here
3420650 how do you think they see america the american story
3420651 i note the use of two words that keep popping up in their discussions one is brutal and the other is ruthless i cant say sandburg would have necessarily disagreed
3420652 yeah well if youd gotten into the cowboy art scene youd have found that the dealers werent cowboys artists are products galleries are businesses
3420653 isnt there a cultural disconnect between indians selling art on the sidewalk on blankets and white gallery owners making big percentages
3420654 dont underestimate the indian in a blanket he may be making as much money as a gallery at home he may not wear a blanket at all the image of the poor primitive indian sells art
3420655 the disconnect here is more a matter of east and west the big money and the fancy galleries are owned by easterners both cowboys and indians are product theres a weird and possibly sick little dynamic here where a wealthy professional often a doctor or lawyer adopts an artist and controls him rarely her alcoholism often is part of the dynamic the professional helps the artist by acquiring the art for low prices or even nothing then storing it until the artist dies young and the value assumedly goes up
3420656 in europe art schools are everywhere are there art schools on reservations
3420657 just the regular public schools but the reservations have tribal colleges that might have big art departments the thing is a school imposes standards and one of the hallmarks of real indian art is improvisation in materials and unique vision you cant go to school for this it comes from confidence and the ability to really see
3420658 many white europeans see indian art as more craft that real art how do they go wrong in assuming this why do they assume this
3420659 those nutty germans try to become indians because it was a big part of a national philosophical back to nature movement they admire 19th century objects which are art because the indians decorated everything in their lives but they were defined as crafts sort of collectibles thought to be primitive everyone always thinks that their own art is higher and realer than that of someone else anyway the modern indian art movement has assimilated the abstract art of the twentieth century and at least in the western us has absorbed many asian contexts and givens which is quite un euro
3420660 how do you get brutal and ruthless from a place like this this is seriously nature
3420661 you note the disconnect between a place like this and whats just outside a place like this
3420662 north carolina and all of its military and racist glory sandburg did go to the conflicted lincoln sandburg did go to the depression and the agony but america sees what it wants to see and what it sees is someone not too controversial whose work they can bring into american classrooms to bore the fuck out of everyone
3420663 tim ignores them but they come with a certain sadness attached
3420664 they think intimacy has to be sex sometimes its just intimacy america seems to have a real problem with it i think people are jealous of tim hes our teacher and its called a relationship
3420665 the poetry video theyre putting together between the sandburg shoots has to do with tilting at windmills
3420666 you used the metaphor of the windmill in your my derelict hotel poems as timoth e le tallec
3420667 i tried but i couldnt avoid the tours they get deadly serious about how much money theyve invested in you lawsuit is always thrown around as a reference point i hated the tours i had to do them with broken hips crutches wheelchairs and an assistance dog navajo would sit under tables on stages people always liked her more than me i got a blood clot on a flight during one trip and ended up hospitalized at unc hospital where i was fighting for my life and medical staff was definitely confronting me on who i really was i dont know who everybody is i dont believe in the idea of an everybody my literary critics would have you believe that is what they are literary critics but i know who they are i know what they are some of them were gay men who were and are outraged that i turned out to be someone who isnt actually one of them the anger there is pretty horrific ive left the le tallec stuff it was attracting too much attention with where will he turn up next my derelict hotel wasnt even finished and i had to leave it because of the attacks the morocco material in terms of what these people scream about once again turns out to be stuff americans who hate sex and assume everyone but them is having it go after it was harder to find you to get to you to shut you down before the internet now if american culture doesnt like you and youre coming to the internet as a different culture with different values the americans can shut you down they own it they dont seem to understand that a metaphor can be poetic too i dont know why the reactions are so intense or mean there but i dont think they teach much poetry in america the nea claims it has a vast reach into classrooms but its laughable no child left behind and testing has a vast reach into classrooms the neas reach isnt even symbolic the nea who i tangled with or the people there went behind my back to web servers and considering the fact that in this post 911 world web servers view governments with dread and governments are now imbued with a certain anti terrorism gravitas its easier to take down the offending poetry than it is to engage the poet in a face to face confrontation this is government censorship by intimidation this is the new censorship you dont know its happening your work just disappears writing sex is so much more threatening as an idea than portraying it literally everywhere on the internet they can get away with putting it into the same context they put terrorism only this would be a cultural terrorism real sex or straightforward porn doesnt have a whole lot of new ideas but poetry does there are things i have to assume here and one is the old idea that a poet has to leave the states for whatever reason and can flourish more creatively in a place like tangier and it is not an accident that tangier is a muslim environment you would leave the freedom of american democracy for a muslim country to create art and art they think has to do with sex so yes i would assume a pseudonym here why because vindictiveness is powerful it doesnt just rest or stop with the nea people read genocide and think im paranoid but i am more than convinced i know that the same people who pretend theyre actually literary critics have two voices one is the voice that follows me around on the internet like a rabid little dog at my heels and this includes the academics at the nea who use the power there to maintain a certain academic status quo the other voice is a harassment they dont want you to know about it could be and has been harassing a web server it can be and has been personally harassing my kid on the phone it can be and has been an attack on my computers and i can document that too but to who my computers were supposed to be overloaded with so much viral incoming that theyd simply shut down that was the goal so what i do is simply forward everything all around the world with a variety of servers and not to obfuscate as i use my name but to protect my software with so many filters at every checkpoint and then on to the next checkpoint that to date anyway has blocked most of the incoming i still typically get a hundred thousand hits of junk mail that i never see when this doesnt shut me down they go for the jugular apparently according to prevailing logic i am supposed to take the we are going to kill you and your pets and your family stuff as an annoyance but when its so consistent and has lasted not days or weeks or months but years its not periodic its something you cant say how youd deal with it until it happens to you one way ive dealt with it has been to change my identity so then the outrage becomes hes committing identity theft identity theft is taking an established identity not establishing a new one sometimes you feel so underground you feel buried if they cant shut you down they will simply bury you it seems to be the american way most of my work is buried i go underground i dont know how you can continue to look forward and create new work at the same time youre always defending your existence from people who are literally no metaphor going after your life from three steps back in the past you call it tilting at windmills i call it survival im embattled the people in my life are embattled
3420668 theres a lot of tilting the cameras focus both personally and at cinematheque
3420669 actually from what ive seen of the animation no one is tilting at the windmill what ive seen is that the windmill is totally destroyed by helicopter gunships that appear to be very very american its adolescent but so are they war and violence has had a dramatic impact on what they see as artists what theyre really struggling with is this thing they have to share as filmmakers and even more than that as poets and storytellers and that is the conflict between hope and hopelessness that does speak to american culture im not really sure were here to get carl sandburg sandburg was more embattled than i first understood when i came to where he lived the evidence for that is mrs sandburg everything about connemara can sustain itself if cut off from the world this was the 1950s and all the anti communism hysteria if what the cinematheque crew comes away with today is just their little animation about how windmills are destroyed by the destroyers or the helicopter gunships or an anonymous military they have constructed with their drawing and art thats okay with me sandburg will have provoked them what really touches me personally like a fist shoved up my ass is that theyre adolescent boys writing poetry when i first said carl sandburg they rolled their eyes oh there goes another old geezer who wants us to do the work of old geezers when what we want to do is animation there he is imposing the past on us when what we want to do is address the future but i know something they dont know yet there is no future without a past one does not exist without the other maybe well fail at this sandburg film i can afford not to care theyre adolescent boys with everything that means about culture and chaos and theyre writing poetry theyre putting that poetry to video you tell me where the failure is in that
3420670 how easy is it or how hard is it to write and get a book published today that deals with american art in the american west
3420671 depends on the book mine which is very atypical has been hard to get published people expect big picture books which they buy if they cant afford the actual art or to show off how important their art is publishing is not about art publishing is about marketing
3420672 is there a difference between how open mainstream publishing is versus the way in which smaller presses are in terms of their willingness to publish for the audience who would read such a book
3420673 i dont think there is such a thing as mainstream publishing anymore
3420674 who are your readers and do you hear from them
3420675 im only hearing from a few people i have many more readers of my blogs often the people who respond to the book have a personal connection with bob this book of mine is meant to remain useful for many years because it contains so much art history and i dont think there will be a lot of response until word of mouth has gone on for a long time
3420676 even if that flux is bogged down with convention weve got one guy nino fabriano who is fourteen from florence doing adolescent anime when ninos training is as an artist and the kid is talented has been pointedly traditional
3420677 the kid came to me to get away from the suffocation of the past i think all of them right now are feeling some of that by being here the idyllic setting is sheer bullshit i find it quite amusing that the rushes ive seen of their windmill being bombed by a military gone berserk are created in part by dutch boys one of whoms brother is in iraq i like the fact that the past is so oppressive to them maybe its because the past is oppressive go figure theyre the future the tragedy would be for them to come away from this experience with the attitude that poetry itself is a dead thing its not and theyre not fighting me on it anymore or they would have slapped some rock and roll on their video and they didnt do that the music video is the past as well theyre reinventing something im not sure what it is but i am sure i would never in a million years tell them they cant make what theyre making because it doesnt keep its coloring between the lines the people in poetry will tell you that video poetry is a poet reading his work to a camera they would laugh at that they want poetry to explode and maybe engage in a car chase or in what ive seen of what theyre doing become a spaceship sort of like a flying island their imaginations run wild and that is what i want its not about tim barrus its not about some stupid typically american controversy its not about the grand poobahs who keep poetry in its cultural place those people would be appalled by boys making poetry its about wherever they want to take it and the wonder is that theyre bothering to take it anywhere maybe their vision has no hope for anyone maybe when theyre done the world they have created in animation will be totally destroyed not unlike europe was not a europe they know but i find something hopeful that the carl sandburg film has sort of become dull as bones in the face of what they want to make on their time as a teacher i want to rock and roll with that their struggle between what is hopeless and what is hope is carl sandburg theyre up all night putting their own subversive film together they want me to read the poetry and i might i might have to set sandburg aside to do that
3420678 wherever theyre going theyre getting there on their own make no mistake about it tim barrus is here for the ride theyre teaching me far more than i could teach them anything all i can do is provide opportunity they dont even need my support theyre going to do it anyway every morning when they pull me to show me what theyve done i have arrived home again
3420679 do indians live in the town you live in or do they mainly live on a reservation
3420680 of the blackfeet 8 000 live on the rez and 8 000 live off valier is off the rez but only barely my neighbor to the east is indian eagle speakers live a block to the north there are other indians in town the town is very wary of them but if they keep their yards nicely and pay their bills everyone forgets theyre indian
3420681 are indians in america required to live on a reservation
3420682 in the us you would be hard pressed to tell the difference between any small town and the reservation tim was on a much larger rez where things were poorer around here sometimes the rez has better stores and amenities like a laundromat than the white towns which are shrinking and falling apart the image of indians and reservations is a constructed one in large part coming from 19th century art
3420683 in europe it is illegal to sell tribal art as a tribal artist if you are not really from the tribe you say you are from people who do that can go to prison are there rules like that in america
3420684 yes there are and there are many games played with this
3420685 there are alternatives to this life you lead you know
3420686 id read mary scrivers prairie mary blog before mainly because i wanted to steal the name its a great name prairie mary it conjures up a vision of laura ingalls wilders great mad aunt emerging from a sod house early in the morning with her apron and her hands bloody from just having butchered a buffalo it is so american shes the only american writer i didnt scare i had gone out of my way to scare everyone at a perfectly ridiculous art blog called flyover if the name is a problem chances are good that so is the content the name implies that you might want to fly over but the content advertises art in this part of america more breathlessly than the junior chamber of commerce prairie mary was there she was sort of standing back in the shadows listening but i saw her eyes sort of roll upward a couple of times at some of the inane stuff at flyover so i thought this woman sounds smart and interesting and shes better than this blog so i wrote to her i found out that one of the things we shared was a history of teaching teachers are so not valued in western culture they make no money yet we need them badly again i had this vision of laura ingalls wilders great aunt in a one room school with a franklin stove and a woodpile in the back which is about as silly as tim barrus having orgies with boys once you get beyond the mythology the name conjures up you find a rich life far more interesting than the mythology and you know thats exactly the sort of person i want my students to be able to communicate with someone who is more real and bigger than the myth they arrive with you guys at cinematheque find everything american intriguing youve seen a little of it but you dont know america yet prairie marys take on art has a lot to do with work and sweat if you read the scriver book personally what i think it does is something no book is ever allowed to do and i dont know that mary would agree with this but i did put it into the video we made and that was about a stripping away of myth to reveal a reality that contained a love story richer than any myth could make thats very difficult to do in publishing because its not marketing and it would scare most publishers into running anyone who can do that has my vote for president

3420689 im always thinking i like growing business thats exciting i like developing energy but how does it affect the last and the least what can we do to make it better for those people who probably never will get to the front of the line how can we make their lives better how can we pull them along how can we make them the most they can be how can we make them build their self esteem and self respect what more can we do

3420702 kita akan menasionalisasi banco de venezuela saya mengajak grupo santander untuk datang kesini supaya kita bisa mulai bernegosiasi
3420703 tetapi ini adalah kebijakan dari atas dari elit bukan dari rakyat revolusi haruslah dibangun dari bawah
3420704 ini adalah langkah yang tepat tetapi nasionalisasi setengah setengah tidak akan cukup untuk menyelesaikan kontradiksi ekonomi di dalam revolusi bolivarian kita perlu menasionalisasi seluruh perbankan dan sektor finansial ini adalah kondisi yang diperlukan untuk membentuk ekonomi sosialis yang terencana serta kita juga harus menasionalisasi tanah dan perusahaan perusahaan besar semua di bawah kontrol buruh
3420705 beberapa bulan yang lalu saya menerima informasi bahwa banco de venezuela yang sudah diprivatisasi bertahun tahun lamanya akan dijual oleh pemiliknya di spanyol bahwa sebuah perjanjian telah ditandatangani oleh grupo santander dan sebuah perusahaan bank swasta di venezuela
3420706 dari sini kampanye media dari spanyol dan internasional akan mulai mereka akan mengatakan bahwa chavez adalahs seorang otokrat bahwa chavez adalah seorang diktatur saya tidak peduli kita tetap akan menasionalisasi bank ini
3420707 ada yang aneh disini karena sebelumnya pemilik bank tersebut benar benar ingin menjualnya dan sekarang mereka katakan bahwa mereka tidak ingin menjualnya kepada pemerintahan venezuela kita akan menasionalisi bank venezuela supaya bank tersebut digunakan untuk melayani kepentingan rakyat venezuela laba bank tidak akan diambil oleh grup grup swasta tetapi laba ini akan diinvestasikan di dalam proyek sosialis
3420708 saya tidak setuju kalau perbankan harus berada di bahwa sektor publik sektor swasta lebih efektif dalam menjalankan perbankan
3420709 lihat industri nasional kita di bawah chavez semua rusak ini membuktikan bahwa nasionalisasi adalah langkah yang salah ini membuktikan kegagalan sosialisme
3420710 esa consultations in the 21st century address increasingly complex issues we need a regulatory framework to guide those consultations that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as climate change
3420711 the existing regulations create unnecessary conflicts and delays the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3420712 the purpose of these changes is to reduce ambiguity improve consistency and narrow interpretive differences even within the services they are a positive step forward
3420713 in 1986 our existing rules made sense at that time very few federal action agencies had any in depth expertise with section 7 and listed species but that is not the case today we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat

3420724 temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly
3420725 we heard loud and clear today how much people care about their gmail accounts
3420726 we followed all the e mails to our support team and user group we fielded phone calls from google apps customers and friends and we saw the many twitter posts we also heard from plenty of googlers who use gmail for company e mail we never take for granted the commitment weve made to running an e mail service that you can count on
3420727 conducting a full review of what went wrong and moving quickly to update our internal systems and procedures accordingly
3420728 but we wanted to make an exception in this case since so many people were impacted
3420729 their quick response shows their commitment to keep gmail up and running as smoothly as possible which should give users some assurance that google is highly committed to delivering a powerful e mail system that can be used by business users and consumers alike
3420730 this glitch has to be kept in the minds of enterprise users that are looking at gmail use within large companies
3420731 google needs to continue to provide the highest level of customer service and quality of service if they have any hopes of attracting large business customers
3420732 these growing pains which are more evident each day that we rely more on service based software efforts indicate that you cant really trust the cloud at this juncture its too early and providers are learning as they go

3420934 usted hace menci n a lo que dice el cantar de los cantares respecto a la relaci n entre una pareja pero creo que le falta ver un poco m s all de lo que dice salom n a su amada y viceversa
3420935 el sexo es un don que nos dio dios para disfrutarlo con nuestra pareja pero en matrimonio el cantar nunca habla de relaciones sexuales fuera del matrimonio aunque no lo dice expl citamente por eso le digo que tiene que leer otros libros de la biblia para entender por qu le digo que es en el contexto del matrimonio pero por favor no se lo pregunte a los sacerdotes cat licos c mo van a entender algo que no practican c mo pueden hablar de matrimonio si no se casan ahora bien usted puede estar o no de acuerdo con que el sexo sea para practicarlo nada m s en el matrimonio pero eso es lo que quiere dios usted puede tomar la decisi n que quiera o cuestion rselo a dios porque l nos da un libre albedr o en su palabra nos dice qu es lo que debemos hacer como en los diez mandamientos que por cierto no es lo nico que nos pide pero tambi n nos da oportunidad de decidir
3420936 dr blancarte lo nico que me gustar a aclarar de su columna es sin duda que ud esta cometiendo el mismo error que achaca a la jerarqu a cat lica torcer las escrituras para dar a conocer un punto aclaro que no soy cat lico mas bien mi confesi n es de tipo protestante evang lico por lo cual creo que la biblia es la palabra de dios y me da gusto que se proclamen sus verdades en publico en especial algo que se ha torcido durante tanto tiempo la val a de la relaci n de pareja y la bondad del creador al regalarnos esto a los seres humanos como una imagen del amor que nos tiene le comento que usted esta usando la escritura de forma incompleta porque menciona en su columna porque proponer la abstinencia es precisamente querer apagar el amor y la pasi n que la propia biblia consigna en el cantar de los cantares es un argumento falso porque la escritura en general y el cantar de los cantares en espec fico hablan del contexto para el cual dios creo el sexo el matrimonio v alo por si mismo se trata de dos esposos de quienes se desprende este hermoso texto acerca del amor de pareja el sexo es bueno dios lo creo pero esta dise ado para que su disfrute en plenitud sea entre dos personas comprometidas en matrimonio sin las consecuencias tristes de las enfermedades y embarazos no deseados el control natal no es condenado por la escritura solo la conciencia de cada persona le redarg ira sic

3420942 you are not able to serve the lord he is a holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your rebellion and your sins 20 if you forsake the lord and serve foreign gods he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you after he has been good to you

3420962 americans have intense feelings about this subject combined with limited knowledge a combination not conducive to the shedding of light on a complex issue it is also the function of a gross oversimplification that reaches near toxic levels where the middle east is concerned such an atmosphere is extremely harmful to american public discourse especially to the process of infusing the debate on u s actions in the middle east with the context and background without which it is impossible to understand what is happening there and why d iscourse in the united states about foreign affairs is so often driven by the the lowest common denominator by ill informed pundits rather than by people who are actually knowledgeable about the rest of the world

3420982 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3420983 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3420984 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3420985 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3420986 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3420987 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3420988 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3420989 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3420990 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3420991 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3420992 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3420993 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3420994 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3420995 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives

3421012 the federal government has got an onslaught of cyberattacks from foreign entities and it needs to do something pretty quickly
3421013 this whole tic initiative has caused civilian agencies who one could argue are not as security savvy as the intelligence community and the defense department to really button things up
3421014 internet access if its not managed properly can provide security risks

3421026 we have built a world class team of cloning practitioners and have key industry relationships in place
3421027 we are now creating a company that holds the proprietary intellectual property and has demonstrated operating leadership in the field customers can secure a license to practice or contract cloning services
3421028 our company has demonstrated expertise in use of nuclear transfer technology to clone animals for better breeding

3421036 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3421037 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3421038 when we arrived and news came that gori was being shelled i saw my footage i said thats not gori thats tskhinvali having crawled through the length and breadth of tskhinvali i dont need much to tell from which point this or that footage was recorded i can swear in front of any tribunal i can point at this location on the map of the town because i and the cameraman of the rossiya channel videotaped that

3421064 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat

3421066 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3421067 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3421068 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3421069 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason

3421074 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3421075 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3421076 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3421077 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3421078 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3421079 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3421080 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3421081 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3421082 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3421083 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3421084 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3421085 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3421086 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

3421092 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3421093 anyone whos paid attention knows that obama makes many more gaffes than mccain
3421094 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

3421096 although valuable information has been gained we thought that there were probably a lot more animals being seen but not being reported to us

3421098 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances
3421099 you have to put the narrative first the reality is no matter how many 3 d screens we get you are still going to have a large number of people possibly the majority of people who see the film in a 2 d environment
3421100 the systems themselves in my opinion can handle any creative challenge weve learned a lot since shooting ghosts of the abyss
3421101 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar is we have our virtual camera which allows me to in real time hold a camera its really a monitor in my hands and point it at the actors and see them as their cg chartacters
3421102 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character
3421103 you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
3421104 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system
3421105 its this amazing ability to quickly conjure scenes and images and great fantasyscapes that is very visual we call it director centric because i can use the camera to block the actors
3421106 when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there as the processing power goes up our models get more sophisticated and our lighting tools get more sophisticated even while we are making this movie im still doing a lot of virtual camera work on the film on stuff that was shot six months ago
3421107 we changed the words and he redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
3421108 one movie where the aesthetics of physical production and the aesthetics of virtual production are to the extent that we could do it pretty much it identical
3421109 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production
3421110 we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
3421111 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time
3421112 are we looking at a situation maybe 10 15 years out where most laptops are sold with 3 d stereoscopic screens most monitors are stereo compatible most dvd players can run stereo content i can see this becoming much more pervasive that we are thinking now
3421113 i think back of our shots at titanic lensed for
3421114 when we look at 3 d display devices in the home which are already becoming available a lot of filmmakers and studios need to be making 3 d right now those production commitments are often based on the here and now instead of thinking about how much value there is to this 3 d product in the future why not master in 3 d now if there is only an incremental expense why not think about that now
3421115 below inflation pay offers are unacceptable especially at this time of price rises pushing up the cost of living
3421116 the isle of man is disproportionately hit by current fuel increases and is currently experiencing inflation well above the rate of britain
3421117 manx telecom is well aware that their offer is effectively a pay cut for their employees

3421141 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3421142 at least one from each major family in the series
3421143 there are six long months of work in this research
3421144 some will be against this and some will be for it
3421145 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3421146 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3421147 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are

3421283 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3421284 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3421285 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3421286 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3421287 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3421288 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3421289 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3421290 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3421291 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3421292 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3421293 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3421294 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3421295 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3421296 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3421297 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3421298 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3421299 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3421300 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3421301 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3421302 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3421303 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3421304 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3421305 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3421306 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3421307 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3421308 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3421309 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3421310 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3421311 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3421312 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3421313 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3421314 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3421315 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3421316 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3421317 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3421318 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3421319 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3421320 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3421321 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3421322 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3421323 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3421324 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3421325 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3421326 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3421327 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3421328 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3421329 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3421330 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3421331 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3421332 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3421333 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3421334 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3421335 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3421336 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3421337 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3421338 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3421339 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3421340 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3421341 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3421342 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3421343 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3421344 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3421345 just so you all know we did set a record
3421346 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3421347 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3421348 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3421349 in fact lesley wasnt even aware that skip had been arrested hayden found out about her dads arrest when he called her from jail they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3421350 ive already ordered a crane to go down there that creek has got a lot of damage there are big culverts that are blocking the water im afraid that if we get another rain were going to have another disaster here so ive ordered the crane to go down there immediately and start removing any debris

3421371 to date the canadian office market has not been impacted to the same degree as many other markets around the world however many of the same factors that affect other markets are going to affect our markets too at the end of the first quarter of the year the national office vacancy rate in canada was 6 4 but this will undoubtedly increase as new space now being constructed comes on stream as new space is added the competition for space will decrease with a concomitant effect on occupancy costs in some markets

3421396 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3421397 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view

3421406 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3421407 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity

3421411 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3421412 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3421413 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now

3421419 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3421420 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3421421 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3421422 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3421423 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3421424 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency

3421435 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here
3421436 john mccain has a record of independence to be very appealing to the south east part of the state which candidly has been derelict recently

3421442 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3421443 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3421444 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3421445 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3421446 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3421447 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3421448 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3421449 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3421450 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3421451 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3421452 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3421453 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law

3421459 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3421460 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3421461 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3421462 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3421463 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3421464 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3421465 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3421466 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3421467 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3421468 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3421469 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3421470 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3421471 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3421472 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3421473 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3421474 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3421475 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3421476 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3421477 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3421478 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3421479 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3421480 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3421481 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3421482 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3421483 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3421484 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3421485 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3421486 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3421487 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3421488 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3421489 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3421490 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3421491 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3421492 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3421493 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3421494 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3421495 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3421496 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3421497 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3421498 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3421499 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3421500 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3421501 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3421502 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3421503 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3421504 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3421505 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3421506 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet

3421508 people have to drive to a place that may take them through neighborhoods they otherwise may never go
3421509 their safety might be compromised whether that is real or perceived its real to them
3421510 second families have left the city and they want to bring their family members closer to them
3421511 people have grown older and they simply dont or cant drive to the city anymore they want to be near to those they love
3421512 he couldnt go he didnt want to leave detroit but i guess he finally had to
3421513 have you been to detroit i pray the car doesnt break down i cringe when i drive down gratiot im worried for my life theres a lot of bad people in detroit but to tell you the truth theres a lot of bad people out here but at least were closer this way
3421514 ive got friends up there its one stop visiting this way me i dont forget my people no sir
3421515 what it says to me is that there is a deeply ingrained fear on the part of suburbanites in terms of their attitude toward the city and its hold is very powerful and very deep
3421516 when theyre afraid to cross eight mile to visit a cemetery it tells you what were up against and any solutions are not going to be easy
3421517 weve even had people mail us cremated remains from florida
3421518 no one is blameless in the dangerous game that has erupted into deadly war in the caucasus georgias president mikheil saakashvili foolishly and tragically baited the russians or even more foolishly fell into moscows trap when he sent his army into the separatist enclave of south ossetia last week the bush administration has alternately egged on mr saakashvili although apparently not this time and looked the other way as the kremlin has bullied and blackmailed its neighbors and its own people there is no imaginable excuse for russias invasion of georgia after pounding both civilian and military targets with strategic bombers and missiles russian armored vehicles rolled into georgia on monday raising fears of an all out assault on the capital and mr saakashvilis democratically elected government moscow claims it is merely defending the rights of ethnic minorities in south ossetia and abkhazia which have been trying to break from georgia since the early 1990s but its ambitions go far beyond that prime minister vladimir putin who has shouldered aside russias new president dmitri medvedev to run the war appears determined to reimpose by force and intimidation as much of the old soviet sphere of influence as he can get away with mr saakashvili with his pro western ambitions and desire to join nato has particularly drawn mr putins ire but the assault on georgia is also clearly intended to bully ukraine into dropping its nato bid and frighten any other neighbor or former satellite that might balk at following moscows line the united states and its european allies must tell mr putin in the clearest possible terms that such aggression will not be tolerated and that there will be no redivision of europe given russias oil wealth and nuclear arsenal the wests leverage is limited but not inconsequential russia still wants respect economic deals and a seat at the table including membership in the world trade organization and a new political and economic cooperation deal with the european union moscow is also eager to complete a civilian nuclear cooperation deal with the united states that could be worth billions there can be no business as usual until russian troops are out of georgia fighting has ended and all sides have agreed on a plan for calming the tensions in south ossetia and abkhazia at a minimum that means international mediation more autonomy for both regions and the stationing of truly neutral international peacekeepers not russian troops mr saakashvili will have to abandon his ambitions to reassert control over the two regions because of his miscalculation his army has been routed and his country badly damaged the united states and europe also need to take a hard look at their relationship with russia going forward neither has protested loudly or persuasively enough as mr putin has used russias oil and gas wealth to blackmail its neighbors throttled russias free press and harassed and imprisoned opponents the bush administration has made mr putins job even easier feeding nationalist resentments with its relentless drive for missile defense the europeans who are far too dependent on russian gas supplies have deluded themselves into believing that they alone will be safe from moscows bullying the west wants and needs russia as a full responsible partner for that russia needs to behave responsibly and the united states and europe must make clear that anything less is unacceptable

3421526 not even puritan clergymen were immune to the lure of sensationalism before the end of the seventeenth century new england ministers and printers started tinkering with the religious literature of crime evidently trying to strengthen its message and broaden its appeal
3421527 for a variety of reasons rather than publishing tracts themselves most clergymen looked to boston ministers to print edifying treatises altogether at least 351 out of 531 new england ministers did not publish at all preferring to rely on the writings of their colleagues

3421535 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year

3421552 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3421553 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3421554 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3421555 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3421556 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3421557 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3421558 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

3421562 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3421563 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3421564 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable

3421753 after careful consideration of complex housing act provisions the judge ruled that information being given late did not mean that the penalty was payable because the information had been provided before the tenant submitted his application
3421754 whether the cut off point for compliance is before a tenant lodges an application with the court or before the date of the hearing itself was not clarified but our interpretation in line with government intention favours the date of the actual hearing
3421755 there is also a penalty for failing to register the deposit under one of the schemes and the same principle should apply but the rla advises that if the landlord takes a deposit it would be good practice to register and protect it and give the tenant the prescribed information within 14 days of receipt to avoid the possible future worry and cost of a court application
3421756 likewise a tenant should be given a copy of the official receipt from the scheme when the deposit is registered
3421757 this is the first case that has gone on appeal the rla has concerns about the complexity of the requirements and our advice therefore is not to take a tenancy deposit at all but instead to take two months rent in advance at the start of the tenancy

3421773 when a family receives a notice of default folks need someone they can trust to get them through the transition of selling a home under distress my job is to match them up with buyers looking for a great home at a reasonable price
3421774 it seems that in this market cash is king however deals are still getting done and loans are still being approved we just have to be realistic about our expectations in this market and be innovative in listing and buying homes for our clients

3421787 no tenemos ninguna sensaci n en especial yo me di cuenta de que era el griego cuando entr a la cancha y le vi la cara lo que pas fue hace mucho y ya son cosas pasadas
3421788 lo tomamos como algo normal estas son cosas que pasan no tuvimos ninguna precauci n ni charlamos nada antes del partido
3421789 ambos partidos son instrumentos o herramientas del terrorismo de eta batasuna
3421790 falta de participaci n de las bases en la toma de decisiones
3421791 el partido no es propiedad de un reducido grupo de personas
3421792 de nada sirve que nos presentemos ante nuestros votantes como un partido innovador que apuesta por una nueva forma de entender la pol tica y la democracia si upd no cumple con una serie de requisitos recogidos en la ley de partidos pol ticos en la constituci n espa ola y en sus propios estatutos
3421793 a las sucesivas reuniones del consejo pol tico desde la fundaci n del partido se ha ido desconvocando a consejeros sin motivo alguno ese hecho tambi n ha ocurrido con algunos miembros de las coordinadoras y se ha repetido en algunos comit s locales los miembros del consejo pol tico rara vez han efectuado votaciones y en cuanto ha habido alguien con posiciones cr ticas inmediatamente ha sido censurado
3421794 zp pide respetar la ley pero hay leyes que permiten la impunidad
3421795 zp pide respetar la ley pero hay leyes que permiten la impunidad
3421796 no se puede esperar nada coherente de los partidos nacionalistas
3421797 no son nada sin la complicidad de quienes tienen la responsabilidad de gobierno por eso del gobierno nacional y de los auton micos de quienes s tenemos derecho a esperar una defensa sin matices del estado social y democr tico de derecho
3421798 quien esta levantando los bajos instintos sino una muy concreta clase pol tica empe ada en permitir que se usen las balanzas fiscales como ariete entre unos territorios y otros
3421799 inacci n del partido socialista incapaz de articular un discurso nacional coherente y comprometido con la salvaguarda de la igualdad de todos los espa oles con independencia de la comunidad aut noma en la que vivan hoy por hoy en las filas del psoe esto es una ficci n

3421802 i am willing to shell out any amount for kim ive been trying to get her to do it for years
3421803 kim previously declined the offer for the cover citing her religious beliefs and devotion to god but a source close to kim says but she is considering hefners offer this time around cant wait to see how this pans out lol
3421804 since their formation the zimbabwe defence forces have remained steadfast in defending our national sovereignty territorial integrity and interests as well as our hard won independence
3421805 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilise our peace and stability and thus cause confusion in our country
3421806 its unknowable when a deal will be reached but the president is due back from zimbabwe later today
3421807 a zanu pf official said tsvangirai wanted a transfer of power to him and not a deal to share power
3421808 if you are on the enemys side or you are being used by enemies stop it
3421809 i can assure you that whether its enduring an unwelcome house guest your co workers or your tax man one of the wretched ailments mysteries is that you are in fact coming off 10 times better than you feel or think you look

3421811 at least i trust them enough to know they were honest with me
3421812 if he wanted to apologise he would have apologised the following day
3421813 this was only because the police said if he didnt sign the caution he would go to court
3421814 he called me a f ing fat dyke in front of people i felt humiliated
3421815 im 60 years old i have four children and eight grandchildren
3421816 its out of order for a man in that position to come out with something like that
3421817 they have come back and said he wasnt there as a councillor he was there as a normal person
3421818 but normal people arent allowed at a count and he was wearing a badge saying councillor liam smith so its a whitewash
3421819 following advice from the crown prosecution service cps a conditional caution was given
3421820 mr smith was given a conditional caution for an offence of section 5 of the public order act for the remark he made to mrs connelly
3421821 this requires an offender to agree to a number of undertakings
3421822 the cps takes homophobic crime very seriously but in this particular case after careful consideration we decided the word dyke was not being used in a homophobic way against mrs connelly
3421823 when were you first aware of the fleeting nature of time and life was there anything special that happened at that time
3421824 how would you describe your life now what is your attitude towards life
3421825 the most important take away for us i think is that you cant do it all and you really shouldn t anyway pick which tools will help and devote some effort to them and let the others fall remember that no matter what you do you wont ever reach every potential target and or get every opportunity that might be a potential project for you there is just no way to cover all the bases even with a team of geeks working every system out there choose what you will do put in good effort there and stop regretting what you choose not to do
3421826 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3421827 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump
3421828 i hope to resonate with each viewer as they reflect on the work and their own experiences with similar medical settings
3421829 the art market is not sexist the likes of bridget riley and louise bourgeois are of the second and third rank there has never been a first rank woman artist only men are capable of aesthetic greatness
3421830 women are no good at squeezing cars through spaces if you have someone who is unable to relate space to volume they wont make a good artist look at barbara hepworth a one trick pony look at that pile of rubbish in the tate by rachel whiteread
3421831 pilar ordovas the head of contemporary art at christies also rejected claims the market is sexist
3421832 prior to the 1980s auditions for top orchestras were open that is the auditioning committee sat and watched one musician after another come in and play in front of the judges

3421834 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this was especially disappointing considering it forced me to miss the british open and it comes in a ryder cup year
3421835 i was pulled back to the group and re surfaced a bit later to see s who had not joined the coloring sitting alone
3421836 environments backgrounds and even facial features appear more true to life while deep background images gain heightened clarity so gamers can identify and target enemies at greater distances and with greater accuracy
3421837 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
3421838 this is a shaft of very bright light that cuts through any economic gloom
3421839 advertisers should be taking advantage of a medium that offers proven effectiveness increasing value and is growing
3421840 the addition of brian strosser as a vice president and the launch of this new division is just the first of many new initiatives we have planned

3421844 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co game set and match
3421845 but im wondering if its better to keep it narrowed down and leave the viewer wanting more or to create two galleries because theres so much of a story to tell and to allow the viewer to better become part of this world
3421846 is also still as great as ever with a factor of 2 at both high and low latitudes
3421847 because we have not had recent climate changes of the magnitude forecast for the rest of this century
3421848 we can have greater confidence in the multi model mean changes than in that of any individual model for climate change assessments
3421849 it is doubtful that averaging different formulations together will end up giving the right result
3421850 model responses e g tropical land precipitation can often be of different signs and there can be little confidence that averaging them together will produce a better result
3421851 at this point we cannot determine the low and high latitude sensitivities and we have no real way of obtaining them our italics
3421852 affect the confidence we can have in many of our projections of atmospheric dynamic and hydrologic responses to global warming
3421853 forecasting even the large scale response to climate change is not easy given the current uncertainties
3421854 regional responses may be the end result of varying influences in part due to warming in different tropical and high latitude regions
3421855 we like to say that there are 11 million pairs of eyes to ensure good government in ohio

3421859 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
3421860 lin miaoke might be only 9 years old but she is well on her way to becoming a star thanks to her heartwarming performance
3421861 if youre not good looking no matter how well you sing youll not be onstage do you know youre twisting a whole generation

3421867 then the lord was jealous for his land and had pity on his people and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen nations
3421868 they answered him lord we want our eyes to be opened and jesus in pity touched their eyes and instantly they received their sight and followed him
3421869 but instead warn admonish urge and encourage one another every day as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened into settled rebellion by the deceitfulness of sin by the fradulence the strategem the trickery which the delusive glamor of his sin may play on him

3421873 the chance of finding a lamin a c mutation in an individual with this range of cardiac problems family history is decent over 50 but definitely not nearing 100 that of course means that a negative test will not prove that you dont have this type of heart problem
3421874 our goal with the real time server application is two fold not only do we want to address the challenges often associated with manual quoting processes and field sales support but we also want to further enhance the benefits associated with an automated quoting process as offered through quotewerks
3421875 aside from the ability to obtain real time price and availability information the real time application will allow sales reps to obtain product data sheets and provides links to manufacturing websites relating to the products included in the quote by giving the sales representative as much information upfront and in a real time environment a company stands a greater chance of winning the sale and more importantly the customer
3421876 when she wasnt out at nightclubs she was taking acting classes we dated for only a few months but in that period i spent a lot of time with her and her friends whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience

3421885 given strongcos lower than expected operating results challenging market conditions and the need to position the fund for the future the trustees decided to suspend distributions
3421886 we are fully aware of the importance of distributions to our unitholders however the fund needs to conserve cash to maintain balance sheet strength and meet operating requirements we believe suspending distributions is a fiscally responsible measure to maintain strongco for the long term

3421920 i am one of those people who believes that your gut instinct comes from somewhere
3421921 you get that feeling in the pit of your stomach its for a reason and we would probably all benefit if we trusted our guts a little more i know that there are moments where i wish i had trusted my gut in the past where i didnt and there are moments where ive had a feeling about something and gone for it and its worked out wonderfully

3421940 a lot of the things in the movie are kind of based on people that i knew here like people i worked with family and friends

3421987 en cristo jes s que existiendo ya en forma de dios no consider una usurpaci n ser igual a dios sino que se vaci a s mismo tomando la forma de siervo deviniendo en semejanza a los hombres
3421988 padre pues le has dado potestad sobre toda carne para que d vida eterna a todos los que le diste
3421989 sobre la filiaci n de cristo al igual que fue declarado hijo de dios con todo poder por su resurrecci n es dado al hombre un nuevo esp ritu de adopci n establecer y otro paralelismo para el car cter de fuerza poder tanto del reino de dios como del hijo cuya expresi n con el mismo sintagma servet enfatiza
3421990 pues no recibisteis el esp ritu de esclavitud para el temor de nuevo sino que recibisteis el esp ritu de adopci n en el que clamamos abba padre
3421991 en verdad os digo que hay algunos de los aqu presentes que no probar n la muerte hasta que vean llegar
3421992 definido hijo de dios con poder seg n el esp ritu de santidad a partir de la resurrecci n de entre los muertos

3421995 dios es incomprensible inimaginable e incomunicable pero se revela a nosotros por la idea por la persona en el sentido de forma especie o apariencia externa dios es la mente omniforme y de la sustancia del esp ritu divino emanaron los ngeles y las almas es el pi lago infinito de la sustancia que lo esencia todo y que da el ser a todo y sostiene las esencias de todas las cosas la esencia de dios universal y omniforme esencia a los hombres y a todas las dem s cosas dios contiene en s las esencias de infinitos millares de naturalezas metaf sicamente indivisas

3422001 we didnt come out on the right foot in the first half
3422002 we didnt match their intensity we didnt push forward and make things happen we allowed them to come at us and theyre very skilled and very quick and they made us pay
3422003 kates quite pivotal to the build up of our attack
3422004 for her to get the opportunities she did today hitting the post on one and scoring the other we like to think we have a balance in our forward line
3422005 thats why we didnt perform very well in the second half
3422006 we should have won the match we are not happy with the results
3422007 weve come up against the number two team in the world and the number five team in the world
3422008 even though we see ourselves as being in this company its a very tall order to win these games its what the tie represents we are happy we didnt lose the game but we are disappointed we didnt come away with the win in todays game we have such a high respect for the japanese team we know there are certain areas where we have to play well in the second half we started to do that so were disappointed to come away with the tie after pressing so hard late in the half
3422009 its something weve identified as a group that needs to be addressed
3422010 it needs to change the fact we can turn it up shows how effective we can be its frustrating as a group to know its there and not be able to do it for the full 70 minutes its something we need to focus on as a group from the beginning instead waiting until were a goal down
3422011 o thou lady because thou wouldst come to a foreign land o ninmah because for my sake thou wouldst enter an inimical land because thou hast no fear of the terror of the battle surrounding me therefore of the hill which i the hero have heaped up let its name be hursag mountain and thou be its queen

3422013 against the standing place of the gods it has directed its terror in the sitting place of the anunnaki it has led forth fearfulness its dreadful fear it has hurled upon the land the mountain its dreadful rays of fire it has directed against all the lands

3422045 pues que la patria lo quiere l nzate al combate y muere tu madre te vengar
3422046 crasa herej a m a piensas que es sta de creer que jes s hombre es verdadero y natural prefigurado en la palabra y en el esp ritu pues
3422047 te molesta tambi n que haya llamado et rea a la forma humana del cristo seg n la cual estaba l en la forma de dios pero pr stame un poco de atenci n como ahora es verdaderamente real lo que antes era figurado as es ahora verdaderamente natural al hombre cristo aquella forma que antes por disposici n de dios estaba figurada en la palabra
3422048 ni en la creaci n ni en la encarnaci n se realiz cambio alguno de dios sino una manifestaci n de su sustancia en la creaci n se hizo visible dios abri su tesoro las puertas de la eternidad pero no por eso hay que decir que ha cambiado de alg n modo y en la encarnaci n no se mud la palabra sino que la carne asumida se transform en palabra la idea del cristo antes imperceptible se hizo perceptible visible y tangible como cuerpo de la palabra una forma del hombre fulgor divino quien como hombre hab a de ser visto y como hombre se mostraba tambi n el esp ritu divino existente arquet picamente se hizo perceptible tras la creaci n y lo llen todo pero todo esto no arguye acci n real alguna de dios hacia s mismo ni inspiraci n alguna sino hacia las criaturas ah tienes la verdadera igualdad entre hijo y esp ritu santo el mismo tipo de manifestaci n correspond a tambi n en la creaci n de la palabra y al esp ritu sin alteraci n de s mismo se alaba la palabra para ser vista externamente comunicaba el esp ritu interiormente ahora en el cuerpo del cristo est toda y totalmente la plenitud del padre y del esp ritu entiendes toda esta gloria de cristo qu el hijo contenga plenamente la palabra y el esp ritu hipost ticamente entiendes adem s c mo fue en otro tiempo hijo en potencia formal quien ahora es en acto
3422049 dios est en todas partes lleno de la esencia de todas las cosas
3422050 dios ni cambia de lugar ni se muda por manifestar nuevas formas se trata de nuevos modos de dispensaci n o manifestaci n divina
3422051 es de dominio vulgar que en dios no hay accidentes y que nada le acaece por m s que ciertos sofistas pongan en su trinidad ciertas relaciones entidades imaginarias que a nada responden en la realidad
3422052 todo lo que acaece en la naturaleza siempre le acaece a dios en dios recae no se disipa sino que l lo asume mas no se altera dios por eso son las cosas que acaecen las que se alteran
3422053 ning n absurdo contiene todo esto que pon is varias mutaciones en dios mismo os lo demostraban con toda eficacia arrio y macedonio contra todos vosotros sofistas
3422054 arrio y macedonio dijeron que dios no engendr hijo en s sino fuera de s e hicieron del esp ritu santo una mera criatura
3422055 otro es el camino de la verdad no conocido de los metaf sicos sino de los idiotas y los pescadores que ense a que el hijo de dios verdaderamente engendrado es el hombre cuya generaci n se consum en mar a todas las acciones reales de dios son hacia las criaturas por esta raz n dios hizo desde la eternidad en s mismo y engendr lo que reflexionando constituy en s decret una palabra pr ncipe y un esp ritu pr ncipe sin esas acciones reales vuestras y al decretarlos as engendr por ellos a este hombre la nica generaci n era en dios el decreto de la generaci n que tend a a la generaci n y la nica creaci n el que a la creaci n
3422056 en consecuencia sabidur a era el predesignio y referencia del cristo que conten a todas las cosas en dios y se hab a de comunicar a todas las gentes
3422057 ahora es el cristo mismo y es tambi n la definici n de las cosas en el cristo
3422058 los fil sofos inventaron una tercera entidad desvinculada de los otros dos y realmente distinta que llaman tercera persona o esp ritu santo y de este modo maquinaron una trinidad imaginaria tres entidades en una sola naturaleza como yo no quiero hacer un mal uso del t rmino
3422059 y si esto es as nosotros somos trite stas y para nosotros dios es tripartito nos hemos convertido en ateos esto es sin dios
3422060 hay que decir que la doctrina relativa a la trinidad no podr jam s presumir del derecho de ser una comprensi n adquirida sobre dios ser m s bien una afirmaci n l mite un gesto indicador que se ala a lo inefable pero nunca una definici n encasillada en los ficheros del conocimiento humano ni siquiera de un concepto que sit a a la cosa en el radio de captaci n del esp ritu humano
3422061 busquemos con el nimo del que est a punto de encontrar y encontremos con el nimo del que est buscando todav a cuando se comprende esto al final la ltima palabra de nuestras palabras se hace silencio y la primera palabra de nuestro silencio se hace adoraci n
3422062 yo no separo a cristo y a dios m s que una voz del hablante o un rayo de sol cristo es el padre como la voz en el hablante el y el padre son una misma cosa como el rayo y el sol son la misma luz un tremendo misterio hay por lo tanto en que dios pueda unirse con el hombre y el hombre con dios una sorprendente maravilla en que dios haya tomado para s el cuerpo de cristo con el fin de hacer de l su morada especial 59b y porque su esp ritu era totalmente dios es llamado hombre lo mismo que por su carne es llamado hombre no os maravill is de que lo que vosotros llam is humanidad yo lo adore como dios pues habl is de la humanidad como si estuviera vac a de esp ritu y pens is en la carne seg n la carne no sois capaces de reconocer la calidad del esp ritu de cristo que confiere el ser a la materia el es el que da vida cuando la carne nada aprovecha
3422063 todo es uno porque en dios que es inmutable se reduce a unidad lo mudable se hacen las formas accidentales una sola forma con la forma primera que es la luz madre de las formas el esp ritu y la luz se identifican con dios las cosas con sus ideas y las ideas con la hip stasis primera por donde todo viene a ser modos y subordinaciones de la divinidad
3422064 era el relumbrar al hijo futuro y tend a sustancialmente a la generaci n del hijo
3422065 se trata de la tric fala ilusi n del drag n que a instancias del reino del anticristo se introdujo furtivamente entre los sofistas de verdad esos tres son los esp ritus diab licos de los que est n pose dos quienes reconocen a la trinidad de la bestia

3422071 no os dais cuenta de que se creen autorizados a mataros a vosotros y a vuestros hijos porque beb is vino o cerveza porque no llev is barba larga o chador porque vais al teatro y al cine porque escuch is m sica y cant is canciones porque bail is en las discotecas o en vuestras casas porque veis la televisi n porque vest s minifalda o pantalones cortos porque est is desnudos o casi en el mar o en las piscinas y porque hac is el amor cuando os parece donde os parece y con quien os parece no os importa nada de esto est pidos yo soy atea gracias a dios pero no tengo intenci n alguna de dejarme matar por serlo

3422076 yo estoy muy a gusto con mis sentimientos es mas los necesito para cualquier actividad cotidiana sin ellos estar a realmente ciego
3422077 la gran mayor a de problemas que padece este pa s o lo que queda de el se deben precisamente a que algunos mequetrefes cuestionan la existencia de espa a como tal

3422410 la moschea milanese di viale jenner ha chiesto aiuto ai paesi arabi affinch intervengano per fermare la politica persecutoria di maroni
3422411 in precedenza la direzione dellistituto culturale islamico a milano si legge nellarticolo aveva chiesto ai paesi arabi e islamici di intervenire per fermare la politica persecutoria del ministro degli interni italiano roberto maroni dopo la sua decisione di vietare la preghiera del venerd presso la sede dellistituto culturale islamico
3422412 diversi luoghi di culto per i musulmani nelle citt di gallarate como treviso e in molte altre citt e nonostante tutto ci non c stata alcuna reazione da parte delle ambasciate dei paesi arabi e islamici e neppure da parte dei governi arabi per fermare questa politica discriminatoria
3422413 a milano i musulmani possono pregare il venerd in cinque luoghi diversi non so quale altra grande citt europea dia a disposizione cos tanti centri di preghiera per i musulmani

3422416 c limpegno russo a rispettare e garantire la sovranit della georgia un punto importante
3422417 un paese indipendente un paese sovrano e questa formula il principio della sovranit a mio parere pi importante del principio dellintegrit territoriale
3422418 senza dubbio riconosce la sovranit della georgia ma questo non significa che la parte georgiana possa fare tutto quello che vuole

3422447 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3422448 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3422449 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3422450 i have fulfilled a dream it will be unique i have arrived to help spurs
3422451 i am also here to fight for my place it is up to the manager gomes is a good keeper i believe that the both of us offer a good level
3422452 tottenham want a big season and i am ready for the challenge i know the spurs squad is capable of a great performance in the premier league i am prepared for everything
3422453 i was delighted with josh at sparta prague in fact he has worked very hard all the way through the summer
3422454 but i have told him that he has to work even harder if he wants to play regularly at the highest level and that is his challenge
3422455 even after the challenging early growing season with the flooding not only do they the usda project more acres to be harvested than they expected back in july but they expect yields to be significantly higher than were previously estimated
3422456 nearly ideal growing season weather across much of the corn belt since late june has supported crop development and increased yield prospects
3422457 i have no strength at all dropping stuff out of my hand cant do anything
3422458 by preserving motion at adjacent segments you can prevent degeneration
3422459 i had neck pain all the way down my shoulders to my finger seven months later
3422460 fully recovered energy is back i feel great i feel a lot different than ive felt for a long time
3422461 i just want the pain to go away and start enjoying life
3422462 ive already won the battle as far as overcoming this disease and basically meeting my goals while knowing that i have cancer
3422463 i was really upset and i got angry when i was diagnosed
3422464 and i had a choice it could either hurt me or help me and i made sure it helped me
3422465 i went up to him and i said you know what
3422466 one of the things ive learned with my mom having it twice my grandmother having it my dad having it the last thing the person wants is for you to treat them like they cant do things for them themselves
3422467 its one of those things where you wake up and you have choices to make every day and i can chose to let it control my life or i can chose to not and im choosing to live the way i want to and do the things that i want to do
3422468 cancer of the testicle is a very curable cancer with cure rate well over 90 percent when its caught in the early stage
3422469 because a tumor in the testicle isnt going to spread quickly to the other organs this is one of those times in your life when you weigh the timing of your surgery with the timing of the major events in your life and its ok to put off the surgery for a little while in favor of a major event like the olympics
3422470 if was his mother i would tell him to swim
3422471 i dont think you can put it in any better terms than that
3422472 im not going to let this disease live my life for me
3422473 winning the medal would be like icing on the cake for my swimming career
3422474 im up there representing basically the cancer community and hopefully showing people that there is a fight to do this you dont have to be afraid of it you dont have to let this disease control your life

3422484 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire
3422485 it makes our smart creative audience full partners in salons publishing future
3422486 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3422487 since 1884 weve had a roll call vote its a nominating convention not a coronation
3422488 party operatives are still trying to find the appropriate role for the former president and first lady in the crowning of barack obama as the partys presidential nominee
3422489 wow it was even worse than id imagined the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
3422490 clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to
3422491 appearing on cnn obama said that when he was running for the senate there was an image of me superimposed over a picture of al qaeda leader osama bin laden
3422492 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3422493 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3422494 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement says a description of the plan on the obama campaigns web site
3422495 a lot of non black people will say that the election of barack obama is now proof we dont need affirmative action
3422496 m ost people would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia
3422497 its dead right now im not bringing out another issue ill just close it up
3422498 tend to pick up stories from the national enquirer with tongs
3422499 been very right about some things o j they got right jesse jacksons child they got right but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories and its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this

3422513 thats what im talking about thats the score of the century i can go home now
3422514 theres so many people going out of business you can get stuff at one third the price
3422515 they dont realize how much it costs in a store almost everyone who starts out gets burned the first few times
3422516 theres comes to a point where your employees are earning more than you are thats not a good situation to be in
3422517 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3422518 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3422519 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3422520 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3422521 the measure in south dakota would allow politicians to interfere with personal decisions best made by women and their families
3422522 they are being deceptive by characterising this proposed law as more reasonable and less restrictive
3422523 t he truth is that this ban would be the most rigid and inflexible ban on abortion in the united states
3422524 i think there are other strategies and tactics that get us far closer to advancing the cause of human life
3422525 the class of 2008 is one of the most accomplished groups thats ever been inducted into the u s hockey hall of fame
3422526 it is indeed with great pleasure that we welcome them to the group of hockey immortals in our country
3422527 its the only way to make sure these types of events dont repeat and there needs to be severe criminal penalties
3422528 wonder woman is in the very top tier of dc characters that we havent over explored yet in animation
3422529 there was a lot of interest in the direct to dvd department in doing a wonder woman long form theatrical type experience as early as we could so this was our opportunity and we took it
3422530 we cherry picked from lots of different versions of wonder woman its not specifically based on any one version it has a lot of golden age elements its a got a little of the perez revamp and its even got some stuff from the lynda carter version so its an amalgamation of all the different things that we love about wonder woman
3422531 when we first started talking about doing the dc universe animated movies the idea was to adapt directly from source material and give the fans the stories that theyve always wanted to see on the screen we want to keep finding those stories from the comics that we can just adapt directly and we do have some of those in the hopper
3422532 but what we tend to find like with wonder woman for example is that there are great scenes here that are very cinematic she has great moments and a core story
3422533 this was our chance to do all of that its her origin story and her first mission into mans world and it has lots and lots of fighting
3422534 to a degree were always our own worst enemies we set ourselves up with unrealistic expectations of what these movies should be we always say this isnt going to be a wonder woman movie its going to be
3422535 we look at these movies and say if we were going to do a live action wonder woman movie only in 70 minutes what would it be so you want to include as many of the iconic parts of the original source material as possible
3422536 whos the arch villain who are the supporting characters you want to get all that stuff in it so when long time wonder woman fans go to see it they say oh theres steve trevor or hey theres etta candy and hey theres ares so thats the rough blueprint these elements have to be in there then we have to come up with a story for those guys and thats when it gets tough
3422537 i wanted so much to do a project that had a lot of women in it so many of the dc properties are male orientated and i wanted to do something that was a female driven show thats what was lovely about this one that it was different in that way
3422538 its great i cant begin to say how awesome it is ive always preferred working with female characters because they have a much wider range of emotions you can address
3422539 if you have batman crying in a corner people are going to look at it a little odd but with wonder woman she can cry and thats okay and she can kick ass and thats okay too so any female character for me is just better
3422540 basically were showing wonder woman as a strong independent female force if girls can see that and be inspired by that in the same way that any little boy can watch superman and be inspired then thats awesome
3422541 the casting was kind of a no brainer as far as wonder woman and steve trevor go
3422542 the guys who sign my checks tell me i have to bring in celebrities
3422543 we want to make really good movies with really good stories and if anything inspire the theatrical division who are working really hard on their end if theyre having a problem adapting some of these characters like wonder woman or flash we can say heres a way in imagine what you could do with your resources
3422544 personally im much more interested in getting deeper into the back log of really odd ball characters like the question the new gods or jonah hex hopefully this series will continue to sell well and well get there eventually
3422545 its on hold still currently were still evaluating where the market place is and if there is enough interest and demand for it we hope there will be and we hope to get back to it someday
3422546 teen titans is a tricky one the script is in pretty good shape the issue there is that we want to give the fans what they want but every time we do research after a premiere of one of our films and we ask the fans what they want they always say superman and batman teen titans is always last on the list so until the fans we ask put it at the top of the list itll be a harder one to do
3422547 i had expected it later this year when it would be more clear the u s economy was through the worst of the slowdown
3422548 hey wow i can stop quick enough in 40mm of water going straight so i always go straight on the freeway so im always ok
3422549 throughout this summer we have seen the promise of there being better weather but it hasnt ever really materialised
3422550 over the next few days its not looking too great we have had a few decent days this summer and the best we can expect is for a few more days here and there there doesnt seem to be any consistent or confident sense of seeing an extended spell of fine summer weather
3422551 a drivers level of risk is dramatically increased when roads are wet and it is raining heavily it is important that drivers remain alert and take extra precautions in order to make their journey as safe as possible
3422552 it is very easy to misjudge stopping distances in wet weather and this factor is responsible for low speed shunts in traffic jams and on slower speed limit roads

3422607 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3422608 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3422609 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

3422620 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3422621 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3422622 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3422623 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3422624 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3422625 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3422626 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3422637 its disgusting that freebridge is more concerned about making sure no one could ever sue them than ensuring their residents have a good quality of living
3422638 how on earth is someone going to injure themselves whilst playing cards
3422639 freebridge community housing actively promotes the use of its community rooms as the social interaction of its elderly residents and people from the local community is a positive contribution to their lives
3422640 it is general practice that any room hire includes a requirement for insurance
3422641 this can be covered by the group club insurance or could form part of the hire cost freebridge charges a nominal hire charge but then require individuals to organise their own insurance
3422642 the requirement has been in place for many years but as freebridge has recently updated the hire agreement it is checking that groups have their own insurance in place
3422643 there were times when i was doing jack when i actually felt retarded like really retarded

3422648 we cannot tolerate a sanctuary for al qaeda we will ask more of the pakistani government rather than offer a blank cheque to an undemocratic president
3422649 the greatest threat to security in afghanistan and america lies in the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists train and plot attacks and then strike and move back across the border
3422650 we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan pakistan and the nato including necessary assets like satellites and predator drones to secure the border by wiping out terrorist camps and cracking down on cross border insurgents
3422651 hate crime by extremists is met with an agenda of hope
3422652 so this year we selected 50 innovative towns that arent just prime relocation spots right now but smart choices for the future
3422653 not only do they have the action theyve got a plan now were giving you a plan too inside youll find hometown picks that range from adventure 24 7 hubs loaded with outdoor options to urban players that offer a variety of jobs and cultural activities without sacrificing green space
3422654 this is a transition period as china and other emerging countries move towards becoming developed nations and their underlying demand will persist at least in the next 15 to 20 years to keep upward pressure on energy costs
3422655 its unlikely that oil prices will fall back to double digits demand in these countries has not fallen to levels a year ago and as long as they grow there will be fresh demand for resources each year and that accumulative demand will keep supply tight
3422656 it looks unclear if the dollar will keep rising above 110 yen if the dollar reverses its course and falls oil will resume its climb and get back on a rising trend again
3422657 i think 200 is a possibility players see tight supply both in light of current and future fundamentals which will draw money from speculative funds
3422658 its a message from the market that developed countries are not doing enough to tackle the issue of global warming or invest in innovations to save energy and boost efficiency in the use of energy and resources
3422659 since swift action is not taken to change the industrial structure of developed countries that had been supported by cheaply available resources the latest price drop is likely to be a temporary adjustment

3422666 the confrontation with liverpool will not be a matter of details but of extremes they will have to play below their usual level while we will have to play above ours everything will have to go our way
3422667 the way we played against anderlecht is not enough against liverpool
3422668 i saw some defensive na vity which we cannot allow against opponents like them
3422669 we will try to win if that is possible because a good result for us is to win but if that is not possible then the very least we will be looking for is an away goal we have watched videos of standard and had reports on them but it is so early in the season that it is not easy to know how they will play especially as they have a player who has returned from the olympics for this game

3422690 there are six long months of work in this research
3422691 some will be against this and some will be for it
3422692 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3422693 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3422694 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are

3422696 our growth both externally as well as internally was massive the sheer number of new servers and their associated applications proved especially challenging as we attempted to reconcile our business expansion within the physical limits of our current infrastructure we knew virtualization was a means through which we could effectively and intelligently approach our integration challenges

3422702 the diabetes community benefits tremendously from something like this there were a lot of people who were very very excited about it and texting me during the swim this isnt something i could have done five years ago because we just didnt have the technology this is just celebrating what life with diabetes can be like

3422710 why we insulate ourselves from the notion that the external critic can ever be right is because their critique is moot in regards to the progression of our work

3422744 i have many friends and family working for minimum wage and have trouble making ends meet right now when gas is 4 a gallon how are you supposed to pay for it on only 6 an hour
3422745 jfks campaign like barack obamas was also about hope and optimism
3422746 the history ive lived through has allowed me to recognize his fabulous leadership when i saw him
3422747 im going to get involved through campus if necessary and do things there one way or another weve got to get him elected
3422748 im working on a committee to elect a female democrat in our district to congress its the first time ive ever done this
3422749 this time were at a point where people have to stand up and be counted you cant just give lip service the times require this
3422750 im seeing people my age in their 60s who have never been involved in politics never been politically active in their lives say that now is the time and barack obama is the person who can lead us out of the mess that were in
3422751 weve had it with the way things are for our children and for our grandchildren we need to win this election
3422752 i think theres such a hunger for change and you saw that in how smoothly things went
3422753 im just going to take everything in enjoy it and come back with the knowledge
3422754 with so many new democratic voters a record number of volunteers and great candidates running for offices across florida we are seeing a wave of support building to elect barack obama and democrats up and down the ticket
3422755 i worked really hard to get him here in december
3422756 it seemed perfect i was looking for a bench anyway and i found a way to donate to the campaign
3422757 i didnt realize how young harry and emma were until they brought the bench over

3422767 how can we expect any progress in reducing gang violence and youth unemployment or expect to quell the dropout rate if we only have enough program slots to serve 3 of the 14 21 year old eligible population

3422773 need not have a black belt in karate place a premium on machismo swear in class or have working class roots like most students however they must be prepared to validate the identities that their students have taken on as part of growing up
3422774 many black youth develop negative attitudes and behavior patterns regarding education when schools fail to affirm the values and norms of their culture in fact when black youth sense disapproval of their style of academic assertiveness their energy might be channeled into aggressiveness against the academic environment

3422782 the alarming drop out rate this time it is community college
3422783 there is a corresponding compensation that is in the contract that owner operators sign
3422784 so if diesel is between 3 50 and 3 55 a gallon for example it pays x amount
3422785 we have some guys doing seven mpg and their net cost is under a dollar
3422786 what i believe is unique about our program is that as fuel increases the driver gets more of a benefit
3422787 as long as he doesnt erode the miles per gallon the benefits will continue
3422788 we recognize the financial impact of empty miles on our owner operator fleet and we are taking the necessary measures to protect these drivers during these challenging economic times
3422789 keeping our owner operator fleet profitable is essential to the service we provide to our customers all over the country

3422845 the school board should map a path for reversing course quickly perhaps beginning at a closed door tuesday meeting neighbors have legitimately fought the districts plans to cut dozens of trees for a needed ingraham high school expansion a district review recently upheld the tree removal but with city rules apparently blocking any cutting while a master use permit was pending the district sent a letter to neighbors saying it would withdraw its city permit applications for the construction plans cut the trees and soon resubmit the project too clever by half and even more cynical
3422846 we understand eagerness on the districts part to improve facilities hold down costs and stay on schedule if the tree removal is the best plan however the district has nothing to fear from a little patience with all the reviews that may be requested by people who support expansion but question the need for the tree removal and a full examination by the city government which has we might note a record of being as generous as local voters in supporting education
3422847 i will certainly remember its the districts activities when the next levy rolls around and i will be reminding everyone i know as well

3422932 reading should be fun and something children choose to do in their free time otherwise they will struggle when they move on to tackling more technically demanding texts in secondary schools

3422980 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3422981 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3422982 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3422983 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3422984 chromatic has agreed to deal with moderating on my behalf today
3422985 if we play like we played this week well beat australia
3422986 this is a very exciting stage but a starting stage the key is to turn up to every single test match like we turned up to this one with the structures and the players weve got the type of attack weve had in this game the way weve gone about the game and the way weve been up for it every single day and the emotions that the guys have come out with its not far away from a perfect start its the way we want to play our cricket in the future
3422987 what we have got to do is look at the australians and learn from them they are on it every day and every session that is what we have to do and my main drive with this team is to be on top of it every day and make sure we do not have any comfort zones

3422991 we are not at peace yet but we are at a stage of temporary cessation of hostilities which is certainly significant
3422992 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a binding agreement until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3422993 there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3422994 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses
3422995 if this news that military operations are stopping is correct then it is what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace
3422996 this is a beautiful place with a wonderful people they dont deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations
3422997 these discussions between the roman catholic church and the anglican communion have been going on for 42 years
3422998 we would like to bring these down to the local level

3423008 their reasons dont mean anything unless i have a choice peris and they dont give anyone a choice
3423009 they are potentially more costly to the public and it is likely that tolls on a privately operated highway will increase to a greater extent than they would on a publicly operated toll road there is also the risk of tolls being set that exceed the costs of the facility including a reasonable rate of return should a private concessionaire gain market power because of the lack of viable travel alternatives
3423010 using a highway public private partnership to extract value from an existing facility also raises issues about the use of those proceeds and whether future users might potentially pay higher tolls to support current benefits
3423011 in some instances up front payments have been used for immediate needs and it remains to be seen whether these uses provide long term benefits to future generations who will potentially be paying progressively higher toll rates to the private sector throughout the length of a concession agreement
3423012 were not justifiable given the limited value of risk transfer in the project
3423013 despite the need for careful analysis the approach at the federal level has not been fully balanced as dot has done much to promote the benefits but comparatively little to either assist states and localities weigh potential costs and trade offs nor to assess how potentially important national interests might be protected in highway public private partnerships

3423077 we are happy to report that cassinis begun sending data home
3423078 the downlink will continue through the night and into tomorrow morning
3423079 there is a lot of anticipation and excitement about what todays flyby might reveal
3423080 over the next few days and weeks the cassini teams will be analyzing the photos and other data to tease out new clues about this tiny active world
3423081 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3423082 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3423083 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3423084 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3423085 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3423086 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3423087 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3423088 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3423089 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3423090 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3423091 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3423092 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3423093 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3423094 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3423095 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3423096 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3423097 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3423098 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3423099 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3423100 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3423101 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3423102 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3423103 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3423104 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3423105 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3423106 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3423107 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3423108 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3423109 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3423110 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3423111 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3423112 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3423113 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3423114 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3423115 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3423116 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3423117 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3423118 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3423119 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3423120 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3423121 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3423122 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3423123 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3423124 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3423125 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3423126 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3423127 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3423128 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3423129 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3423130 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3423131 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3423132 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3423133 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3423134 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3423135 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3423136 who are open to doing something on the production side
3423137 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3423138 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3423139 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3423140 cloak three dimensional objects using artificially engineered materials that redirect light around the objects
3423141 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3423142 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3423143 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3423144 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3423145 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3423146 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3423147 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3423148 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3423149 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3423150 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3423151 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3423152 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3423153 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3423154 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3423155 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3423156 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3423157 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3423158 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3423159 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3423160 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3423161 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3423162 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3423163 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3423164 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3423167 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3423254 es gibt gr nde daf r die wir verstehen m ssen das problem der italiener ist dass sie ihre informationen sichern m ssen auch gegen verr ter in ihren eigenen reihen abgesehen von der taskforce haben wir seit vergangenem august keine zus tzlichen informationen mehr aus italien bekommen aber wir m ssen das verstehen und akzeptieren

3423293 der grund warum ich jetzt ohne medaille dastehe ist dass ich es verbockt habe und nicht der kampf gegen die kubanerin

3423370 but my scottish presbyterian sleuth was appalled and insisted he needed to lose a few pounds first and so we came up with christmas is murder to launch the series i spent the latter part of my childhood in east sussex where this mystery is set so it was an exercise in nostalgia and loads of fun to write
3423371 christmas is murder is a most enjoyable first mystery in what promises to be a fantastic series

3423378 even there we expect to be in a reasonably good position

3423392 nii kpobi tetteh trsu and his five member committee are carrying out these wicked acts with the assistance of numerous land guards
3423393 as a law abiding citizen and a christian i would use the right procedures to seek justice

3423395 this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeits of our own behaviour we make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if we are villains or necessity fools by heavenly compassion knaves thieves and treacherers by spherical predominance drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star
3423396 to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget them to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself
3423397 that was the ultimate subtlety consciously to induce unconsciousness and then once again to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you have just performed even to understand the word doublethink involved the use of doublethink

3423401 there is wisdom in taking serious steps with great caution and hesitation but caution and hesitation have their limits and we have now passed them have taken leave of all sense of decency we would only be betraying our unworthiness and cowardice if we cannot stake our all in the face of the conflagration which envelopes us and sit watching it with folded hands

3423409 if vodafone itself admits that it is standard practice then it stands to reason that the same practice applied to gt and we will like to know the people who are playing that role for vodafone and what they are getting out of it it is based on vodafones own admission
3423410 given the lack of transparency that has characterized this whole transaction is it not surprising that a company with a history of shady shadowy of corrupt officials is being given 70 shares in a state owned company
3423411 my brother go and ask how many of them use gt onetouch mobile network and you will realize they are being hypocritical who do they expect to use gt network for the company to get money to improve services and expand the network coverage they are only playing politics with the sale

3423421 bob has received the crown of righteousness and he has heard the lord say well done good and faithful servant
3423422 imply that the body is not destined to participate in eternal life
3423423 until he puts on that dwelling eternal home paul and all believers groan along with the whole creation
3423424 a christian who dies most certainly is in some important sense at home with the lord but at death the believer does not go to his or her eternal home not yet
3423425 implies that the resurrection of the body is an afterthought
3423426 the blessed condition of the dead believers is rest paradise a being with the lord but it will not always be that way
3423427 things will change on the last day also for the dead they will be raised and in that condition we will always be with the lord 1 thess 4 17
3423428 this is perhaps the most objectionable of all and it is patently false as even many unbelievers instinctively know it is true of course that when a christian dies he is now out of danger he can no longer be tempted in addition when tragic and prolonged physical or mental suffering precede the death of a christian there can be great relief and release for both the deceased and for those who loved him and have cared for him
3423429 the death even of a christian is always and only a sign that sin has not yet fully been abolished by the lord jesus christ the last enemy has not yet gone under his feet
3423430 the law is there staring everyone in the face death and the sermon should speak explicitly of sin and its effects and its manifestations including the death of this brother or sister and one can also proclaim the biblical message of the soul of the dead christian the soul is with christ or at rest or in paradise these are biblical ways of speaking and they can offer true christian comfort
3423431 the pastor must proclaim the good news of gods solution to sin and all its effects and gods solution for bodily death is bodily resurrection the resurrection of jesus is the first fruits of the final resurrection on the last day and this is very good news indeed for all who are in christ jesus
3423432 there may be people out there who believe his story but so far i havent met any everyone has questions about when this actually started up and whether she did on the payroll as after and there have been various reports showing a timeline suggesting she went on the payroll after the relationship started about the paternity of the child about the money payments since then and now there are questions of course about whether john edwards himself was a victim to some degree whether he was set up at the beverly hilton perhaps even by her friend
3423433 i do think its one of the central questions here there had been people who have traced out the timelines that suggested that their relationship did indeed start before he put her on the payroll that he paid her out of his pack money that this was money he had taken from others for various political purposes and for his campaign against poverty and therefore he betrayed the donors but i must say that there is a much larger sense of betrayal here that hangs over this and that is having run had he won the nomination of the party all sorts of people are now asking the question we talked about friday and that is what if this had blown up at any time along the way would somebody else have been nominated and if it had blown up very late would he have cost his party if he had been the nominee of the party would he have cost his party a chance to take this one
3423434 well other than the question of barack obamas vice presidential candidate its about the only story the press has to deal with over the next two weeks so i think its interesting how the press is coming back to the hillary clinton story as you know i continue to believe that hillary clinton ought to be on the short list and be very seriously considered for the vice presidential spot
3423435 personally im in chicago and my impression on the obama campaign is that she is not and i think theyre scrambling to make sure that she is honored at the convention i do think chelsea is likely to introduce her now and there will be a magic moment and that will be a chance to have quote a catharsis that she thinks is necessary at the convention it will be a big big rally for her at that moment and then her husband will have a chance to speak so theyre going to get plenty of major major airtime but the reports from the field are and i run into this all the time now there are an awful lot of people out there who are hillary supporters especially older women who are not yet reconciled to the obama candidacy who are resisting it in a variety of ways and i think they still have a job to do on both sides the clinton side as well as the obama side to bring this together and the convention is going to be critical

3423489 this is the first time that anyone has proven that brightly coloured insects associate with active plants more than they do with inactive plants
3423490 one could go into the field and scan wild insect populations

3423534 no matter how much you train for it you cannot recreate this situation
3423535 it only comes round once every four years and you only have that one off chance
3423536 i did make the final and i was pleased to do that you always come to win you always want a medal but a lot of people would have loved to have been in my shoes ive been to four olympics made three finals and won a gold medal so i dont think ive done too badly over the years another olympic medal would have been fantastic but ive come here tried my hardest and i havent got one so back to the drawing board
3423537 being a soldier in the us army i do what is expected of me
3423538 they asked me to come to beijing and win the gold i dont know how better to represent them than by doing that

3423540 when youre as good as we are you dont want to put any pressure on yourself
3423541 the olympic games are only once every four years and youve got to do what you can
3423542 and i did that but ive never pushed through pain like that before if it had been any competition other than the olympics i would have withdrawn
3423543 at one point before we came out here michaela did say to me i dont know if i can do this i dont know if i can do the clean and jerk
3423544 i was under no illusions it was going to be an easy competition and position was kind of irrelevant
3423545 if id come out for my last snatch i probably wouldnt have been able to make it through the clean and jerk the pain has really limited my ability to clean and jerk in training so that was really just a case of saving something
3423546 ive gone through a whole rollercoaster of thinking i wasnt going to go then getting a place then getting the problem with my back so im disappointed but chuffed at the same time now id like to defend my commonwealth title in 2010 and then aim for london 2012

3423567 almost one third of u s homeowners who bought in the last five years now owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth
3423568 it is widely thought the zillow valuation estimates are high because they do not take in account many of the actual foreclosure related sales that made up some 42 of all sales in the state of ca last month and even a larger percentage in other bubble states
3423569 almost one third of u s homeowners who bought in the last five years now owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth according to zillow com an internet provider of home valuations second quarter home prices fell 9 9 percent from a year earlier giving 29 percent of owners negative equity said zillow the seattle based service that offers values for more than 80 million homes for those who bought at the 2006 peak of the housing market 45 percent are now underwater zillow said negative equity and declining prices are making it difficult for homeowners to sell property for a profit almost one quarter of u s homes sold in the past year were for a loss zillow said that contributes to the foreclosure rate because some homeowners cant absorb the loss and end up surrendering their homes to the bank that holds the mortgage said stan humphries zillows vice president of data and analytics for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation humphries said in an interview it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices the highest percentages of homeowners with negative equity were located in california in four of the states metropolitan areas stockton modesto merced and vallejo fairfield the number of homeowners whose mortgage debts exceeded the values of their properties topped 90 percent zillow said in five more california areas the inland empire riverside san bernardino bakersfield yuba city el centro and madera the percentages were more than 80 percent foreclosure sales in stockton and modesto more than half the sales in the second quarter were of foreclosed homes zillow said almost 15 percent of sales nationwide were foreclosures the company said prices fell on a year over year basis in 140 out of 165 markets zillow said pittsburgh oklahoma city and austin texas were among the markets that saw rising home values the company said the 9 9 percent decline in home values was the largest on a year over year basis in at least 12 years zillow said the median home price of 206 919 was the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2004 the company said sellers are starting to adjust their expectations zillow chief financial officer spencer rascoff said in a bloomberg tv interview more sellers accepting a loss is actually a sign of optimism it means that the transactions might start happening there are so many sales contingent upon the buyer selling their home the zillow home value index is the median valuation for a given geographic area on a given day and includes the value of all single family residences condominiums and cooperatives regardless of whether they sold within a given period the company said the index at the national and metropolitan area levels is calculated using a weighted average of the median home value for each county zillow said
3423570 in a blind taste test i dont think id say it was pizza
3423571 its kinda like pizza combos that same artificial pizza flavor
3423572 any pizza flavored chip kinda tastes the same some sort of pseudo tomato pseudo oregano taste
3423573 all pizza flavored foodstuffs taste the same i think these companies all use the same recipe its not bad but its nothing i would pick up to eat
3423574 an unholy alliance of sausage pizza powder and a pringles chip freakishly accurate taste however
3423575 pizza sauce cheese meat flavors its got everything a za has to offer except warmth and fulfillment
3423576 if pizza flavored pringles are the best tasting food on your table you should get a new table
3423577 i had a second helping of these though im not sure why they taste okay but i think id seriously regret having more than a few of them they dont have much of a flavor but its pleasant enough
3423578 strong vinegar aroma and initial flavor gives way to sweet spiciness kinda miss the chicken
3423579 exactly like louisiana hot sauce probably worthy of a lawsuit
3423580 yeah they taste like rotten on the way in and cinnamon toast crunch on the way out
3423581 why do we need this in chip form french fries are readily available everywhere these taste as unnecessary as they are
3423582 its a long chip like a flat frito light salty sour dusting does remind me of ketchup hardly an accomplishment great if you like ketchup but its not like you cant buy ketchup
3423583 doesnt accurately recreate the burger king fry experience why would bk put their name on something like this if this is what r amp d thinks french fries taste like they must be shoving the fries in the wrong hole
3423584 dear god these are awful my stomach actually cramped when i started chewing more would induce vomiting
3423585 of all the bad things weve eaten nothing has made me actually want to vomit as much as the herrs ketchup chips
3423586 i dont actually hate these theyre definitely weird and it wouldnt be something id want to eat every day but i could see me getting a craving for these once in a while
3423587 the sweetness is a little off putting but if you eat it in a ketchup mindframe instead of expecting a potato chip its pretty accurate
3423588 just plain awful dull tomato flavor and overly sweet overtones makes it difficult to finish yeech
3423589 no theyre goldfish crackers they taste exactly like goldfish crackers
3423590 i dont know im not getting much of a cheese taste at all tastes more like im eating undercooked pasta
3423591 these taste like nothing the cheese flavor is so minimal as to be non existent whats the point
3423592 youd expect this to taste mostly like cheese but it doesnt the cheese flavor doesnt even arrive until a few seconds after you pop it in your mouth and its super subtle
3423593 i think kraft spent more time on packaging and shaping the crackers than they did on taste
3423594 maybe if the chips were served wet it would taste more like the real thing how about kraft mac amp cheese cereal im just throwing out ideas

3423601 not all online vendors though would be compelled by state laws to collect digital download taxes from their customers
3423602 digital download taxes have also been criticized for running businesses out of state michelle steel a member of californias board of equalization wrote in an
3423603 golden state retailers would be at a competitive disadvantage to out of state companies
3423604 for those companies that do have a physical presence in many states like apple it can be a logistical headache to comply with digital download tax laws in multiple states thats because many states have varied definitions of what constitutes a digital download and how they may be taxed
3423605 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging

3423649 its systems go for charter change and we are supporting joint congressional resolution 10 which is pending in the senate
3423650 so its not correct to say that the cat is out of bag right now when she has been saying this when she campaigned for president she supported it
3423651 i would like to say that resolution 10 speaks only of a federal system it does not deal with the adoption of a parliamentary system under which gloria can conceivably extend her term by running for prime minister
3423652 there may be truth to the insinuation that the peace agreement that the administration has worked out with the moro islamic liberation front may be used by malaca ang as a pretense to amend the constitution to enable mrs arroyo to circumvent the constitutional ban against her reelection

3423700 it is a carefully done study that strongly confirms the relationship between salt and hypertension high blood pressure
3423701 the power of this study is that it includes a very large cohort
3423702 the study clearly showed that people who had elevated salt intake were the ones who had high blood pressure that was independent of the genotype for this specific gene
3423703 the hypothesis they tested was reasonable but they only tested one gene
3423704 this is telling you that being a runner being active is going to reduce your disability and its going to increase your survival late in life you still see the benefit of vigorous activity
3423705 illness would be compressed between later age of onset and age of death and that paradigm was controversial because it went against conventional wisdom and had no proof
3423706 vigorous activity has a really dramatic impact but we cant ignore that there are also helpful benefits to people who are active at all levels meaning those people who are just out walking its so important to be physically active your whole life not just in your 20s or 40s but forever

3423708 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3423709 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3423710 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3423711 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married
3423712 i think this study demonstrates that the problem of refractive eyesight errors is on the increase particularly in terms of the amount of nearsightedness in the american population
3423713 no one knows for sure what accounts for this but its a pretty smart hypothesis that the increased amount of near work that were doing as a population may be increasing the incidence of nearsightedness and it does suggest that we should be looking into ways to deal with it
3423714 i would hazard to suggest that in general the widespread prevalence of refractive issues today could be related to environmental factors like extensive use of tv and computers and among the young video games because today we get much heavier loads on our eyes from all of that and those are strenuous activities for our vision
3423715 half the u s population needs glasses of some sort so this does not strike me as unusual at all

3423797 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
3423798 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
3423799 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
3423800 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
3423801 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
3423802 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
3423803 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
3423804 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
3423805 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
3423806 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
3423807 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
3423808 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
3423809 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
3423810 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
3423811 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
3423812 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
3423813 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
3423814 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
3423815 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
3423816 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
3423817 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
3423818 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
3423819 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
3423820 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
3423821 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
3423822 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
3423823 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
3423824 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
3423825 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
3423826 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
3423827 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
3423828 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
3423829 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
3423830 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
3423831 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
3423832 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
3423833 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
3423834 weve worked with russia in terms of the wto accession and they still have a ways to go so its not as though theyre close to it they still have some work to do before they get to it
3423835 we should convene other international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3423836 we are making progress on the last details of the negotiations i think it is important to finish this up
3423837 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3423838 myself and johns two sons would not feel safe for the rest of out lives
3423839 with his one act of violence chapman managed to change my whole life devastate his sons and bring deep sorrow and fear to the world

3423872 in 1999 or 2000 chuck hawke an attendant working in the visiting clubhouse in kansas city found syringes and vials that were hidden in an oakley sunglasses bag when he was unpacking luggage for david segui
3423873 according to radomski deca durabolin was seguis steroid of choice in the 1990s because it was safe did not expire for three to four years and was thought to help alleviate joint pain
3423874 mcnamee first learned about kirk radomski through david segui during the 2000 season
3423875 kirk radomski recalled meeting mcnamee through david segui radomski confirmed that he supplied mcnamee with human growth hormone and anabolic steroids from 2000 to 2004
3423876 radomski believed that santangelo was referred to him by david segui when both played for the expos between 1995 and 1997
3423877 according to radomski he was introduced to lansing by david segui while segui and lansing played together with the expos radomski produced two 1 000 money orders from lansing retrieved from his bank made payable to radomski both were dated february 5 2002
3423878 hairston was referred to radomski by david segui his teammate on the orioles from 2002 to 2004 radomski said that he sold human growth hormone to hairston on two or three occasions during 2003 and 2004

3423880 we were in bed and my wife yells skunk shut the windows
3423881 between earth and heaven mont saint michel and sacred mounts around the world
3423882 they both really want that fight they both want to fight each other
3423883 im going to let that fight happen and then ill figure out what were going to do at 155
3423884 i want to be a real champion i want to be the best in the world
3423885 and to be the best in the world you need to fight the best in the world and i want to give a shot to everybody that deserves it b j penn deserves it hes an incredible fighter
3423886 this is a big fight and they both want it and i think everybody wants to see it
3423887 some lady showed sample images of caf style starbucks nestled in parks public buildings with small inscriptions recognizing corporate donors and shops selling city related merchandise logos were all relatively small while banners advertising slogans and catch phrases were virtually non existent
3423888 we know that were in a period of transition with the end of a generation
3423889 the young players who came to the euros experienced the bad side of things it will be useful for the future they know what they have to do to avoid a repeat
3423890 with sweden were going to prepare the final two matches for the qualifiers we mustnt think of what will happen afterwards of my role otherwise how can we prevent the players from thinking about it as well
3423891 theres a foil strip it goes all across the paper this one has the foil as well but not all across the bill that way i know this bill is a 10 and this is a 5
3423892 a huge part of participating in society is being able to go out and spend money and know which money youre spending
3423893 thats all we as blind and visually impaired people want
3423894 thats the great thing about competition you beat us and well come back around the team that loses never forgets
3423895 we also understand this is pool play but at the same time this team right here weve lost one game in two years and greece is the only one to beat us so far so we definitely feel like we owe them
3423896 from that game ever since then weve been working on the pick and roll defense
3423897 its like a real good hitter in baseball sometimes you dont get hits and then all of a sudden you break out
3423898 usa in 2006 2008 is a great team we know that and we know its good for us to play in this high level

3423905 i am looking forward to making my debut for strikeforce at the playboy mansion an incredible venue that is well known throughout the world
3423906 joe riggs is a tremendous competitor his style is aggressive like mine so i have no doubt that our fight will be an exciting and memorable one
3423907 im really excited to be healthy again and looking forward to getting back on top
3423908 thats the great thing about competition you beat us and well come back around the team that loses never forgets
3423909 we also understand this is pool play but at the same time this team right here weve lost one game in two years and greece is the only one to beat us so far so we definitely feel like we owe them
3423910 from that game ever since then weve been working on the pick and roll defense
3423911 its like a real good hitter in baseball sometimes you dont get hits and then all of a sudden you break out
3423912 usa in 2006 2008 is a great team we know that and we know its good for us to play in this high level
3423913 we had been through a lot over the last eight years
3423914 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3423915 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3423916 thats why im glad finals are in the morning because you wake up you race and youre not sitting around thinking about it all day
3423917 i am overjoyed by the fact that i have brought joy to our dear general

3423921 we found that out friday night when he didnt show up for weigh ins
3423922 the commission doesnt allow last minute replacements so i didnt get a fight
3423923 the next couple of years ill be in the wec for sure if i dont get cut
3423924 im going to go in there mix it up and make my mark
3423925 theres a lot of fighters i think i match up well with in the wec a lot of guys are willing to stand and trade so its going to make for some exciting fights for sure
3423926 if they need a 155 pounder for the sept 10 show im down
3423927 im getting married in november so nothing can happen in november so itd have to be in december september or october im not sure whats going on if they have a show planned after sept 10 so ill just take it day by day for now
3423928 from fighting to the people ive met all the new friends i got to train with the guys in iowa just the exposure on a big scale was great
3423929 the team championship ring is definitely special to me its good to look back on for the memories and good times we had
3423930 the wec is a huge deal for me im very excited and almost speechless
3423931 as i said im going to go in there mix it up put on a good show right off the bat make my mark climb that ladder and try to make it to the top
3423932 i want to thank the fans and everybody thats supported me throughout the years and i also want to thank jeff curran for making this deal happen
3423933 just like skip we were fans of the team in the lean years in the 70s and the 80s

3423939 you all were the bass notes to the soundtrack of my fathers life
3423940 we scored six goals we created an enormous amount of opportunities which is reassuring what worries me a bit is that they scored two goals
3423941 from the first day the coach has stressed that the match against wisla is like a final the pre season work has been good and we expect to arrive at the match in the best possible condition

3423949 i was never saying that the ufc is bad if it wasnt for them if it wasnt for their 40 million in the hole you guys wouldnt be here we wouldnt be here we wouldnt be looked at as professional athletes
3423950 all i was saying is that from a financial point of view basically like a retirement plan or whatever that i can only do this for so many years
3423951 you saw the fight today look at jon fitch look at myself as a retirement plan we can only do this for so long and all i was saying is that as a business decision and you cant argue about this its in all businesses if another company offers you something better for you and your family you would do that its the logical thing to do and thats all i was saying
3423952 you should try out for that mom you used to dance
3423953 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance

3423966 there was more of share index related buying than anything else today we had major dollar demand from foreign banks and a mild demand from some corporates
3423967 the dollars strength overseas is affecting most asian currencies so that also is having some impact on sentiment the rupee should trade in a broad range of 42 20 to 42 50 through this week
3423968 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages

3423976 it broke my heart to see all the highway signs
3423977 if you are in burlington its insanely close to mtl
3423978 the renovations are gorgeous in the last picture the people
3423979 very nice i much prefer older buildings and they seem
3423980 thank you handsome weve got a lot of good stories
3423981 no no mirror shades your public demands shaula and neil
3423982 the main thing was to keep some consistency overall i was very pleased
3423983 we achieved our goal we tried to minimize the gap
3423984 playing the us was inspirational for us they are the best
3423985 we havent shot the ball well from the outside as a team since weve been here but im sure we will
3423986 if we start hitting threes we will be a lot better we havent really gotten hot yet and it hasnt affected the intensity of our defense that says a lot about our guys
3423987 our opponent is the strongest team in the world we tried our best
3423988 im sure the whole continent was watching when you play the us everybody is going to be watching you have to do something
3423989 losing by 20 to the usa is not bad at all they were great
3423990 we understand the nba is loved in the whole world
3423991 we are being watched on how we look and what we do we take that with a lot of pride
3423992 it was incredible watching the play where lebron james dunked the ball with his left hand after doing some air movements
3423993 im going to play very aggressively defensively be a leader and offensively attack and make plays for others
3423994 well chuck if thats the case then its a one and done for the dollar and it will go back to the weak dollar trend this week
3423995 one third of u s homeowners owe more than their houses are worth
3423996 hey chuck the price of oil is dropping isnt that great i thought you believed in that peak oil stuff
3423997 we believe this research will help local authorities boost their own recycling rates and to build on their existing successes wrap will continue to support local authorities in achieving this
3423998 feels like some kind of ride but its turning out just to be life going absolutely perfectly
3423999 train has not yet left penn station for unknown reasons
3424000 i do think the industry should petition to remove the spitzer initiatives because ultimately they hurt the competitiveness of our country by denying small companies the access to research analysts
3424001 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3424002 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3424003 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3424004 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3424005 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3424006 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3424007 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3424008 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3424009 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
3424010 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date so i said i dont follow the rules ooooh it was so good
3424011 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power
3424012 when he said to come he said drop a plumb line and establish a people that know me and that live for me
3424013 and then we compete with the world our god is better than yours our girls give better b jobs thats right we get laid twice as quick in christian school our gods better than your god
3424014 my desire is to see every man and woman on earth come to know jesus christ as their lord and personal savior
3424015 some people might like nothing more than to turn the whole world into an islamic state
3424016 yeah and its going to be a war right down to the end
3424017 for the most part church is just a nice outhouse you simply go once a week move your conscience bowels get a little relief and go back out and eat like a pig for another seven days thats why churches mainly stink
3424018 i dont accept what weve called christianity to date a lot of teaching goes on in the name of god very little living so the standard that i read in a relationship of god and of the word is if you love me youll obey me not if you love me youll learn about me
3424019 this year the workshop is focused on the design implementation and evaluation of search interfaces we are particularly interested in interfaces that support complex and exploratory search tasks
3424020 we men engage in shared solitude even in our most communal rituals we are alone
3424021 ha ha isnt it funny how men and women just will never get along or be able to communicate
3424022 offer the opportunity for transformation to a more optimal state of being or productivity
3424023 for most women its less a question of whos able to win its whether competing feels good and is worth the cost
3424024 he made it there okay but on the way back fate stepped in
3424025 he couldnt do up his seatbelt and when the truck went out of control there was nothing to hold him back
3424026 i mean as far as mechanical is concerned i believe it was okay but the seatbelt didnt work
3424027 were looking at the age of our fleet and were going to replace the age our oldest trucks
3424028 weve got lots of problems here it shouldnt be on the road this truck
3424029 weve been doing these inspections and weve been working with u haul over the last number of years and it can be very frustrating when we continue to see the same problems over and over and over and over again
3424030 i dont really think that its too much to ask that we expect vehicles that are operating on our highways to be in a safe condition my family drives on the roads with these same vehicles and it makes me nervous
3424031 well they were talking to us we just werent listening but they do have our attention now
3424032 they have done for some i have records of some of them some of the safetys being done for those vehicles but there are still an alarming number of license plates that we still have in our possession that they have not come back for
3424033 five times it jams on five times our contents go bashing forward into the front and then they have to tow it and all of the contents go spilling backwards
3424034 youre not going to believe what they said remove the parking brake completely and give them a couple of blocks
3424035 here we are with a truck that has no way to park anyway and now has no parking brake so youve got a twenty or thirty thousand pound truck with all our possessions that could roll away and kill someone
3424036 they dont care about what kind of harm they are doing people they dont care about what kind of trucks they put on the road
3424037 i got out of the truck right away and tried to open the hood and noticed there was a lot of smoke and i looked right underneath the engine and i could see fire dripping from underneath the engine
3424038 i saw actual flames coming out the side of the hood big flames and adam was saying its on fire and he went running down the highway flagging down cars i got the dog and we jumped out and backed away
3424039 the only thing u haul offered us was a replacement truck and that would have been an absolute waste because we had nothing to haul anymore an irony u haul still presented the family with a bill for the rental to the place where the truck was destroyed by fire
3424040 it was really scary i was just trying to keep the truck on the road
3424041 one went towards the middle of the median the other went in front of the truck around into the ditch and the truck literally bounced about eight or nine times in the air
3424042 absolutely not u haul takes safety very seriously and is not something that one can put a price on i mean u haul is committed to making sure and taking whatever steps it can to ensure this kind of incident doesnt occur again
3424043 u haul has reinforced its training and instruction to all of its dealers about the importance of following all of the guidelines and rules that are established by u haul for maintaining a safe fleet of trucks
3424044 what would happen at the end of the month when it was the busiest time of the season we were told if there were minor infractions pass it
3424045 lights that would be out back up lights not working marker lights out turn signals if one was out the other worked that was fine primarily we were told at the end of the month everything has to roll no matter what
3424046 yes definitely seatbelts that didnt connect or seatbelts that were missing or seatbelts that were hidden under seats because they werent working
3424047 i do not want anybody in an unsafe vehicle on our roads where there would be any consequences so if they dont clean up their act theyre gone
3424048 so we will be doing everything we can in cooperation with other provinces to make sure that as best we can we make this a national effort to make it clear that we expect u haul to operate at a far higher standard
3424049 if you look at our actual statistics with the ontario mto you will see that our performance has improved and is lower than their average for all people inspected last year so u haul is not putting unsafe vehicles on the road
3424050 that was incorrect the opp inspected the vehicle and found no fault
3424051 when the seatbelt was inspected by the forensic they could not find a problem with the seatbelt
3424052 gro gr er riesig sind nicht nur viele ketten und anh nger sondern auch ohrringe
3424053 when you give someone a mirror and let them see they have teeth again it is a very rewarding thing
3424054 i still put us at the top of the nfc
3424055 i feel confident in saying that because all the best teams are pretty much in our division the giants and cowboys are coming off great seasons and the redskins had a decent year

3424059 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3424060 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first
3424061 the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people

3424077 a person whos suffering at home from a psychological injury is as seriously wounded as somebody bleeding on the battlefield and we dont leave the people on the battlefield there to bleed
3424078 what we havent had is the close connection with veterans affairs and with the legion to identify some of the programs that are there for them
3424079 so this gave us an opportunity to talk about building that relationship between the ombudsmans office and our clients so that we can get some training to understand what the programs are that they offer and pass that knowledge on to our clients so they know where to link in

3424088 breathwork is a powerful approach to self exploration and healing that integrates insights from modern consciousness research anthropology various depth psychologies transpersonal psychology eastern spiritual practices and mystical traditions of the world
3424089 the process itself uses very simple means it combines accelerated breathing with evocative music with the eyes closed and lying on a mat each person uses their own breath and the music in the room to enter a non ordinary state of consciousness this state activates the natural inner healing process of the individuals psyche bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences with the inner healing intelligence guiding the process the quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for that particular time and place while recurring themes are common no two sessions are ever alike

3424115 we are adapting to a slowdown in private sector commercialspend which will be tighter in the second half and 2009

3424119 the market is doubting whether the u s rate cuts arehaving an effect
3424120 financial issues are getting hit today on worries about the credit market as always
3424121 but the market has come back a bit as oil prices have come down
3424122 until oil prices started coming down a few weeks ago there were twin worries of the economy slowing and inflation accelerating
3424123 now inflation worries are diminishing but we are still struggling with the growth side
3424124 unless it worsens the georgia russia conflict is having comparatively little impact compared to what it wouldve done had it happened in june
3424125 the fact that oil didnt go up immediately was partly a reflection of market sentiment and partly a reflection that the big pipeline had already been out of action before the hostilities started
3424126 the net result was not much change in the oil price
3424127 everybody thought the rest of the world was going to be immune from the slowdown in the economy and i think people are realizing this is not the case

3424132 the main consideration was the national interest the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3424133 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3424134 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3424135 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3424136 i am proud to have been chosen to sing at all
3424137 the united states and europe also need to take a hard look at their relationship with russia going forward

3424155 temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly
3424156 we heard loud and clear today how much people care about their gmail accounts
3424157 we followed all the e mails to our support team and user group we fielded phone calls from google apps customers and friends and we saw the many twitter posts we also heard from plenty of googlers who use gmail for company e mail we never take for granted the commitment weve made to running an e mail service that you can count on
3424158 conducting a full review of what went wrong and moving quickly to update our internal systems and procedures accordingly
3424159 but we wanted to make an exception in this case since so many people were impacted
3424160 google apps and the big switch dont worry about i t
3424161 their quick response shows their commitment to keep gmail up and running as smoothly as possible which should give users some assurance that google is highly committed to delivering a powerful e mail system that can be used by business users and consumers alike
3424162 this glitch has to be kept in the minds of enterprise users that are looking at gmail use within large companies
3424163 google needs to continue to provide the highest level of customer service and quality of service if they have any hopes of attracting large business customers
3424164 these growing pains which are more evident each day that we rely more on service based software efforts indicate that you cant really trust the cloud at this juncture its too early and providers are learning as they go
3424165 i have often been called a nazi and although it is unfair i dont let it bother me i dont let it bother me for one simple reason no one has ever had a sexual fantasy about being tied to a bed and ravished by a liberal
3424166 we were towing someone else next to him and he couldnt see the string
3424167 so it looked like he was being passed by a relative novice
3424168 most of the swimmers scream the first time they are hooked up on it
3424169 its such a feeling of fun going world record speeds or faster
3424170 the body needs to learn quickness more than force you put the athlete into a situation where things are happening fast where youre living on that edge and just have to use your instincts your brain will react and you quickly learn as you go
3424171 thats easy in skiing where you can always find a steeper mountain but in swimming there is no downhill you have to propel as well as reduce resistance gravity wont take you to the wall
3424172 we can program it to go five or 10 percent faster so they can feel what the next step feels like
3424173 you feel a big difference in the way the water flows around you
3424174 any small imperfections in your stroke you notice more youll feel more resistance in the water for me the head position was a huge thing i was able to change also tucking my hips in which helps with the rotation of the stroke numerous repeats with towing made it a habit for me to change some things
3424175 the best coach ive ever had he has a technique based program that if you engage yourself in can really help you improve whether youre doing towing or not
3424176 this one length shows her freestyle strokes the peaks are moments of high velocity or speed
3424177 hmmm its funny whats happening there is more variation in the beginning then the wave tightens up as she goes as i analyze it you can see there is a higher velocity average in here toward the middle of her lap
3424178 just remember to keep the long neck right and the abdominals should be tight you tend to arch a little bit think more about cutting through the water okay go
3424179 there are theories about what makes swimmers go faster but there is so little measurement in this sport
3424180 without this machine youd be looking at her stroke and could time a length or two at a time thats it you wouldnt really know what went into those laps
3424181 now we can really analyze her strokes and her streamlining that moment when she comes from underwater to the surface she races in about a week so were just getting ready for that
3424182 if you were building a destroyer at biw youd have a good idea how much fuel it would take to send the ship through either calm or rough water at varying knots
3424183 theyve tested it and can calculate it fairly well because the hull of the ship doesnt change
3424184 we move we bend we twist the body is squishy and beyond that even every swimmer is different they have a different size shape they have different mechanics what were trying to do is measure very directly whats going on with a particular body going through the water
3424185 i thought the men would latch onto this but the women have been more interested
3424186 thats ok some dont enjoy the pool investigator process some do
3424187 in the end we want these to be student driven projects
3424188 we hope to have kids on the team who could take their data files and start to analyze them in math and statistics classes then they can they can intentionally improve their swimming because they can measure this or that aspect of their strokes underwater they will have some tools to really learn things
3424189 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3424190 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you

3424257 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3424258 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

3424261 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3424262 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3424263 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3424264 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3424265 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3424266 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3424267 wir haben die bef rchtung dass hinter jedem einzelfall noch hunderte von anderen f llen stecken wo die leute sich nicht melden die sind genauso betroffen und werden unter umst nden ebenfalls abgezockt
3424268 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3424269 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3424270 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3424271 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3424272 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3424273 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3424274 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3424275 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3424276 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3424277 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3424278 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3424279 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3424280 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3424283 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3424284 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make demands on whether he is the appropriate person
3424285 the escalation on the part of the russia was disproportionate to their stated intentions
3424286 idea people seldom recognize boundaries between personal and professional lifestyles they seek style authenticity and craft whether at home or at the office coalesse opens the office door to the higher degrees of expression and comfort we have at home more than a new brand it is a new way of enlightening workplaces to inspire and reward ideas with selections that fit as naturally in the office as the living room
3424287 coalesse is reframing the current model and starting to bring more retail sensibility and ease of use to the contract furniture specifying and fulfillment process making it easier for both our professional and consumer buyers to acquire coalesse selections
3424288 on this the one month anniversary of nancys murder i want to express my absolute confidence that we will solve this terrible crime and bring the person or persons responsible to justice
3424289 while i will not comment on the specifics of our work i will say that i am very pleased with the progress were making and am very proud of the tireless and professional effort that is underway

3424300 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3424301 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3424302 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3424303 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3424304 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3424305 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3424306 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3424307 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3424309 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3424310 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3424311 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3424312 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3424313 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3424314 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3424315 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3424316 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3424317 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3424318 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3424319 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3424320 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3424321 the four leaders are working with their local business partners in markets around the world to build and distribute a pre loaded pc offering that features ibms open collaboration client solution occs including lotus notes lotus symphony and lotus sametime the linux operating system of each distributor and software applications and installation services from the local partners in each market
3424322 how come sun and openoffice org arent directly involved in this microsoft free pc effort is openoffice org assisting the effort at all
3424323 well yes theyre all using our software the openoffice org community maintains the openoffice org software assisted by generous sponsorship from sun ibm novell redflag red hat etc several of these companies then use the software as a base for their own products suns staroffice ibms symphony redflags redoffice canonical red hat and novell will now have distributions both with openoffice org and with ibms symphony that provides choice to their customers as they can choose which flavour of software suits them best the really good news is that both software packages use the iso approved opendocument format to store their documents so people can happily swap backwards and forwards between openoffice org and symphony without losing any data formatting etc the significant difference between openoffice org and ms office is microsofts marketing budget ibm also have considerable marketing budgets so hopefully this will help to redress the balance

3424325 while many within our industry are reporting earnings losses and are dramatically reducing their cash dividends we are very pleased to continue a pattern of positive earnings and to maintain a strong cash dividend we sincerely appreciate the confidence that our investors have placed in our stewardship and will continue our efforts to provide a proper return for that trust
3424326 our friend kate is beginning to recover in nairobi after a dramatic airlift from uganda shes not home yet but shes getting better
3424327 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3424328 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3424329 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3424330 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3424331 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3424332 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3424333 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3424334 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3424335 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3424336 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3424337 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3424338 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3424339 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3424340 he was lying to everyone about where his mother was because he knew what he did
3424341 he knew where her body was and he didnt want to be found out
3424342 but if youre going to make an accusation and take it to court you better have a solid investigation to back it up
3424343 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3424344 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3424345 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3424346 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3424347 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3424348 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3424349 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3424350 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3424351 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3424352 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take
3424353 it is easier to reshape a mountain or a river than a persons character
3424354 it is encouraging to know that parents are sitting down to discuss the basics of money management with their children financial education must begin at home
3424355 we hope that parents will use opportunities like back to school shopping time as a way to begin or continue the money conversation because learning about how to budget save and spend responsibly is critical for young people

3424366 id like to give you a piece of my mind
3424367 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

3424458 and of course i love helping people with their tech problems
3424459 the superintendent thinks a performance evaluation system is a key part of every organization to identify the people who are your top performers
3424460 nobody is being graded on anything now its just go to work and do what you want some people are not motivated to do anything
3424461 morale is not what the people are making it out to be
3424462 weve lost a lot of dedicated experienced officers its very sad seeing these guys go but i understand why theyre leaving
3424463 as soon as they started talking about it back in february we saw crime jump
3424464 criminals know were short staffed now were seeing people coming here from richmond and oakland because they think its fertile ground
3424465 i think for the police to say they cant handle certain crimes is completely irresponsible disrespectful and for people who live here very threatening
3424466 im here because i love vallejo but its a simple numbers game the more cops we have the more effective we can be
3424467 we just moved here from richmond and ive slept better than i have in years
3424468 theres not as many sirens or ambulances i feel much safer here and i think the police have been great
3424469 theres a lot of stuff going on in this town and i worry about the young people theres nothing for them to do but get in trouble
3424470 you can add another 100 officers and break ins will still happen because were in a tight economy
3424471 community policing and getting to know your neighbors is the way to reduce crime not putting more officers in cars
3424472 they say were the cash cow that broke the city its not true but the upshot is that we feel unwanted
3424473 ray errs when he compares a building and its builder with a human and his creator they are not the same thing

3424479 to be playing a player with a very low ranking in a very big pressure situation for me i have nothing to win only everything to lose

3424481 i played very well it was one of the best matches i have played
3424482 i took some painkillers to be able to play otherwise its quite sore
3424483 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3424484 some people are surprised that asian swimmers have won gold and silver at this olympics
3424485 but at this games i have won gold and silver and weve had zhang lin china win silver so we have shown the world that we can compete we got got medals and were both asian
3424486 i dont know what happened but when i looked back and saw a few smiling faces i realised i had done it
3424487 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3424488 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way
3424489 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal

3424497 you put your faith into your k 9 partner and he always followed through never letting you down
3424498 he was the greatest partner i had always willing to do a good job for you
3424499 every day hed watch out for me and vice versa
3424500 bridged the gap between the community and the police department
3424501 he loves to work its just in him hed rather be working than at home
3424502 the police department was gracious enough to allow me to be the first k 9 handler and i appreciate all the people involved in making that come true
3424503 it was one of the best moments in my career
3424504 theyve had a positive effect on the community saving somebody arresting somebody teaching people how to deal with dogs

3424538 obito you told me your mother rin died when you were young
3424539 yes she was robbed and attacked at home one night when me and aunt miyoko were in the town purchasing groceries
3424540 rin was a more than capable shinobi how could this happen
3424541 they werent ordinary burglars it was a team of rock ninjas they tracked rin down as possible danger to them and because of her vulnerability outside of konoha she was marked as an easy target
3424542 i think hell be o k just bring him in side and let him rest a little
3424543 whatever happened to you it really took a lot out of you what was that
3424544 im not positive yet but unfortunately it means one thing i must return to konoha i must learn to cope with this newfound power
3424545 id also like you to join me obito this has all struck me kind of fast but i think i think id like to be a part of your growing up
3424546 obtio has duties and responsibilities he has to resume here he wont leave not now and is probably confused as to why your leaving already he will understand eventually and sometime in the future im sure there will be a time when you two can come to terms

3424563 these guys all have the same bodies it s amazing stout buff compact gluteus muscles that could crack walnuts sorry stream of conscience here
3424564 needless to say we are extremely disappointed with these results
3424565 however this loss is a direct result of an additional 2 5 million increase to the allowance for loan losses for potential loan losses in a residential development on lake keowee in seneca south carolina we have a total of 4 9 million in secured loans to borrowers in this development we have classified this entire 4 9 million as non accrual and reversed the accrued interest and we have reserved a total of 3 0 million for possible losses related to these loans we are investigating whether fraud was involved in these loans and have filed a notice of loss under our financial institution bond though we can give no assurances that we will obtain any recovery on this claim we are also continuing to investigate other potential recovery alternatives
3424566 we believe this matter to be an isolated event while these non performing loans and the potential losses related thereto are real and affect our bottom line we do not believe this to be a typical occurrence for our company we continue to operate proactive and aggressive risk management systems emphasize credit quality and proactively address credit risks in our portfolio given current industry and market conditions asset growth is not a primary strategy of our company our current strategic objectives are to increase capital manage loan growth reduce portfolio concentration of construction and land development loans manage portfolio risk enhance credit management practices improve margins and lower our overall funding costs primarily through the growth of core deposits
3424567 while no company is immune to the effects of a downward economic cycle our management team is keenly focused on ensuring that we remain well capitalized
3424568 as of june 30 2008 the banks total risk based capital tier 1 risk based capital and leverage ratios of 10 26 9 01 and 8 16 respectively all exceed the well capitalized regulatory standards additionally communitysouth does not make or invest in sub prime mortgage loans and has no exposure in this area
3424569 despite the challenges present in the financial services industry and within our company we believe our strategic focus on capital asset quality and an enhanced funding structure will position communitysouth to meet the challenges ahead and emerge a stronger company
3424570 to go out there against all the odds with all the naysayers all the people who didnt think we could make it into team finals its incredible to know that we did what nobody believed
3424571 we went out there and competed with our hearts i think that made the difference i this this team has the biggest heart here maybe not the most talent but we did our jobs we stayed fired up and we fed off each other the whole time
3424572 yeah we had to whoop a nigga ass for like a hour straight

3424576 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population

3424592 what are you andrew homosexual because why else would you react so
3424593 from birth ive always loved music but it was not until i attended high school at the age of thirteen that i thought about it as something i could do myself
3424594 at that time i followed bounty killers style but then my friend warrior mark him said you have the potential you have the talent from there i started increasing my own thing and with encouragement from my peers and inspiration and ting the music started to flow

3424602 youre dealing with raw truth and believe it or not country and western and soul music are first cousins because its the voice of the common folk
3424603 when i first performed phoenix i was at a predominantly black club and i knew they didnt want to hear any glen campbell
3424604 i had to bring it to a level they could understand the club was packed and everybody was talking no one was listening so i tell the band the mar keys to hang on to this chord and i started doing this rap over it about what happened to the couple in the song that led to their breakup pretty soon the club is silent and people are listening to every word by the end of the song some of them are crying
3424605 every human being on this planet responds on an aesthetic level
3424606 music hovers in that band it doesnt matter if its glen campbell or shaft if it touches me i find a way to do it

3424617 the people are being pushed towards a revolution the indian government is not serious about resolving the kashmir issue
3424618 we do not have a single ampoule remaining in the central store on the wards there are some but the situation is dangerous
3424619 the whole issue was created by muslim separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley
3424620 the people of kashmir will not sit still over the death of our leaders if a leader like sheik abdul aziz is not safe what about the common man
3424621 there was a problem with the choke on the vehicle
3424622 it got stuck and so the driver was unable to control the vehicle and drove it into the wall to stop it causing people riding in the vehicle to be tossed they were treated for some lacerations cuts and one woman suffered two broken ribs
3424623 were contacting the manufacturer we had msha mine safety and health administration in there investigating and inspecting it they came to the same conclusion we believe we run a very safe mine unfortunately that involves a lot of heavy equipment and accidents happen this accident could have happened above ground on the road just as easily as it could have in a mine
3424624 i have a wonderful wife who is very capable and who knows maybe well have a surprise for you

3424626 im just glad that theyre there instead of the other people over here im very proud of them
3424627 im going to the guys at the fed that this is a good shot in the arm i think whats more important that we have to concentrate on the long term picture that being cut wasteful government spending
3424628 some people were walking past and just noticed them at it it was irrelevant that the glass was frosted
3424629 there was nothing left to the imagination and it was clear what was going on
3424630 there were people cheering and whooping yet they seemed not to notice obviously they had other things on their mind

3424632 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
3424633 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you
3424634 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
3424635 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
3424636 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
3424637 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
3424638 then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life

3424641 sorry something went wrong and the video could not be rated at this time
3424642 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3424643 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3424644 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3424645 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3424646 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3424647 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3424648 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3424649 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3424650 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3424651 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3424652 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3424653 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3424654 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3424655 another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3424656 i believe it is illegal and if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3424657 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3424658 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3424659 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3424660 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3424661 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects
3424662 the economy suffers people suffer rational environmental planning suffers some careful streamlining is long overdue
3424663 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law
3424664 the cumulative impact of these changes equals a full blown attack on americas premier conservation law we owe it to future generations to stop this attack and continue our legacy of protecting wildlife on the brink of extinction
3424665 so keep fightin for freedom and justice beloveds but dont you forget to have fun doin it lord let your laughter ring forth be outrageous ridicule the fraidy cats rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce and when you get through kickin ass and celebratin the sheer joy of a good fight be sure to tell those who come after how much fun it was
3424666 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3424667 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3424668 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3424669 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3424670 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3424671 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3424672 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3424673 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3424674 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3424675 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3424676 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3424677 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful

3424690 son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours
3424691 its something we would all like to be using a lot more but its really just starting
3424692 i felt like maybe i could talk to both sides
3424693 certainly in a museum youd like to be on the forefront of new activity and computer imaging would be at the forefront of what to do
3424694 now i come along as a copyist i cant do the original in one motion because im not van gogh
3424695 so i strike the brush multiple times to mimic the art
3424696 i guess the easiest way to think about it is youre a detective at a murder scene you got to collect a lot of evidence but you dont really know which piece of evidence is the one that cracks it open for you
3424697 thats the job so to speak of the conservators of the museum
3424698 were trying to understand the kind of creative process that the artist engaged in
3424699 were in the early days of what im expecting to be an important area for researchers
3424700 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3424701 i didnt realize it was the deadline said truini who was fired by parrishs office for among other things not submitting reports on time
3424702 we will have to take care of that kennedy said
3424703 a sense of belonging from castros cuba to the us senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3424704 i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii
3424705 i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification without that it cannot be marketed in britain what the rest of world does is up to them we need to ensure that modern and civilized values take priority rather than killing and maiming people
3424706 wii appeals to a wide range of audiences from children and teenagers to adult and senior citizens anyone from 5 95 as such there is a wide range of content for all ages and tastes available
3424707 will set the tone for each day of the convention
3424708 not only is this product produced from sustainable and renewable resources but is expected to be more cost effective than the current backsheets
3424709 wij verwijderen reacties die in strijd zijn met de wet
3424710 maar een uitspraak mag ethisch onverantwoord zijn wij vinden dat mensen daar op moeten kunnen reageren wij willen jongeren een podium bieden de kracht van het argument telt
3424711 en dat is zachtjes uitgedrukt maar je kan een reactie wel verwijderen maar dat geldt niet voor de gedachte van een persoon zo zijn er ook wel eens autochtone bezoekers die burgerdoden in irak toejuichen
3424712 our original plan was to review the companys financial package but we quickly realised that we could achieve greater efficiency gains through the implementation of an automated document management system
3424713 we were tasked with reducing the amount of paper that was physically being processed and stored in the business
3424714 by investigating the value of automating our inbound invoicing and billing we could comply with this business aim while also driving the larger corporate strategy of reducing costs and reducing our carbon footprint
3424715 while the relative number of quarterly broadband adds has certainly peaked the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of the traditional dsl service
3424716 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world
3424717 do not desire her beauty in your heart nor let her capture you with her eyelids
3424718 but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart
3424719 but i say walk by the spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh

3424738 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3424739 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3424740 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3424741 through lpga student centered education our teachers are trained to tailor their instruction based on the individual golfers goals personality and preferred learning style
3424742 each individual is definitely the focus of our golf instruction
3424743 for almost 50 years the lpga teaching and club professionals have been the grassroots ambassadors growing the game of golf and making the game more enjoyable by providing industry leading golf education to golfers of all skill levels
3424744 the significance of this list is that for the first time lpga teachers have been recognized and voted on by fellow lpga members
3424745 we have mutually agreed to cancel the 2009 and 2010 ginn tribute events
3424746 the popularity and interest of the lpga is at an all time high thanks in part to sponsors like bobby ginn we also appreciate all of the fan support that the lpga received in charleston and from throughout south carolina and look forward to returning to the south carolina market in the future
3424747 the golf tournament business is primarily fueled by economic support
3424748 we did everything in our power to generate the sponsorship necessary to continue with the ginn tribute but given the current market and corresponding cuts in corporate spending it was an uphill battle
3424749 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3424750 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3424751 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3424752 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3424753 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3424775 the use of shunra ve products has increased significantly in our organization over the past two years as we find more value in pre deployment testing over the emulated wan weve found that the accuracy of the shunra emulation tools is at least 95 of our real world network this accuracy and the speed at which we are able to get the data is critical for success and it is something we couldnt get from any other tool
3424776 the shunra ve application performance and analysis package is a critical advancement in shunras support of building network aware applications throughout all stages of the application development lifecycle
3424777 clients are seeing increased efficiencies as they provide network performance engineers qa analysts and application developers within their it group the ability to avoid costly performance bottlenecks extensive troubleshooting efforts and potential rollout failures this new package identifies and analyzes specific business transactions that will cause end user response time issues and provide actual depictions of real world network impact prior to deployment
3424778 it organizations working with additional resource constraints in tandem with increased performance demands benefit when new tools integrate in a seamless and non disruptive way
3424779 not only does shunras ve application performance analysis package transform the lan to a wan for real world testing into the testing environment it also uses tools and scripts that currently exist in the lab allowing it professionals to rapidly implement wan emulation with minimal resource demand

3424782 violence against women constitutes a severe violation of womens human rights
3424783 in this regard as minister of gender equality i have the honour to join in the say no to violence against women campaign
3424784 to prevent violence against women and to ensure the further protection of their human rights the government of the republic of korea has developed and implemented various measures such as legislation and support for victims for instance the act on the punishment of procuring prostitution and associated acts the act on the prevention of prostitution and protection of victims thereof and the comprehensive action plan to prevent prostitution have been legal and institutional frameworks for eliminating violence against women
3424785 your commitment to ending violence against women will be a significant contribution to our efforts in that direction it gives me great pleasure to know that the republic of korea is making the connection of this global campaign to the impact it can have at the national level

3424832 you have no idea what an honor this is is the rest of your team with you by any chance dr mckay that lovely young boy ronon
3424833 arent you you know going to demand that i kneel before you and all that sort of thing
3424834 it might make for a nice change if you knelt before me instead
3424835 i cant tell you what a great fan i am of yours colonel sheppard
3424836 a huge fan your adventures are so many and so varied
3424837 though i do not understand how there can be so many or that they can take place in seeming contradiction to each other or that you can have so many partners and yet still be in love with only one person at a time to be honest i think i prefer you with dr mckay although the times they have you paired with a third person as well
3424838 after all the wraith come off looking rather badly in these stories but dont your people have a saying where theres smoke theres fire
3424839 couldnt you i dont know persuade the writers to portray the wraith a little more fairly
3424840 and i would dearly love an explanation as to how so many timelines and mission outcomes can be so widely accepted i mean the variations on trinity alone
3424841 you know i really dont have any influence on the writers here
3424842 of course you do you have proven so deliciously defiant in all of our dealings with you im certain that you are just as stubborn and recalcitrant in these stories in fact i am certain that if someone tries to write you in a way that is contrary to your nature you simply refuse to go
3424843 if you could just give us a little expression of defiance maybe oh well okay confusion works nicely too
3424844 and now one of the two of us together oh thank you you are so kind
3424845 i was wondering if dr mckay could help me get a live journal account
3424846 oh for chrissakes not another nightmare let me guess the clowns again right
3424847 if youre going to keep this up colonel you can just go back to your own room some of us need to get more than two and half hours of shut eye every evening

3424853 i said im sorry it wont happen again well i actually cant promise it wont happen again but i can tell you that when it does ill be sorry then too
3424854 i get it okay i broke and thats a big no no i should have kept my mouth shut and let him do whatever he wanted i jeopardized the mission or whatever the hell you call it i get that and im sorry i tried i really tried but you being mad about it wont change what happened maybe if you included some techniques in our training then ill be able to do better next time
3424855 you think you think shit mckay you think im mad at you
3424856 hello genius here and it doesnt exactly take a genius to figure out why
3424857 well in this case the genius should return his mensa card
3424858 rodney jesus im not mad at you im mad at kolya and his men they had no right to touch you
3424859 it wasnt like he had many options elizabeth and i were the only two there
3424860 i know that was my fault next time no civilians are going to stay behind when we do an op like this youll teach some of the marines and me how to do what we have to do and youll gate offworld
3424861 rodney if somebody here should be apologizing its me youre a civilian and you shouldnt ever ever have to be in a situation like that thats why the military is here to make sure you dont ever have to go through something like that i messed up and you paid the price and im so damn sorry
3424862 so my only job is to sit in a little box while your guys absorb everything thats aimed at me
3424863 you dont have to sit in a box rodney but its our job to protect you thats the only reason were here
3424864 you heard me were in this together civilians and military
3424865 rodney there are some things civilians shouldnt ever have to go through and torture is really high on that list it should have been me or one of my guys not you
3424866 well it wasnt but putting me somewhere where my brains cant help you isnt the solution either it sucked ill admit that it hurt and it really really sucked but it happened im not going to let you stick us into little bubbles to keep us safe you need us out here and you need me on your team the only thing you should be pissed about is the fact that i broke
3424867 listen to me okay listen everybody has their breaking point everybody if you hadnt said anything because of the pain hed have started torturing elizabeth or killed her if somebody wants something badly enough they will find a way to get it
3424868 maybe not because of the knife but i would have eventually

3424884 the american taxpayers spend 10 billion a month to defend iraq and rebuild the country

3424887 we need to get america back on track and the way to do that is to make the economy work for the middle class again we cant keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq while we pay 113 per barrel it is time for the iraqi government to spend their own resources to rebuild iraq and not depend on the american taxpayer any longer

3425046 10 tracks of dark and droning layers of organ voice and electronics calling you from a mysterious place
3425047 glitchy cutting moving delicate sounds pop through the shifting noise hidden tunes appear an album that grows steadily more fascinating with every listen
3425048 the minotaure ep is a 20 minute exercise in raw dark noiserock from the dungeons of the bergen netherworld
3425049 first there was skkull then there was the drone drug continuing on the same path the sound of the drone drug is of a similar relentless minimalistic nature as its predesessor this could be seen as the electronic backbone to last years amazing blood spirits amp drums are singing conspiracy records creating a heavy beast with the most basic and stripped down use of variations in drones and frequencies instead of guitars and percussion monotonous motor humming via drugged out machinery and assaults of feedback attacking with a strong feel of claustrophobia compared to skkull the drone drug evolves more around a grim and abrasive sound constantly toying with lo fi aesthetics and a rough industrial edge the atmosphere created is thick and black bringing up visions of a dystopian society trembling on the edge of the world spreading the disease in a world slowly dying the drone drug is poison and affect you it will on this recording the skull defekts is joachim nordwall and henrik rylander 4 tracks cut by an unsharpened razor total playtime of 52 minutes 4 panel digipack with artwork by daniel fagerstr m
3425050 three solo offerings from half of the birds of delay unit luke younger everything comes together in a sort of calming yet virulent way like rivers of red and black filled with dead birds falling from the sky chrysalis is sort of like a anodynic end to all things one quick bite of the apocolypse that makes everything feel good
3425051 new born duo of eva aguila kevin shields gang wizard and britnay gould married in berdichev lay down some of the most beautiful hideous beautiful again experimental music around the two create juxtopositions of gently sung vocals with scrapyard convulsions layered overtop of each other with results that are next level hypnotic
3425052 the stay blazed team up of conneticuts chris donofrio and donovan fazzino get up in them guts with some comatose low blows spread out over twenty minutes tones get deep in the earth take a nap in the crust and are discovered years later when they forget to wake up bring a blanket and maybe a few coffin nails
3425053 two more doses of shiflet drone blazing here in the live variety recorded earlier this year in st louis and cleveland for those not in attendance you can acquire mikes sleeperhold synth styleings here and get a second chance to wipe your brain off of your shoulders
3425054 the sky done clouded over after glory fckn suns debut album yielding this brooding and corrosive follow up the new zealand sorta super group of antony milton ben spiers and simon ororke concoct a slow burning behemoth of metallic shivers and distortion churn dark enough to invoke the dread name haino spectra is an unsettling mind meld spiers desolate soundscapes bleed into miltons heavy drones which are complemented perfectly by ororkes restless percussion group improvisation is the natural language of these three even listing their solo and collaborative albums over the past decade would take way more effort than i can muster suffice to say this is a stellar and unique record to add to their massive discographies
3425055 the fourth album by the sample sculptor of finlands oulu features only one long piece of sound slowly and ponderously developing sound mass moves between minimalist ambient and melodic sequences both beautiful and mentally jarring it is both organic and spacy almost at the same time
3425056 all you need to remember is this never use a fancy word when a simple one will do
3425057 to date more than 12 million has been spent and 646 tons of marine debris have been removed
3425058 debris removal meanwhile has fallen to 35 tons a year since the islands became a monument about a third of the 102 tons that boats and divers collected on average before that including junk that was already there
3425059 and to be that young of age and already want to give back like that thats amazing she could have just sold the paintings on ebay and kept the money for herself

3425061 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3425062 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3425063 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3425064 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3425065 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3425066 the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3425067 we respect cobi hes stepping in and filling a void whether or not cobis comfortable being the head coach or whether or not he has the experience well play that one by ear cobi certainly will have a voice in this
3425068 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3425069 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start
3425070 here mom hold these keep them away from jakey theyre bombs
3425071 i need those bombs jakeys turned his into flying saucers and were going into outer space now
3425072 fine just be quiet youre going to wake up your sister

3425076 democrats are talking tougher on iran because they perceive it as a political necessity in my opinion
3425077 resolution could provide political cover if this administration decides to take action against iran
3425078 it doesnt help in terms of trying to deal with iran when you have an administration advocating attacks against iran
3425079 demands that the president initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic political and diplomatic pressure on iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by inter alia prohibiting the export to iran of all refined petroleum products imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons vehicles ships planes trains and cargo entering or departing iran and prohibiting the international movement of all iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of irans nuclear program
3425080 immense military resources would be required to implement such inspections of cargo moving through the seas on the ground and in the air
3425081 the international community has shown no willingness to join in such an activity without a security council resolution implementation of these measures could be construed as an act of war
3425082 implementation of measures called for in the resolution could complicate our operations in iraq and afghanistan and could cause oil prices to soar
3425083 assertions that the resolution constitutes a declaration of war are just absurd
3425084 it is with puzzlement that i find that some have described a non binding resolution that i have introduced along with mr pence and cosponsored by a majority of the house as a resolution declaring war and calling for a naval blockade
3425085 nothing could be further from the truth or my intent
3425086 as my colleagues know the resolution doesnt get presented to the president and it doesnt get signed and it thus does not either become law or have the force of law
3425087 whereas nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization of the use of force against iran
3425088 the sponsors argue that h con res 362 as a concurrent resolution does not have the force of law which is true but it clearly risks sending a message to the iranians the bush administration and the world that congress supports a more belligerent policy toward and potentially belligerent actions against iran
3425089 it is difficult to see how ships entering iran could be subjected to stringent inspection without the use of force
3425090 here the concurrent resolution is asking the president to do something which cannot possibly be done effectively without the use of force while disclaiming that it authorizes the use of force nice try but no cigar
3425091 if the us were to do unilaterally what clause 3 of h
3425092 the same thing goes for the sanctions called for in clause 2 i e they would constitute violations of the international law if applied unilaterally by the us that however is something the us could do unilaterally since it wouldnt require a security council resolution and the us doesnt give a damn about international law it would merely require an extension of the iran sanctions act
3425093 iran has already gained the regional power that these resolutions seek to prevent leaving diplomatic engagement the only way to proceed
3425094 demographically militarily every way you want to measure hegemony iran is the dominant power in the persian gulf
3425095 therefore weve got to come to recognize that weve got to deal with that and hope we can shape that to a responsible role in the gulf and the region and ultimately in the world the only way you do that is through diplomacy
3425096 the iaea has confirmed such illicit covert nuclear activities as the importation of uranium hexafluoride construction of a uranium enrichment facility experimentation with plutonium importation of centrifuge technology construction of centrifuges and importation of designs to convert highly enriched uranium gas into metal and shape it into the core of a nuclear weapon iran continues to expand the number of centrifuges at its enrichment facility as made evident by its announced intention to begin installation of 6 000 advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium in defiance of binding united nations security council resolutions demanding iran suspend enrichment activities the november 2007 national intelligence estimate reported that iran was secretly working on the design and manufacture of a nuclear warhead until at least 2003 but that iran could have enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon as soon as late 2009
3425097 some combination of threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures along with opportunities for iran to achieve its security prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways might if perceived by irans leaders as credible prompt tehran to extend the current halt to its nuclear weapons program
3425098 we have a situation where the iaea has published several technical reports all of which state there is no evidence iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program none zero
3425099 information has been provided to the iaea by member nations intelligence information now the iaea has to be very circumspect when it says this but we all know that its basically intelligence provided to the agency by the united states of america a nation openly hostile to iran a nation that has a track record of fabricating exaggerating and misrepresenting intelligence data the data thats been provided to the iaea has derived from a laptop computer which even the iaea claims is of questionable providence
3425100 the iaea cant go to iran with information that isnt serious
3425101 the iaea acknowledges that what its asking iran to answer has nothing to do with its mandate of the nuclear non proliferation treaty
3425102 this is purely cia instigated tripe when we get down to the nuts and bolts of the technical question of irans uranium enrichment program and whether or not theres any infrastructure in iran that supports a nuclear weapons program and the iaea technical find says there is none
3425103 can be construed to authorize forcible actions that violate fundamental principles of international law
3425104 the bills co sponsors really know what theyve signed onto
3425105 i dont believe most members of congress read the language of the resolution
3425106 if they did they would have realized that its sloppily written
3425107 over the past several weeks there has been a growing debate in congress the blogosphere and throughout the media about a controversial non binding resolution house concurrent resolution 362 which expresses the sense of congress regarding the threat irans nuclear pursuit poses to international peace stability in the middle east and the vital national security interests of the united states
3425108 in the coming weeks the house committee on foreign affairs of which i am a member may vote on house concurrent resolution 362
3425109 my rationale for originally supporting h con res 362 was to urge the bush administration to pursue a policy to place additional economic political and diplomatic pressure on iran as part of an international endeavor to prevent tehran from moving forward on its nuclear program
3425110 it is clear that despite carefully worded language in h
3425111 nothing in this resolution should be construed as an authorization of the use of force against iran
3425112 to that end i am not willing to leave even the
3425113 by recommending a naval blockade in the persian gulf congress could likely be responsible for oil prices approaching 200 a barrel which translates to nearly 7 50 a gallon of gas
3425114 if congress passes this resolution it will make a bad situation worse not only for the american economy but also for stability in middle east among factors contributing to short term oil prices are supply and demand market speculation and the value of the dollar risk of a natural or political catastrophe jeopardizes the production and flow of oil which also plays a major role in the price americans will have to pay at the pump
3425115 the naval blockade is the next step short of war
3425116 there is always some element of bad form in objecting to the destructive course of events or indeed in making it a topic of conversation thus in nazi germany even among those most closely identified with the final solution it was considered an act of discourtesy to talk about the killings
3425117 america still fields what is arguably the most disciplined humane military force in history a model of restraint compared with ancient armies that wallowed in the spoils of war or even more modern armies that heedlessly killed civilians and prisoners
3425118 the city is today totally ruined falluja is our dresden in iraq the population is full of rage
3425119 the american armys use of its massive fire power is so unrestrained that all us military operations are in reality the collective punishment of whole districts towns and cities
3425120 as untermenschen they are not concerned about the iraqi loss of life their attitude toward the iraqis is tragic it is awful
3425121 they were all civilians and had no links with taliban or al qaeda
3425122 in close quarter firefights where friendly soldiers could be wounded if bombs are used cannon fire and missiles are often the preferred alternative
3425123 however 47 civilians most of them women and children were killed when a us aircraft bombed a wedding party in eastern afghanistan on sunday an afghan government investigation has concluded the nine man investigation team found that only civilians were hit during the airstrike
3425124 a hundred per cent feminine very pretty very unassuming a
3425125 regional officials said the casualties were attending a wedding party and that the bride had been killed
3425126 i accept your point about not mentioning women and children although in my defence the story was linked to the new story and i didnt necessarily want to repeat the details
3425127 thanks for your response i appreciate it but something doesnt add up how often did the media provide us with the personal details name gender photo education work lives loved ones aspirations of the victims of the july 7 bomb attacks in london see here the july 6 atrocity in afghanistan has been reported a tiny handful of times in the press why would you be concerned about repeating the fact that almost all of the victims were women and children
3425128 the latest claim of civilian casualties puts yet more pressure on the afghan authorities and international forces to get it right when carrying out operations
3425129 yet more pressure on saddam hussein and the iraqi forces to get it right when carrying out operations in kuwait
3425130 the un said last month that nearly 700 afghan civilians had lost their lives in afghanistan this year about two thirds in attacks by militants and about 255 in military operations
3425131 kosovo albanians have been welcoming the return of armed kla soldiers
3425132 its these mistakes that cost the us the support of the afghan people
3425133 as is so often the case in this conflict its the iraqi civilian population which suffers the greatest loss of life either as a result of mistakes by the americans or far more frequently of course as a result of the bombs and the bullets of the insurgents
3425134 the more vulgar apologists for u s and israeli crimes solemnly explain that while arabs purposely kill people the u s and israel being democratic societies do not intend to do so their killings are just accidental ones hence not at the level of moral depravity of their adversaries
3425135 much as we do the ants we crush while walking down a street we are aware that it is likely to happen if we bother to think about it but we do not intend to kill them because they are not worthy of such consideration
3425136 this album has the vibe of dr feelgood girls interview with the pussycat dolls about their mtv movie award performance and their next album
3425137 beans lots of beans lots of beans lots of beans yeah

3425139 if a violation exists a violation exists were going to enforce a violation
3425140 it takes somebody getting killed before they will really look at doing a traffic light here and i find that unconscionable
3425141 the green suv we believe came though where the median break is and struck the white suv almost head on
3425142 a petition is going to be recommended and im going to participate in in getting a traffic at least a traffic study here and or a traffic light

3425150 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3425151 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3425152 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3425153 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that

3425155 hawkers from neighbouring slums have grown notorious for their unscrupulous and occasionally aggressive methods of pushing cheap trinkets or a horse ride on foreign visitors some tourists have also broken the rules climbing the uneven sides of the great pyramid of khufu the largest of the three and occasionally suffering a fatal fall

3425158 communications system on which shotspotter relies has yet to be restored
3425159 but article 10 of the same constitution also states that we have freedom of association and freedom of speech
3425160 its just like the responsibility in bringing up our children if we give them unlimited freedom chances are they will cause problems and end up as a nuisance to society
3425161 eftersom hon r som en mor till hela det thail ndska folket
3425162 what happened at that school constitutes race discrimination under federal anti discrimination laws that is why it is important that needs to be stopped
3425163 the problem public schools have is that it is a first amendment issue so public schools havent been very successful
3425164 this is not a case that implicates constitutional or statutory rights as no court has recognized a right to speak a foreign language at school
3425165 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3425166 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3425167 und jetzt kommen sie und fragen wie es uns geht gehen sie weiter und lassen sie uns einfach in ruhe sterben
3425168 was k nnen wir daf r wenn ein paar m chtige m nner sich streiten

3425172 initially they told me you dont stand a chance to win but we need to put someone on the ballot
3425173 as a totally new person working within a party that has not had a great deal of success in recent years i really felt i needed a coach
3425174 after his death 13 days before the election the campaign staff decided that paul would have wanted to keep organizing and keep fighting for the little guy
3425175 dont have that regular weekly or monthly reminder that we need to be out engaging the community building our base
3425176 vos ten s que ponerte en bolas al final no al principio
3425177 we have to see the october policy of the reserve bank to know the interest rate movements crude price is coming down and a good monsoon may help bring down food prices which would help in cooling inflation after october
3425178 inflation is likely to touch the 13 14 per cent mark by october but it may soften after that
3425179 we expect the wholesale price index wpi to continue in double digit figures till february next year and after which it will drop below that level and remain favourable beyond march 2009
3425180 after a rate hike in october another rise in interest rates may be expected in january next year if oil prices go back to their peak but it has lesser probability

3425182 now that the house and senate have agreed on a compromise bill we are so close
3425183 this is literally a life or death issue for millions of americans suffering from mental illness and addiction
3425184 and im grateful we are so close to enacting legislation for which weve fought so long and hard
3425185 the right has always understood the power of ideas the power of books as legitimizers of ideas
3425186 i see the opportunity with the book club structure to create a powerful tool to showcase the ideas of the left
3425187 outright barbarous how the violent language of the right poisons american democracy
3425188 when we started we were bringing people information about books that they wouldnt have heard about otherwise
3425189 now its much easier to get information and learn about books
3425190 its getting harder to get new members were holding steady but were not growing as much as wed like
3425191 has been able to shine a spotlight on the books that are in the club
3425192 founding faith providence politics and the birth of religious freedom in america
3425193 it was always sort of a fiction that you were in a club
3425194 it was just a marketing arrangement you never met the other people in your club now you can meet them i love the idea of people who are buying my book talking to each other
3425195 kellers campaign focused hard on ethics and campaign finance reform two particularly weak points for the incumbent who had been criticized for improperly diverting funds to the unm club rugby team
3425196 for five years i have heard promise after promise that congress will pass mental health parity legislation in my fathers honor
3425197 the american people should not have to wait any longer to receive the same access to treatment that members of congress have
3425198 constrain employers flexibility in plan offerings and ultimately cause employers to cut or curtail voluntary benefit offerings
3425199 with passage of this bill in the house we are one step closer to ending the discrimination against those who suffer from debilitating mental health disorders
3425200 we feel good about having senator wellstones name on it

3425216 theres all this talk about whether we should move right or move left
3425217 i say before we do that we need to move down down into the communities and into the grassroots
3425218 after knocking on their doors and actually talking to them i felt a stronger connection to them
3425219 i could just say to them i dont care who you vote for just vote

3425248 what if a politician were to see his job as that of an organizer as part teacher and part advocate one who does not sell voters short but who educates them about the real choices before them
3425249 since embarking on a political career obama hasnt forgotten the philosophical and practical lessons that he learned on the streets of chicago and that are now central to his campaign for the white house
3425250 its teaching people how to organize and mobilize people so they can build respectful coalitions
3425251 this is what i think a once in a lifetime opportunity we are thrilled to offer it
3425252 the main thing for me is i want to try to bring more grassroots groups together
3425253 its more about a community and really getting people together and it doesnt have to be so radical
3425254 what if a politician were to see his job as that of an organizer as part teacher and part advocate one who does not sell voters short but who educates them about the real choices before them
3425255 since embarking on a political career obama hasnt forgotten the philosophical and practical lessons that he learned on the streets of chicago and that are now central to his campaign for the white house
3425256 sometimes id get down about how difficult its been to get this passed
3425257 paul would always say jim remember it took 40 years for civil rights bills to get passed
3425258 but hed also be really proud davids got a great heart and hes doing everything he can to get this done
3425259 it feels good to work on this it brings back a lot of good memories
3425260 after the crash it was just a little too hard to try to live up to his name in minnesota
3425261 americas farmers have once again responded to adversity poised to produce the second largest corn crop in american history
3425262 the fact farmers together with americas biofuel producers continue to make significant contributions to a secure sustainable energy future for this nation while at the same time fulfilling their traditional role as food and feed providers the decision by epa to maintain the integrity of the renewable fuels standard as enacted by congress recognized this ability of the american farmer and fully appreciated the importance of the rfs to meet our nations energy and economic goals
3425263 i think the house bill would be a huge legacy for my dad
3425264 i know he would be opposed to the senate bill
3425265 obviously my father and i are trying to get the strongest bills through our respective chambers
3425266 the house bill is stronger in that it lets the medical community define mental illnesses rather than the insurance community
3425267 our bill has brought the senate bill together in a lot of ways
3425268 i dont think the senate bill would go as far it does had it not been for our bill
3425269 states have been very aggressive in going the extra mile we dont want to see that usurped by our work we want to see states be able to go further if they choose to
3425270 unequivocally protects the mandated mental health conditions covered by each state parity law including state medical management mandates and contractual arrangements
3425271 the senate parity bill gives 82 million people the assurance that their mental health benefit will be treated the same as their medical surgical benefit
3425272 it is a historic step forward in addressing the long standing discrimination against mental health
3425273 i wouldnt have wanted my dads name on that senate bill
3425274 it is a very strong bill that would end insurance discrimination against people with mental health illness and their families
3425275 party affiliation counts for less than i once guessed there are decent folks on both sides of the aisle take jim ramstad the guy is well really hes a total mensch
3425276 jim and i have fought like forever to win equal treatment for mental illness and addiction and im telling you hes just not giving up hes a recovering alcoholic he knows this stuff no big bucks insurance lobby will ever get him to back down i mean were definitely passing these bills next year no question but if it takes another 10 years that guy wont quit and neither will i
3425277 we do support our troops but theyre just caught in a bad situation
3425278 i know those arent any profound words but its the truth
3425279 the lesson of vietnam should be that half of the american troops killed in vietnam were killed after the generals knew the war was lost
3425280 he was not that way at all he was very subdued he was very matter of fact he knew what the deal was
3425281 we werent prepared when bush stood on that aircraft carrier and said mission accomplished if that had been true my son would have been alive today
3425282 and i hate to see young men lose their lives in a country that doesnt want us there
3425283 connecticut has probably one of the more advanced parity laws but it only applies to about a third of insurance holders
3425284 for those covered by group insurance there wouldnt be any benefits necessarily one way or the other
3425285 some people might have group coverage and still be in a self insured plan
3425286 the company itself kind of funds its own insurance costs
3425287 you may still have your coverage through aetna but rather than the insurer taking on the risk the company takes on the risk theyll have aetna serve as the third party administrator
3425288 our interest in this is that we want to be sure that anything that passes at the federal level doesnt pre empt doesnt negate some of our laws
3425289 we do have a fairly comprehensive mental health parity law
3425290 we are very hopeful that connecticuts mental health reform statutes are not undone or superseded by any federal statutes
3425291 if someone has a broken leg you know when its broken and you know when its fixed
3425292 its very difficult clinically to differentiate between people with depression and people who are sad it is in essence a self diagnosed illness
3425293 its not free if you make it appear to be free
3425294 not to make mental health special but to make it the same
3425295 there shouldnt be a disincentive for seeing the psychiatrist rather than seeing a doctor
3425296 with a commitment of advocating for those who were afraid to use their voice or who were unable to
3425297 having lived in the community for the past fifteen years ive been really disappointed that i havent seen our representatives taking on that role as advocates for the people i feel the voice that really needs to be reflected is the voice of the people and so it was a natural lead for me to move into this new venue and new opportunity
3425298 it just made complete sense we would do this as a team
3425299 when i considered running it was never a question of who i would ask i could count on them we have the same vision and passion
3425300 the skills that we were introduced to in three days i cant tell you how many times ive pulled pieces from that training and been able to use
3425301 you have to get out of your comfort zone enough to knock on a door at a training or face a press conference crisis
3425302 i had only done lobbying once in my life and was painfully shy about it however due to my experience at camp wellstone and the lobbying simulation i was able to feel confident enough to phone state legislators regarding a bill i was concerned about and give my message
3425303 i am putting to use the skills i got out of camp wellstone by meeting with public officials knowing how to perform gotv operations and staying on message for the upcoming battle
3425304 i think camp wellstone for me was another step in the process of me getting more active politically again
3425305 thanks to wellstone action for all your help and support especially moral support it feels like this will be our year
3425306 the camp was the best money my campaign has spent
3425307 my campaign is going great i have another camp wellstone grad who just drew up my field plan and we are implementing it
3425308 the wellstone training was extremely informative and innovative we are presently implementing the plans and strategies learned attending the st louis camp wellstone
3425309 in the run off week of campaigning we rolled up our sleeves dug deep into our camp wellstone handbook and burned off loads of elbow grease
3425310 camp wellstone was exactly what i needed to prepare for the campaign
3425311 the camp wellstone training was very helpful only wish my entire team had been able to attend
3425312 when are you coming back to ohio we need you
3425313 while i am a long time political activist there is only so much i can do by myself the wellstone training camp taught me how to teach others
3425314 i must say i learned much the weekend i was in kansas city for the wellstone camp
3425315 i really enjoyed learning about paul wellstones own personal outlook with regard to his integrity and political views
3425316 thank you for inspiring us for teaching us the tools necessary to win and for sharing with us the passion and knowledge of paul and sheila wellstone
3425317 thank you for this opportunity so many great connections so much inspiration so many new friends
3425318 thank you for showing me that it is possible to be a politician without compromising my progressive roots
3425319 this has given me the hope and inspiration i needed
3425320 i learned much but more importantly i felt and had the opportunity to contribute to an incredible driving progressive energy
3425321 this has been the most useful three days of my life it was amazing
3425322 this kind of thing gives us every hope in the world we can do anything really
3425323 when we lost the two of them and their daughter the two surviving sons got together with colleagues and close associates of the wellstones for many years and said what can we do to make this tragedy not so tragic by carrying on the work that paul and sheila did
3425324 they need to know how to do it they need to know how to organize on their issues how to have a message that communicates with the broader public how to get volunteers involved all the kind of skills which come with many years of organizing
3425325 this is a great opportunity to learn some leadership skills and strategies
3425326 and paul wellstone was a very inspirational and motivational person and so i think i can learn a lot from that this weekend
3425327 ive been working on campaigns for a long long time so thats what im doing
3425328 i am very concerned that a lot of citizens at least a lot of the citizens that im in contact with on a regular basis they dont really seem to follow politics that much they dont really seem to be very aware or active on civic duties
3425329 i want to inform myself so that i can hopefully motivate some of my fellow citizens and neighbors
3425330 im thinking about perhaps some studies in international relations or public policy so i thought this would be a good way to get information ive also thought about working with some candidates too so this is a great way to learn about all that at once
3425331 they gave me goldwaters the conscience of a conservative to read on the plane
3425332 paul replied that he too had read senator goldwaters book at a young age and explained
3425333 i also told them that i admired barry goldwater for his political integrity
3425334 people yearn for a politics of the center not the center so widely discussed by politicians and pundits in washington but rather a politics that speaks to the center of peoples lives affordable child care good education for children health security living wage jobs that will support families respect for the environment and human rights and clean elections and clean campaigns
3425335 the house always seemed dark to me even when the lights were on it was such a sad home
3425336 if i had a heart ailment they wouldnt think twice about sending me to a cardiologist
3425337 this isnt something ive chosen anymore than people who suffer from diabetes or heart disease chose their conditions
3425338 our country must make a commitment americans with mental illness deserve our understanding and they deserve excellent care they deserve a health care system that treats their illness with the same urgency as physical illness
3425339 inside the obama campaign an eclectic team of field organizers is attempting something that has long been considered impossible building a precinct level field organization large enough to affect the outcome of super tuesday now february 5 or super duper tuesday if successful aided by email lists web tools and old school organizing techniques long missing in electoral politics these organizers could rewrite the rules of presidential politics dramatically raise the profile of field organizing in the campaign world and help rebuild democratic party structure in states such as california that have been long forgotten to electoral field organizing
3425340 what gave obama an edge his strategists say was a heavy investment in grass roots organizing all campaigns try to build grass roots organizations especially those of charismatic challengers like obama but those efforts which often rely on neophyte volunteers whose enthusiasm exceeds their political skills often fade in the stretch obama sought to avoid that problem by organizing intensive regional training camps designed to help his volunteers function with near professional proficiency the precinct level operations were to employ theories of community organizing obama practiced in chicago before getting into electoral politics the purpose figueroa wrote is to provide supporters with the tools to create self sufficient interdependent teams that take responsibility for all aspects of a campaign within their congressional district trainers encourage volunteers to set up quasi independent local offices that tailor a personalized door to door pitch based on local circumstances or the latest campaign development
3425341 a minnesota politician named wellstone that encouraged college students from all over the country to come to minnesota and vote for him bring the proof or retract the slime

3425344 a very rare survival of a scottish medieval royal tomb
3425345 the french rulers the bishop informed the house while they despair of making any impression on us by force of arms attempt a more subtle and alarming warfare by endeavouring to enforce the influence of their example in order to taint and undermine the morals of our ingenious youth they have sent amongst us a number of female dancers who by the allurement of the most indecent attitudes and most wanton theatrical exhibitions succeed but too effectually in loosening and corrupting the moral feelings of the people

3425357 below inflation pay offers are unacceptable especially at this time of price rises pushing up the cost of living
3425358 the isle of man is disproportionately hit by current fuel increases and is currently experiencing inflation well above the rate of britain
3425359 manx telecom is well aware that their offer is effectively a pay cut for their employees
3425360 we will not settle for anything that does not represent an increase in real terms in our members take home pay

3425384 whether the character is a robot or a virtual creation the interaction issues are the same we need to figure out what sensors to build and how to interpret and respond to human behavior
3425385 the access disney provides to real world problems and data will enable us to do research with greater impact than is typically possible within a purely academic environment

3425389 the big ideas are fundamentally unpredictable if id been able to predict them i would have done them we never have things figured out entirely the one thing about this field and about filmmaking is that things dont stay the same i think people sometimes lose sight of that when something wonderful happens they hope that it doesnt change without fully recognizing that what made it exciting was that it was a period of change what makes these films challenging is that we dont repeat ourselves and were not supposed to repeat ourselves the way we keep things exciting is that we never stop to hang onto what weve got we move on to the next thing
3425390 why do practical effects instantly mean its better than cgi

3425404 were going up to compete against the best teams in the country were one of them so you know this is just icing on the cake for each additional step that we make
3425405 were going up there with the attitude that we could win this thing
3425406 i think for us just as long as they all do their best and have a great attitude theyve already won
3425407 its been the best days of my life pretty much
3425408 its like the funnest dream i could ever think of its unbelievable
3425409 its going to be a real lifetime experience because its with all of your friends and its on the way to the little league world series

3425412 cari amici grazie per tutto questi giorni finiscono ma porto con me un tesoro di ricordi
3425413 solo adesso vedo quale esercito di angeli custodi mi ha circondato
3425414 saluto tutti i cittadini di bressanone anche io adesso sono un cittadino di bressanone
3425415 paolo vi fra lostracismo del clero e quello dei mass media
3425416 qui ho trascorso giorni bellissimi ha detto il papa parlando a braccio in italiano e tedesco come tutte le cose belle anche questi giorni finiscono
3425417 al papa le vacanze a bressanone sono veramente piaciute ha detto il vescovo di bolzano bressanone mons wilhelm egger incontrando i giornalisti poco prima della partenza di benedetto xvi e lo ha espresso in pi occasioni in questi giorni ha potuto fare ci che pi desiderava stare in casa a leggere a studiare e passeggiare in giardino
3425418 il papa ha condotto una vita veramente ritirata ha aggiunto il vescovo ha trascorso molto tempo in camera sua ha incontrato alcuni amici
3425419 non un giardino ma un parco degno della regina dinghilterra
3425420 in questi giorni il papa ha espresso parole importanti per la nostra chiesa locale ha aggiunto mons egger condividendone le gioie e le preoccupazioni nellincontro con il clero ci ha donato una grande lezione di teologia sullo spirito santo e ha ricordato limpegno a favore della tutela dellambiente domenica scorsa poi durante langelus ha rammentato e caldeggiato il prossimo programma pastorale diocesano che sar incentrato sul significato della domenica come giorno di festa e di riposo
3425421 sono rimasto particolarmente colpito dalla cordialit con cui ha incontrato le persone dedicando a ciascuno unattenzione particolare ha proseguito il vescovo e questo in particolare verso i bambini e gli ammalati mi ha impressionato anche la sua capacit di spiegare con parole semplici i vangeli della domenica e le questioni teologiche
3425422 solo adesso mi accorgo ha esclamato benedetto xvi quanto sia grande lesercito di angeli custodi che ha vegliato su di me durante le mie vacanze

3425428 the first generation of e commerce software still prevalent in todays market was based on the traditional proprietary software model
3425429 this is software created by a staff of developers that is sold for hundreds or thousands of dollars and often requires monthly payments
3425430 prestashop on the other hand is a committed member of the open source software movement
3425431 and like other open source e commerce applications such as oscommerce prestashop is free its license osl 3 0 is one of the least restrictive and users arent even required to register first
3425432 businesses love prestashop because its easy to manage their online stores
3425433 customers love prestashop because its smooth web 2 0 interface is pleasant to shop on and software developers love prestashop because its easy to integrate and because the user community is very active and helpful for example prestashop users have already translated prestashop into over 20 different languages and its only at version 1 0
3425434 that was a perfect example of what to expect in this league
3425435 it wont be a walk in the park and i never said it was going to be easy it was a bit frantic to be honest and we just lacked that wee bit of quality in the final third which given who we had on the field i would expect a bit better from in the first 45 it was important to win
3425436 if we hadnt won can we still win the league of course but it was good in terms of giving the players their baptism in the championship and getting off to a victory
3425437 the next step is up to him hes young but youd like to think he has learned and matured when we met i think i was speaking to a determined guy who wants to be a star the world can be at your feet if you are a young player but you can hit a wall theres loads in his locker that can take him to another level and were trying to go to another level too
3425438 the players will know they are there to be shot at but its all down to confidence and belief itll be a measure of their character belief and attitude they cant think they can play the beautiful game and just soar straight through to the premier league

3425441 it made up of actual bomb components however one of the needed components to make it active was missing

3425443 there was a struggle that happened on the deck area going out to the portsmouth fire boat

3425445 he was transported to portsmouth regional hospital for treatment and released on personal recognizance bail while there
3425446 its really hard to handle people with these types of health issues in court because you need to show they have a culpable state of mind
3425447 they continue to allow the incidental take of canada lynx by state sanctioned trappers and will not do what the federal government has asked and requires of them and what the citizens of maine want from them

3425461 how come sun and openoffice org arent directly involved in this microsoft free pc effort is openoffice org assisting the effort at all
3425462 well yes theyre all using our software the openoffice org community maintains the openoffice org software assisted by generous sponsorship from sun ibm novell redflag red hat etc several of these companies then use the software as a base for their own products suns staroffice ibms symphony redflags redoffice canonical red hat and novell will now have distributions both with openoffice org and with ibms symphony that provides choice to their customers as they can choose which flavour of software suits them best the really good news is that both software packages use the iso approved opendocument format to store their documents so people can happily swap backwards and forwards between openoffice org and symphony without losing any data formatting etc the significant difference between openoffice org and ms office is microsofts marketing budget ibm also have considerable marketing budgets so hopefully this will help to redress the balance

3425614 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3425615 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3425616 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3425617 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3425618 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3425619 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3425620 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3425621 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3425820 the three major constituencies customers employees and stakeholders have all suffered due to his leadership
3425821 this is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from alpas illegal activity cited in our lawsuit which details the organised and concerted effort to harm our customers our employees and our performance

3425834 unfortunately poor minority and low achieving students are far more likely to be taught by an under qualified teacher than their more affluent white and high achieving peers
3425835 the students most in need of the most qualified teachers are the least likely to be taught by them
3425836 otherwise we will continue to have the inequity its not going to go away
3425837 its been shown that the most important factor in closing the achievement gaps is the work of an effective teacher we need to get as many as we can in the right places

3425851 the high export number is the standout and its one that if it continues implies a higher rate of gdp growth for the u s economy in q2 but lets not jump the gun economists sense theres a global economic slowing going on exports may have peaked as a result so this large increase in june may prove to be transitory

3425905 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3425906 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3425907 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community

3425909 this book delves deep into the link between opportunity and race as it pertains to entrepreneurial business owners
3425910 entrepreneurs are a vital part of the economy and it is important to know why some are succeeding and some are struggling
3425911 few gain important experience from working in a family owned business which stems in part from high rates of growing up in single parent families
3425912 currently 55 percent of african american children live with only one of their parents
3425913 will demystify some of the reasons for the disparity in the success rates of some minority businesses
3425914 i dont care if you are for or against it we need to get people talking about it
3425915 we have a moral responsibility to provide health care for people who dont have it
3425916 health care should be like social security part of the social contract
3425917 these stories give gods people glimpses into the many times when the doings of man threatened the existence of the covenant people and the line of the savior

3425930 we were tracking it earlier in that week and we knew that things were escalating
3425931 i can tell you it moved quicker than we anticipated that first day
3425932 i think a lot of what youre asking needs to be ironed out
3425933 some of these little issues are definitely still big questions in this event what was the intent who started it why did they start it and why werent they prepared to defend what they started
3425934 we dont see anything that supports they are in gori
3425935 once it did happen they were able to get the forces quickly and it was just a matter of taking the roads in so its not as though they were building up forces on the border waiting

3425941 we saw the reporting and the announcement from the russian president medvedev
3425942 were trying to get an assessment of what exactly it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3425943 we dont know what the russians are doing we want them to stop the attacks
3425944 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia

3425959 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
3425960 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development

3425969 oh cool i do like this bag but should we get it
3425970 its 1 595 but is it 1 595 cute or is it under a thousand cute
3425971 well its pony skin which is nice will our laptops fit into it though

3425974 if we do we should get different colors so we can swap
3425975 i know i mean it when i say it but i can never part with my bags
3425976 i like how it fits our laptops i hate lugging around my computer bag and a regular bag

3425983 weve been looking for ye all day yer mother been worried sick
3425984 father ive not meant to worry anybody but i have been here for quite some time
3425985 i simply heard some arguing in the middle of town and began to play a tune
3425986 ye dont look like yer fer feelin too well boy be something wrong with ye
3425987 aside from what mother has asked of me and allowing my curiosity to take hold of me that is
3425988 well the mayor be sayin a strange song was bein sung and suddenly everyone was all calm
3425989 i know you got the tendency to stick yer nose where it dont belong
3425990 father with all due respect i didnt do anything aside from my task
3425991 once i heard the initial words i contented myself with staying out of the affairs of adults
3425992 yer mother be wantin a word with ye afore ye take supper i suggest ye be gettin there
3425993 after you finish your meal here i must send you away to live with relatives of mine your father fears that fighting will begin soon and doesnt want the three of you to get entangled in it all i just dont feel right about it though youve yet to see thirteen years you shouldnt be moving away from your home

3425999 practice with your lyre so when you come back you can play it for me and sing me a beautiful song i want you to look after your sisters as well though they think they can take care of themselves they may need assistance from time to time
3426000 a man will meet you at the edge of town tonight and ask you for that medallion he will take you from here to the city and take you to my parents theyll likely want to see proof ive sent you so hold that medallion tight ive already packed your things but i want you to carry your lyre that way your guide will notice you more easily please eat now youll be walking for a couple hours before you find any repose
3426001 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded
3426002 older people have brought their cats in and surrendered them to us because they cant afford to feed them any more
3426003 it is expensive to own a pet it is not cheap
3426004 costs are going up and peoples income is not going up accordingly i guess that they have to make cutbacks in some areas and for some people that will be their animals
3426005 so people need to think carefully about the size of the dog that they go for
3426006 what is showing through is that were up in pretty much all areas for taranaki which is good
3426007 im not really surprised after the result of june there is always a bit of movement that happens there seems to be the rise and fall were lucky in taranaki because we are cushioned to some degree particularly with the dairying scene and the energy scene but generally its pretty good reading its nothing like sales of a couple of years ago but this is a good sign
3426008 there is an unmistakable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3426009 the fact is that for the market nationally to achieve an unchanged median price against the pressure of the declining auckland market is a remarkably good result in the circumstances and it is beginning to look like the june figures may have given a poor reading of the markets health
3426010 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought

3426018 la ue s lo puede satisfacer 50 por ciento de su demanda interna de pescado con sus propios recursos
3426019 los operadores pesqueros europeos en aguas senegalesas contribuyen significativamente a la sobreexplotaci n y ofrecen pocas ganancias de largo plazo para la industria
3426020 el n mero de piraguas cay de un m ximo de 10
3426021 muchas compa as pesqueras no est n trabajando a tiempo completo por la severa escasez de las especies de mayor valor el volumen promedio de las exportaciones cay 32 por ciento en los ltimos 15 a os lo cual provoc el despido de entre 50 y 60 por ciento de sus trabajadores
3426022 las compa as que operan con una licencia en regla rutinariamente exceden las cuotas que se les otorgaron ya que senegal carece de los recursos suficientes para patrullar sus aguas
3426023 las autoridades tambi n tienen problemas para controlar a los barcos que se mueven de una zona pesquera a otra correspondientes a distintas naciones
3426024 los propietarios de los buques de arrastre juegan con las distintas licencias y si no pueden obtener una en senegal la consiguen sin problema en un pa s vecino
3426025 un estudio realizada entre 1997 y 2001 en aguas territoriales de guinea indic que 60 por ciento de los 2 313 buques localizados estaban cometiendo alguna contravenci n en ese mismo per odo investigaciones similares en guinea bissau y sierra leona demostraron que 24 por ciento de los barcos en aguas de ambos pa ses operaban ilegalmente
3426026 lo que les permite evitar controles estrictos y tener acceso a aguas reservadas para los barcos de ese pa s

3426028 how a simple administrative matter was mishandled and how competitive politics led it to snowball into a violent stand off unleashing dangerous communal passions
3426029 is explained by vijay k sazawal in his article in outlook
3426030 etc which are usually thrown out like hand grenades by pdp
3426031 islam is a reality in kashmir which was chosen here by the people to liberate themselves from the highly oppressive social economic and religious order established by the brahaminical system
3426032 only non proprietary rights to the land and is explicit regarding the compensation that must precede any construction a payment of rs
3426033 it was clear to all parties that transfer process would not be complete until the land was demarcated and no construction would take place until the sasb made the advance payment of rs
3426034 blood will flow in streets of srinagar if a non valley politician becomes the chief minister
3426035 sasb had the responsibility to set the timing and define security needs for the yatra
3426036 had documents in its possession that the construction of pucca buildings was going on a war footing at dumhel one of the resting points for amaranath cave bound pilgrims
3426037 the sasb a creation of the state assembly eight years earlier got transformed by the media into
3426038 action committee against land transfer acalt and put mian abdul qayyum the former president of the kashmir bar council in charge
3426039 it is difficult to comprehend how a request to build brick and mortar lavatories at 10 000 ft altitude in an inhospitable area where not a tree grows and where it snows for nearly 8 months a year could be seen as a land give away that could provoke such a violent reaction
3426040 but this being kashmir where the powerful and the rich have succeeded in maintaining their authority and control by hatching conspiracy theories and seeding alienation while the poor pay the price and continue to stay poor
3426041 shah bano and his prophecy seems to be coming true the communal divide between srinagar and jammu between hindus and muslims has only deepened with this latest instance of criminal mishandling of what could have been a minor administrative matter
3426042 tried to cremate it using old tyres kerosene oil and liquor
3426043 sorry maam we cant fax to workplaces it has to be a secured fax

3426045 fine theres a fax machine sitting on my desk at home use that one
3426046 if youre running for office this year obviously you want to demonstrate that you can put up a record of accomplishment thats based upon working with both sides of the political aisle

3426057 i held out hope that the republicans in the general assembly would take this second chance to craft a transportation solution without
3426058 alas they seem determined to repeat their initial mistake and put the proverbial gun to the heads of local officials
3426059 the g a democrats wanted a gas tax hike then and sadly they still want one now there are ways to deal with transportation without shoveling piles of taxpayer money at the problem and hoping it goes away
3426060 the idea that northern virginians and hampton roads residents will sit still for hb3202 ii the sequel is insane meanwhile tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of virginia voters will wonder why the supposed party of limited government and low taxes will have helped to enact three tax increases in five years
3426061 voters in northern virginia and hampton roads made abundantly clear what they thought of these taxes and fees on november 6
3426062 republicans who supported them lost support and in many cases their jobs while republicans who opposed them gained support they wont take kindly to the gop bringing those old taxes back under new labels or less dubious constitutional authority
3426063 it was the defection of independents not conservatives that caused the democratic landslide in the congressional elections in 2006 their preference for democrats jumped to 57 percent in 2006 from 49 percent in 2004 john mccain must win many of them back since independents constitute nearly one third of the overall electorate
3426064 these boards are supposed to be fighting for their areas they should be parochial but they arent im blown away by their irresponsible attitude
3426065 i cannot understand why this group would want to turn down any opportunity to go for funding to help look after the standard of the districts rural roads
3426066 youve got to question why on earth weve got these community boards
3426067 its funny how you people can listen to debate and accept recommendations on what name should be given to a lake in a residential subdivision but you cant accept democracy in action at the community board meetings

3426072 es un mensaje muy dif cil de manejar a nivel poblacional
3426073 tienes que explicarle a la gente todos estos detalles adem s si el tratamiento antirretroviral deja de funcionar en el individuo afectado porque genera una resistencia ste va empezar a transmitir el virus

3426087 la gente que ya estaba en estado de subnutrici n o riesgo alimentario se manten a con el consumo m nimo pero ahora se est quedando sin nada por no poder absorber el costo de la alimentaci n
3426088 los programas asistenciales de tipo coyuntural contin a son claramente insuficientes una familia para estar cerca de la canasta b sica de consumo requiere de por lo menos tres salarios m nimos eso implica gastar cerca de 4 mil 500 pesos de modo que los 350 120 pesos destinados por los programas calderonistas est n muy lejos de abatir el problema alimentario entre las familias m s pobres sobre todo en las zonas donde hay posibilidad de hambruna
3426089 m s que medida emergente comenta resulta una broma de mal gusto esos alimentos que el gobierno congel no son representativos de la canasta b sica de la mayor a de los mexicanos qu tienen que ver el chilorio el mango en alm bar los jalape os enlatados las mermeladas si dejaron fuera el ma z el trigo el frijol la leche y la carne los primeros no tienen ning n impacto positivo s lo tienen un efecto medi tico

3426096 se han tomado dos tipos de medidas que son tambi n limitadas se ha dicho que se extiende el programa alimentario para zonas marginadas pero resulta muy costoso llegar a poblaciones de menos de 500 habitantes dado que no existe infraestructura para proporcionar alimentaci n ni transferencias en efectivo es muy factible que no alcance

3426133 here we are all of a sudden in the 60th year after democratic party over a simple thing something almost unheard of because he did not want the armed forces to be integrated
3426134 here we are 45 years after the i have a dream speech forty years after the assassinations of kennedy and king and this party that i have been a part of for so long this party that has been accused of taking black people for granted is about to deliver the nomination for the nations highest office to an african american how do you describe that all those days in jail cells wondering if anything you were doing was even going to have an impact
3426135 but ive got a head too and in the beginning my head was with clinton the conventional wisdom was that this thing was going to be over in february
3426136 youd be real embarrassed if he won and you wasnt down with it
3426137 conversations like those i had with clyburn and lewis however begin to illuminate just how emotionally complicated such internal deliberations were
3426138 if anybody tells you they expected this result theyre not being honest with you
3426139 of course i would support someone i knew and had liked and had worked with versus someone id never heard of
3426140 but now i realize had i been given the opportunity what i could have been and im about to die
3426141 the people i work with are the new black politics we dont carry around that history we see the world through post civil rights eyes i dont mean that disrespectfully but thats just the way it is
3426142 i dont want in any way to seem critical of the generation of leadership who fought so i could be sitting here
3426143 barack obama is the sum of their struggle hes the sum of their tears their fights their marching their pain this opportunity is the sum of that
3426144 but its like watching something that youve been working on all your life sort of come together right before your eyes and you cant see it
3426145 its like youve been building the great wall of china and you finally put that last stone in and you cant see it you just cant see the enormity of it
3426146 he should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself
3426147 but youve got to learn one basic lesson youre trying to start at the top and you cant start at the top in politics
3426148 i dont think a group with 435 members can be the top of anything
3426149 race was a factor in the contest between obama and clinton
3426150 theres no question race will be a factor with obama and mccain but im not sure it plays out as neatly as people think theres no question that some young cohort of white voters were drawn to obama because they like the idea of a break with the past a young white politician from illinois might not have gotten that support so race probably cost obama some votes and it probably won him some votes thats the complex reality were living in
3426151 you know what its like growing up every single day and having people ask to touch your hair because theyve never seen hair like that
3426152 to have the entire class laugh and giggle when somebody pronounces niger as nigger the constant bombardment of that kind of thing really affects your spirit and its every single day like when people want to come back from a vacation and compare their tan to yours and joke about being black
3426153 i dont want people to expect me to speak about those issues
3426154 i want people to ask me about nonproliferation i want them to run to me to speak about the situation in the middle east
3426155 i dont want to be the person thats turned to when cnn talks about black leaders
3426156 so obamas the first one out there on the ice
3426157 this campaign is giving other african americans like myself the courage to be themselves
3426158 internal polling in both campaigns after iowa showed obama suddenly garnering closer to 75 or 80 percent of the black vote in primary states
3426159 i grew up in the south where men like barack obama who right now is older than bill clinton was when he ran for president were called boy
3426160 there was something about the condescension on his face when he said it and the dismissiveness in his voice
3426161 the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and bitterness of those years at times that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politicians own failings
3426162 in the context of what i do for a living ive not figured out a black or white way to fill a pothole
3426163 i think there was a lot of sensitivity some warranted and some unwarranted
3426164 its based on your life experience and its generational you know if you have a sore on your arm you dont necessarily have to touch the sore to feel the pain you can touch another part of your arm youve still got a certain sensitivity to it so if race is the sensitive thing then anything that even gets close to it sounds like it looks like it feels like it is it
3426165 you guys told me it was a skin condition i thought i was talking to a brother
3426166 look i never asked anybody to be for me because i was black
3426167 i asked people to be for me because i thought i was the best candidate when i ran for city council and when i ran for mayor im proud of the votes i received im proud i received the votes of the majority of the african american community and the majority of the vote from the white community but i never asked anybody to give me anything because i was black i asked people to give me a chance because i thought i was the best
3426168 its presumptuous it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep in contrast to any other group i mean i dont remember seeing
3426169 the challenge there is never forgetting where you came from
3426170 so yes i am mayor of all philadelphia but i am quite well aware of and raise on a regular basis the fact that the majority of people who are killed in philadelphia are african american that the overwhelming majority of people who have health care challenges are african american that education has tremendous disparity gaps unemployment incarceration poverty homelessness housing all affect the african american community at a disproportionate level as opposed to everyone else
3426171 this isnt a struggle that began in the 1930s or 1960s its a struggle that began in 1620 its a struggle against slavery and its children
3426172 one of the things i talk to clients about is that the digital divide has changed
3426173 its no longer along racial lines like it was in 1996 and 2000 now its more economic and educational
3426174 things are changing from where they were 30 years ago the fights are changing and you have an infrastructure thats not producing results look at the incarceration rates the difference between whites and blacks what are the old organizations accomplishing
3426175 there are some members who need to go or to update and be accountable
3426176 its not about getting rid of the n a a c p or our members of congress its just wanting to be proud of our leaders
3426177 shes poised to be one of the most influential people in politics and particularly among african americans in politics
3426178 even as we continue to defend affirmative action as a useful if limited tool to expand opportunity to underrepresented minorities we should consider spending a lot more of our political capital convincing america to make investments needed to ensure that all children perform at grade level and graduate from high school a goal that if met would do more than affirmative action to help those black and latino children who need it the most
3426179 if obama is president it will no longer be tenable to go to the white community and say youve been victimized
3426180 and i understand the poverty and the condition of black america and the 39 percent unemployment rate in some communities i understand that but if you go out to the country and say youve been victimized by the white community while barack obama and michelle and their kids are living in the white house you will be shut off from having any influence
3426181 its a very interesting question but as a black person you should feel confident that he will focus on your injustices and know that all the other injustices in other communities affect you too
3426182 there have been wounds in all the communities not just in the black community there are plenty of wounds to go around
3426183 youre constantly tested by a whole host of factors to see whether youre speaking for the entire commonwealth or just for one community
3426184 i dont fit in any box and i think thats what the electorate has had to learn about me
3426185 yes but its not good enough for me to have the reaction that you just did to say im the governor not the mayor
3426186 you wouldnt believe how many times in the last few days people have stuck microphones in my face to ask my opinion about jesse jacksons comments
3426187 all i have to be is as good a human being and as good a governor as i can be and the rest will take care of itself

3426230 the report s contextual approach to the patent system is a welcome change of perspective that can bring a new dimension of credibility and relevance to wipo by contrast the report does not draw a coherent picture of patent issues in the ict sector wipo should formulate an agenda based on addressing real problems such as the growing conflicts between standards and patents rather than harmonizing prematurely at a time when the system is undergoing change and conflict
3426231 the group also discussed having a parallel system allowing small and medium sized parties to have local disputes heard outside of the eu patent litigation system

3426234 summary the united states patent and trademark office uspto is seeking comments to obtain the views of the public on international efforts to harmonize substantive requirements of patent laws and any potential subsequent changes to united states law and practice
3426235 of course proprietary technology development is vital to reward r amp d investment and innovation that would otherwise not be made the patent system is a tremendously effective mechanism to create incentives to innovate and reward successful innovation
3426236 standards may also emerge de facto from markets a particular operating system for example or a particular document format
3426237 and of course copyrights and trade secrets may not be technologically innovative
3426238 most of us who voted no are ardent supporters of the old eec ec and the eu how could you sell a treaty purporting to give more democratic represntation to the eu citizens and yet refuse to let them have a voice running forward blindly is not progress the no vote was actually a conscious educated rejection of what was determined to be a flawed document the people of europe must have a voice we are not anti change not anti progress and not out to spoil the party heres hoping a no vote will ensure a more democratic and accountable eu

3426245 in a series of cases including in re nuijten in re comiskey and in re bilski the patent and trademark office has argued in favor of imposing new restrictions on the scope of patentable subject matter set forth by congress in 101 of the patent act
3426246 the result was a text that used the language of the contribution theory of article 52 2 to achieve the result of the whole contents theory and thereby give the principles of post 1999 epo case law the imprimatur of european union

3426254 the injury luke suffered is not all that uncommon for golfers and baseball players and im confident he will make a full recovery with the proper rehabilitation and training
3426255 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this injury was especially disappointing for me considering that it forced me to miss the open championship and it comes in a ryder cup year
3426256 but taking proper care of it is my highest priority and im encouraged by dr weilands experience with this type of injury and his outlook towards my recovery and rehabilitation
3426257 i am appreciative of his guidance as well as his staffs and look forward to working diligently at my rehabilitation and returning to action next season
3426258 obviously i would prefer not to have the surgery and that would be better for me in the long term but i can only give myself so much time before i have to take matters further and decide to go for an operation
3426259 surgery can be risky and that is why ive tried to avoid it at all costs
3426260 i have damaged some connective tissue in my left wrist which holds one of the tendons in place you could say that the tendon is dislocating but it is not an actual dislocation
3426261 the good news is that there is nothing wrong with the tendon itself and if i was an ordinary member of the public it wouldnt make too much difference to my life the fact is that 95 of the time my wrist feels normal
3426262 its just that when it flexes in certain positions when i try to swing a club the tendon pops out
3426263 it has all been hugely frustrating and it is particularly annoying that this has happened to me in a ryder cup year
3426264 the cup only comes around every two years so i feel as if im missing out double

3426282 at the end of the day if word of aerial 1080 distribution becomes common talk amongst our clients in north america and europe i think my concession would be worth next to nothing if i dont get any visitors

3426288 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3426289 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3426290 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3426291 its not something that can be fixed with a patch because its an underlying problem in vista itself

3426293 the bib is quickly becoming the online marketing platform that everyone is trying to duplicate
3426294 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3426295 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3426296 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3426304 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3426305 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3426315 a new kind of christian a tale of two friends on a spiritual journey
3426316 faith is more about a way of life than a system of belief where being authentically good is more important than being doctrinally right
3426317 more specifically mclaren rejects absolute truth authority theology objectivity certainty and clarity he embraces relativism inclusivism deconstructionism stories to replace truth creative interpretation of scripture neo orthodoxy and tolerance
3426318 i feel like a fundamentalist whos losing his grip whose fundamentals are cracking and fraying and falling apart and slipping through my fingers its like i thought i was building my house on rock but it turned out to be ice and now global warming his hit and the ice is melting and everything is crumbling
3426319 i dont dislike fundamentalists taken individually they tend to be pretty nice folks get them together in a group though and i get nervous i start to twitch and break out in a rash
3426320 no matter how resplendent with biblical quotations can claim to be the ultimate christian worldview because every model is at the least limited by the limitations of the contemporary human mind not to mention the taste in universes of that particular age
3426321 there are good catholics good greek orthodox good pentecostals and good episcopalians
3426322 i think what jesus was about was a global public movement or revolution to bring holistic reconciliation a reconnection with god with others with ourselves with our environment
3426323 not a look it up encyclopedia of timeless moral truths but the unfolding narrative of god at work
3426324 but it is never sola never the only factor rather scripture is always in dialogue with tradition reason and experience
3426325 i dont think weve got the gospel right yet what does it mean to be saved when i read the bible i dont see it meaning im going to heaven after i die before modern evangelicalism nobody accepted jesus christ as their personal savior or walked down an aisle or said the sinners prayer i dont think the liberals have it right but i dont think we have it right either none of us has arrived at orthodoxy
3426326 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
3426327 one becomes a christian through an event process or both in which one identifies with jesus his mission and his followers
3426328 a strong conviction that the exclusive hell oriented gospel is not the way forward
3426329 conversational never attempting to be the last word and thus silence other voices
3426330 doesnt claim too much it admits it walks with a limp
3426331 to be a christian in a generously orthodox way is not to claim to have the truth captured stuffed and mounted on the wall
3426332 it is a hard to break protestant habit that is hazardous to spiritual health
3426333 not just a message about jesus that focused on the afterlife but rather the core message of jesus that focused on personal social and global transformation in this life
3426334 a way of talking about the challenges of the immediate present
3426335 are no more to be taken literally than phrases we might read in the paper today
3426336 evangelical post protestant liberal conservative mystical poetic biblical charismatic contemplative fundamentalist calvinist anabaptist anglican methodist catholic green incarnational emergent
3426337 but another ancient strand of christianity teaches that we are all caught up in the divine mystery we call god that the spirit is in everyone and that there are depths of interpretation yet to be plumbed at the cathedral grace episcopal cathedral in san francisco we break the bread for those who follow the path of the buddha and walk the way of the hindus
3426338 it used to be that christian institutions and systems of dogma sustained the spiritual life of christians increasingly spirituality itself is what sustains everything else alan jones is a pioneer in reimagining a christian faith that emerges from authentic spirituality his work stimulates and encourages me deeply
3426339 i dont think its our business to prognosticate the eternal destinies of anyone else
3426340 alas lord i am no son of thine but the servant of tash he answered child all the service thou has done to tash i account as service done to me therefore if any man swear by tash and keep his oath for the oaths sake it is by me that he has truly sworn though he know it not and it is i who reward him
3426341 sought to follow the way of christ without identifying himself as a christian
3426342 my knowledge of buddhism is rudimentary but i have to tell you that much of what i understand strikes me as wonderful and insightful and the same can be said of the teachings of muhammad though of course i have my disagreements
3426343 does it make sense for a good being to create creatures who will experience infinite torture infinite time infinite you know never be numbed in their consciousness
3426344 the traditional understanding says that god asks of us something that god is incapable of himself
3426345 one of the huge problems is the traditional understanding of hell because if the cross is in line with jesus teaching then i wont say the only and i certainly wont say even the primary but a primary meaning of the cross is that the kingdom of god doesnt come like the kingdoms of the this world by inflicting violence and coercing people but that the kingdom of god comes through suffering and willing voluntary sacrifice but in an ironic way the doctrine of hell basically says no that thats not really true that in the end god gets his way through coercion and violence and intimidation and domination just like every other kingdom does the cross isnt the center then the cross is almost a distraction and false advertising for god
3426346 oh brian that was just so beautifully said i was tempted to get on my soap box there and you know because as you and i know there are so many illustrations and examples that you could give that show why the traditional view of hell completely falls in the face just antithetical to the cross but the way you put it there i love that its false advertising and here jesus is saying turn the other cheek love your enemy forgive seven times seventy return violence with self sacrificial love but if we believe the traditional view of hell its like well do that for a short amount of time because eventually gods going to get them
3426347 the church has been preoccupied with the question what happens to your soul after you die as if the reason for jesus coming can be summed up in jesus is trying to help get more souls into heaven as opposed to hell after they die i just think a fair reading of the gospels blows that out of the water i dont think that the entire message and life of jesus can be boiled down to that bottom line
3426348 but what weve created is the problem of sin is that i am so angry at my son brett for beating up his younger brother im going to kill him so now the problem weve got to solve is how to keep me from killing my son does that make sense
3426349 and so now it seems to me the entire christian theology has shifted so now the problem is how can we keep me from killing brett
3426350 we have a vision that the real problem is god wants to kill us all
3426351 the traditional understanding says that god asks of us something that god is incapable of himself god asks us to forgive people but god is incapable of forgiving god cant forgive unless he punishes somebody in place of the person he was going to forgive god doesnt say things to you forgive your wife and then go kick the dog to vent your anger god asks you to actually forgive and theres a certain sense that a common understanding of the atonement presents a god who is incapable of forgiving unless he kicks somebody else
3426352 frankly many of us dont know what we should think about homosexuality we arent sure if or where lines are to be drawn nor do we know how to enforce with fairness whatever lines are drawn perhaps we need a five year moratorium on making pronouncements
3426353 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
3426354 there is still a lot to do but the night is long
3426355 we couldnt solve all problems at once we find ourselves in an emergency situation

3426358 this is not the time to make political attacks with russian tanks only a few kilometres from our capital
3426359 there will be time for determining responsibility and guilt later on
3426360 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose georgias duly elected government
3426361 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict
3426362 delta airlines have increased their board bag fees to 300 each way for international flights costing surfers 600 roundtrip to travel with their board this rate has instantaneously tripled from its previous 100 charge its extremely important to note the outstanding difference in fees the cost of checking your board may surpass the amount of your ticket skewing your traveling budget entirely in conjunction with the rising cost of oil airlines have increased the price of tickets and baggage fees with no exception to board bags but where is the justice in tripling the rates of surfboard bags while checking golf bags remain to be free of charge
3426363 its a disease that is spread easily and we have to take steps to protect and vaccinate our kids
3426364 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3426365 talk to the chief information officer at just about any american university and he will probably say that his institution has bent over backward to help the recording industry association of america curb illegal file sharing on his campus he will also tell you hes angry
3426366 we feel like weve been led down the garden path and our interest in working in partnership and leading our mission as educators is now being used against us

3426376 it makes me wonder what is so strategic in that little corner of georgia that makes both the georgians and the russians want to fight over it
3426377 when the 731st landed in japan we were detached from the 452nd and attached to the 3rd bomb group l there were mixed feelings concerning the shift mostly we as reservists were being thrown in with the regulars like so many lambs thrown to the wolves it wasnt long until we discovered that as a whole the officers and airmen of 3rd were a swell bunch little did we now the 3rd is one of the oldest organizations in the air force
3426378 by september four crews had completed a stepped up schedule at george air force base california and flew their planes to japan where they were attached to the 3rd bomb group and started flying combat the day after arrival a short time later the balance of airplanes crews and ground support personnel were transported by air and water
3426379 with their training focused on radar amp shoran they became the night intruders the radar and electronic eyes of the tactical air force this was the only b 26 squadron trained in this fashion they were pulled out of the 452nd and assigned to the 3rd bomb group to bring that group up to strength the 452nd flew daylight missions from pusan korea and the 3rd flew night missions from iwakuni japan
3426380 in late june 1951 the 731st was deactivated on paper and the 90th which was one of the other wwii squadrons with the 3rd was reactivated all the equipment and remaining personnel was then transferred to the 90th by this time the 731st had flown more than 9000 hours of combat and 2000 missions under every conceivable disadvantages bad weather patched up airplanes weary personnel and few replacements they had flown all sorts of missions including high medium and low level bombing visual and radar bombing front line support flare drops armed reconnaissance strafing and rocketry and had the distinction of flying the 10 000 mission for the 3rd bomb group
3426381 when i arrived in may 51 the unit was designated as the 731st sq which had been one of the four squadrons of the 452nd wing a reserve wing based at long beach ca when the war broke out many of the ground crew members had been employed by the douglas aircraft company the manufacturers of the a b 26 they provided excellent maintenance and other support which we the aircrews thought was a tad better than that provided to the 8th and 13 squadrons
3426382 each side could reconsider the views presented by the other side
3426383 simply trying to gain by negotiations what they have not been able to gain by conquest we intend to find that out
3426384 july 30 in the largest single mass attack for the month on targets in the pyongyang area ninety one f 80s suppressed enemy air defenses while 354 usmc and usaf fighter bombers attacked specified military targets to avoid adverse world public opinion during on going peace negotiations the joint chiefs of staff withheld information on the strike from the news media
3426385 on july 30 the far east air force carries out a bombing raid on pyongyang gen matthew b ridgway united nations supreme commander has convinced the political leadership and the joint chiefs of staff that it is necessary to keep military pressure on the communists to keep them at the bargaining table the raid is directed against military targets in the north korean capital bad weather prevents medium bomber participation in the attack but air force fighter and fighter bomber crews fly 450 sorties damage assessments cannot be made because of weather and dense smoke
3426386 i think you might be interested in the day light formation mission to pyongyang
3426387 the 90th put up 36 a c in two groups of 18 each i was the wing lead navigator lt col moyer was the lead pilot and col nils ohman was the mission commander col ohman also acted as copilot for col moyer i hate to admit it but i cant remember who the shoran operator was
3426388 as i recall col ohman was being groomed for a b g star in sac and was temporarily with the 3rd bomb wing to get some recent combat experience
3426389 the briefing was normal until the briefing people put the route overlay up
3426390 i dont believe a single crew had flown formation since wwii
3426391 ok navigator wheres all that flak you were talking about
3426392 check your watch col it will hit us in 12 seconds
3426393 my navigator is dead and im hit i will try to make it to seoul
3426394 when we got back to iwakuni col ohman called 5th air force to find out what happened he got absolutely no satisfaction after we got out of the flak i called the second group of 18 a c and gave them a different heading to avoid these particular guns the second group was never even fired at
3426395 the pilot who said he wanted to rejoin the formation after saying that he was hit and his navigator was dead was the last one to come back to iwakuni
3426396 i believe that the 3rd bomb wing did a fabulous job and the entire wing should be commended
3426397 as a follow up history for the july 1951 raid on pyongyang the 3rd bomb wing carried a mixture of fire bombs and 500 pounders with delayed action fuses the fuses were set randomly from 30 minutes to 72 hours this was to keep the fires spread around and to discourage the fire fighters i remember flying over pyongyang 6 or 8 weeks later and the entire city was just one big vegetable garden as i recall there also were a couple of b 29 formations involved as well as some raaf fighter sweeps i am pretty sure that it added up to over a thousand planes many of which flew more than one sortie
3426398 when we deployed from iwakuni to kunsan in late august 1951 most of the original ground crew members were still with us although most of the original aircrews had returned to usa jima if you have access to the combat loss stats by squadron i think youll find that there were significantly fewer losses in the 731st 90th sq than the 8th and 13th much of the difference is attributable to the fact that the aircrews were somewhat older mid to late 20s than those of the other two squadrons but the the ground crews deserve some of the credit
3426399 about aug 51 we left iwakuni flew a mission amp landed at k 8 my first time our parking area 90th was on the far side of the runway on the old japanese runway grass mud dark
3426400 oh yes i remember the wave and our crews trying to fix it
3426401 when it the runway was finished it had to dug up and refilled as i remember a truck went over it and it did the wave way thing and the capt waters commander c co 809th said dig it up and add more fill
3426402 at this point i dont see any reason why someone should not buy things from agriprocessors
3426403 they run a very impressive operation theyre very dedicated to making sure that everything is being done in the most appropriate way possible

3426421 we never made any donations sir i have no idea what you are talking about
3426422 the question of how you handle mps remuneration can be quite controversial
3426423 we decided since quiescence had arrived in that area it was probably not good for us to reopen it
3426424 there is an unmistakeable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3426425 as for the long term prognosis there are plenty of people talking about a 10 per cent decline in values but based on todays figures a decline of that magnitude is not evident yet
3426426 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought
3426427 however i dont think it is as bad as the picture the media has painted the only thing i consider grim is that the sales volumes are down
3426428 it is clear from the way new zealanders consume alcohol and the harms that result that we need to make real and enduring changes
3426429 it is expected that consideration of alcohol limits and possible solutions will be a key part
3426430 you have no idea what an honor this is is the rest of your team with you by any chance dr mckay that lovely young boy ronon
3426431 arent you you know going to demand that i kneel before you and all that sort of thing
3426432 it might make for a nice change if you knelt before me instead
3426433 i cant tell you what a great fan i am of yours colonel sheppard
3426434 a huge fan your adventures are so many and so varied
3426435 though i do not understand how there can be so many or that they can take place in seeming contradiction to each other or that you can have so many partners and yet still be in love with only one person at a time to be honest i think i prefer you with dr mckay although the times they have you paired with a third person as well
3426436 after all the wraith come off looking rather badly in these stories but dont your people have a saying where theres smoke theres fire
3426437 couldnt you i dont know persuade the writers to portray the wraith a little more fairly
3426438 and i would dearly love an explanation as to how so many timelines and mission outcomes can be so widely accepted i mean the variations on trinity alone
3426439 you know i really dont have any influence on the writers here
3426440 of course you do you have proven so deliciously defiant in all of our dealings with you im certain that you are just as stubborn and recalcitrant in these stories in fact i am certain that if someone tries to write you in a way that is contrary to your nature you simply refuse to go
3426441 if you could just give us a little expression of defiance maybe oh well okay confusion works nicely too
3426442 and now one of the two of us together oh thank you you are so kind
3426443 i was wondering if dr mckay could help me get a live journal account
3426444 oh for chrissakes not another nightmare let me guess the clowns again right
3426445 if youre going to keep this up colonel you can just go back to your own room some of us need to get more than two and half hours of shut eye every evening
3426446 friends dont let friends eat ronons chili i dont know what you were thinking its not like you have the gastrointestinal tract of an eighteen year old any more
3426447 i know what im getting you for your next birthday maalox depends a knee replacement

3426469 this is a digitally manufactured shot to represent whats happening right now outside the stadium
3426470 the audience makeup of the olympics is very much like that of american idol and dancing with the stars which have live season finales presented in much the same way
