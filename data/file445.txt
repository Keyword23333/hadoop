4450001 when you suffer a major injury there is an ongoing struggle to maintain your confidence in your ability to live a normal life
4450002 it takes dedication to get up every day get the kids off to school and come to work
4450003 but rancho has taught me that sometimes the things we take for granted are really the sweetest things in life
4450004 we at rancho try to make sure we provide quality care to patients and their families help them transition back into the community we help them find resources housing fiscal resources caregivers we also provide and this is important psychological support or counseling because most of our patients have had a traumatic event and this affects the whole family oftentimes they experience depression anger you name it
4450005 we serve a very diverse population and we see all ethnicities
4450006 most of them come from less favored environments and finding resources could be a big challenge nevertheless we serve everybody who are residents of la county whether they have insurance or not everybody gets excellent care
4450007 both areas stress the importance of focusing on your strengths learning to maximize your potential freeing your mind of your limitations there are very helpful suggestions on deep breathing exercises on visualization on focusing your energy on self actualization on having a positive attitude its good stuff
4450008 and ive worked very hard to maximize my potential to be independent lead as normal a life as anybody else be as comfortable with my disability as i can i have succeeded to a large degree i think my three kids and my wife are very comfortable with me in my wheelchair and so on this sense of confidence of self worth i try to convey to my patients and they listen because ive overcome what theyre going through
4450009 as an institution our biggest challenge right now as you may know is to stay open
4450010 march 2009 is a red letter day for us thats when the class action suit against ranchos closing is up all indications though are that we will stay open weve been working very hard doing things more efficiently and more effectively so they wont fault us on our operations in this respect supervisor don knabe whom we consider one of the champions of rancho may be our greatest supporter on this as busy as he is he comes and supports us with his time and participates in our programs
4450011 we cannot forget the valuable contributions made by rancho volunteers and the work the amigos fund does is tremendous
4450012 theyre the ones who raise money to help the patients who wont have any otherwise

4450020 preparandoci per questo blog abbiamo visto molte discussioni nella blogosfera riguardo quello che microsoft potrebbe star tentando si ottenere conservando un controllo lievemente maggiore sulla comunicazione riguardo windows 7 alcuni potrebbero vederlo come un eufemismo
4450021 their work was absolutely vital and it is right that we thank them now for their dedication in the service of their country
4450022 we had just 10 minutes walk to go to the recruiting office but we had no idea what we wanted to do
4450023 the girl picked up this letter and said oh we got this letter here this morning she read the letter out and it said that women were urgently required by the ministry of supply for timber measurers i think it was that word urgently that did it and we volunteered there and then
4450024 everything was a bit mysterious to us although the war was on we werent involved really apart from going in and joining up
4450025 a lot of these were just taken over by the government the people who had the estates had no option
4450026 there was one estate out of town and it was an elderly man who owned it and he was in tears he was just broken hearted to think that his whole estate had to go
4450027 the summer was fun the winter wasnt so good but we felt that we were doing something anyway it wasnt really hard work physically we had gadgets for measuring the heights of the trees but then you had to work out the volume which wasnt always easy we knew that somehow or other we had to get to the end of the day whether it was good or bad
4450028 we went to a place near fort william and the man who told us where to go said we had to stay there but wed better clear the place of the rats first he thought that was pretty funny
4450029 the only thing we had to keep them away was smoking cigarettes they just used to come in shoals
4450030 and the boat we had to go on if the wind got up it was a terrible thing but we never thought of the danger we just got on with it and hoped it would be all right
4450031 there was a time when our boss told us where to go
4450032 we knew there was ammunition being fired but we didnt pay it much attention until one girl out of the three of us said this is live ammunition i phoned my boss and he came out to see for himself and said you cant stay here we were out of there pretty quick after that
4450033 you could see the commandos sometimes if we were out on our job theyd never say where they were going just that they were going to do some training
4450034 we thought we were far away from everybody we didnt come into contact much with people out where we were working we had no social life i can tell you no one was available to go to a dance
4450035 there was one occasion where we met with some ats auxiliary territorial service the womens branch of the army during world war ii they had two caravans near this loch and they were billeted there we had a wee party with them and that was the only party i remember
4450036 i was at a forestry office near dingwall when the word came through that the war was over it would have been over for a while by the time i heard i bet
4450037 i cant remember a party i never even got into inverness and it was all more or less quite quiet we still did the same work
4450038 if i know for certain a thing is right i could keep it going against any people who were against me

4450043 die huffpost zahlt nichts genauso wie die anderen umst rzler youtube oder facebook die unmengen von information von ihren usern geschenkt bekommen und daraus eine werbeplattform zimmern der normale verleger entlohnt seine autoren redakteure und korrektoren
4450044 die huffington post kommt mit einer mini truppe von 50 leuten aus die new york times hat an die 1000 redakteure

4450080 he was the only man from whom you could get a straight vodka at three in the afternoon in an office that was big enough to land a plane in

4450089 while guidance in fq3 was below expectations we believe management has set achievable goals for the back half with low inventory levels that will help protect gross margins
4450090 despite solid inventory management jwn continues to fall victim to an increasingly promotional luxury department store environment with gpm falling handily
4450091 we commend jwn on its more realistic outlook for 2h but remain uninvolved as it undergoes an accelerated store expansion plan 10 new units next 4 quarters vs 5 in trailing 4 periods that continues to pick up steam well into 2010
4450092 is there any truth in this myth not a jot lets be clear a fact like this would require a lot of scientific research to substantiate and such research is not something you can just make up it is painstaking and usually very specific and there is no research no papers and no investigation that comes close to confirming that you only use 10 of the brain

4450100 the whole point of these campaign contributions is to buy influence
4450101 boulder liberal udall and his environmental extremist allies want to kill domestic energy
4450102 so of course entities that are in the business of developing oil resources are going to support someone like bob schaffer who doesnt put his head in the sand
4450103 the oil companies know that bob schaffer is a one trick pony that will always put their interests ahead of coloradans
4450104 are designated for candidates who favor the strengthening of the free enterprise system and hold views consistent with the best interests of exxon mobil corp
4450105 mark udall has been a real champion on environmental issues
4450106 pretty much voted against the environment anytime anything came up when he was a member of congress
4450107 paris hilton is more consistent on energy than you are
4450108 to suggest that times havent changed and that we all need to look at a different way of proceeding is twisting the record
4450109 they are trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the titanic have you seen the photographs of the arctic ice cap in five years it will be gone for the first time in 16 million years
4450110 weve got this addiction to oil and the addiction is going to kill us
4450111 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4450112 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
4450113 keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea
4450114 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4450115 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
4450116 whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved
4450117 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
4450118 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4450119 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
4450120 where planned obsolescence leaves off psychological obsolescence takes over we are made to feel ashamed to wear clothes or drive cars until they are worn out the mass media have convinced us that to be out of step with fashion is to be out of step with reality it is time we awaken to the fact that conformity to a sick society is to be sick
4450121 looking ahead to the conventions we had finally hit on the formula that integrated msnbc and nbc news the guy we were going to lean on was tim russert i think wed be best advised to take that time we were going to give to tim and just be silent in his memory i dont know what were going to do without him i mean that in the philosophical way but also practically speaking
4450122 we used to consider ourselves gavel to gavel that doesnt make sense any more for lots of reasons were not cspan they perform a public service but we provide more than that

4450133 we are still working on systems and personnel and what will enable us to sustain a level of performance right from the start to the end of a premier league season
4450134 while we are looking to improve the squad if we can we already have good players here
4450135 unfortunately they did not perform in the way we needed last night but we will see an improvement at the weekend
4450136 we are not there yet with our match fitness but this game will help us going into the weekend it was a good test for us
4450137 we need to step up to the plate and become more dynamic it is important we show a bit more quality on the ball with the right pass at the right time
4450138 we are looking forward to villa and i am expecting a significantly improved performance
4450139 it is only half time and we will have more games under our belt in the second leg no difference from last season we have needed a decent midfield for 3 years now

4450141 these exciting preliminary results come from using them to harness the bodys own immune response in a new way although the side effects need to be monitored carefully we hope that this type of treatment will prove to be active in larger trials in the future
4450142 it remains to be seen if most of the responses are longlasting certainly the results are very promising
4450143 two of the seven had a complete response and five a partial regression greater than 50 per cent reduction of tumour
4450144 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that those operations will halt
4450145 we dont want any cease fire document to become the legitimization for russian occupation of georgian territories
4450146 we will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis
4450147 it is long overdue too many innocent people have died and georgia whose territorial integrity and independence and sovereignty we fully respect must be able to get back to normal life
4450148 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4450149 everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we as we look ahead
4450150 and i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build and build their economies
4450151 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that those operations will halt

4450158 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4450159 the united states would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests were not protected
4450160 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4450161 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4450162 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4450163 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4450164 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4450165 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4450166 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4450167 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4450168 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4450169 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4450170 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4450171 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4450172 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4450173 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4450174 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4450175 so if you want to see what facebook looked like about three years ago you can go there at the time it literally was just facebook copied in red
4450176 now that facebook despite trying hard has not been successful in the german market the company seeks to obstruct studivz through court action their strategy appears to be if you cant beat them sue them
4450177 the first difficulty they run into is studivz is in germany
4450178 so facebook has sued them here on the theory that by logging in to the facebook site they agreed to be subject to suit in california
4450179 because it lets the person who executes the idea best win in the marketplace and that protects a healthy competitive marketplace
4450180 it may look like an easy thing to do but actually growing such a copycat is just as hard as building a company thats otherwise your own original idea
4450181 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that those operations will halt

4450187 and i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build and build their economies
4450188 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4450189 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4450190 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4450191 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4450192 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4450193 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4450194 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4450195 theyre political people and i do not hold it against them
4450196 i cant justify what they did allegedly and im not happy about it
4450197 staff members were told to destroy nothing save everything and cooperate
4450198 honey i cant mow the lawn rake the leaves clean the gutters today as im committed to doing my part to find a cure for lou gehrigs disease
4450199 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal
4450200 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4450201 any implication otherwise is an absolute lie balthazars affair has been utterly devastating to rosetta and her family
4450202 yes theyre living separate lives at the moment because of his shenanigans
4450203 its disappointing that getty and miller are flaunting this so publicly there are four children involved their oldest cassius is mature enough to understand somethings not right

4450206 ive worked hard to develop as a defender in the championship with cardiff but celtic offer me the stage of champions league football and that was a very important factor in my decision
4450207 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4450208 well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap
4450209 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4450210 of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia

4450215 se bastasse la firma dei patti per far calare i reati sarebbe troppo semplice in realt il calo dovuto a diversi fattori tra i quali la fine delleffetto dovuto allindulto e certamente anche per una pi efficace azione delle forze dellordine ma ancora presto per fare i bilanci li faremo a fine anno

4450247 it is just by coincidence that i made the oath today god gave me the strength to do it
4450248 by swearing in gods homes that i was sodomised by my employer i challenge anwar ibrahim to swear and to do it in a mosque to deny my allegations
4450249 i would like to emphasise that it happened by force without my permission
4450250 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
4450251 i think the voter sentiment is they really want to prod alan carpenter to get his act together and create a decent government but they have no confidence in the ability of the liberals to be able to do that either and i think the figures could move quite materially
4450252 i think if people see these figures and really believe that the liberals could win they could move back to labor at this stage i think theres a real sentiment out there that alan carpenter and labor need to be taught a lesson
4450253 to beat the french by half a second made it exciting
4450254 it took every inch of effort to beat them as they have been invincible we had to put the pieces of the jigsaw together
4450255 historically what mcdonalds would have seen are weak transactions against fuel price increases and interest rate hikes and we havent seen that this time around
4450256 we think its an absolutely appropriate response to consumer needs at the moment
4450257 whilst were facing headwinds at the moment at this point in time those headwinds are manageable and were trying very very hard not to increase our cost to service across the counter
4450258 there has been a great deal of long liquidation in the oil complex as investors have kicked out long oil holdings
4450259 these were established on the belief that the dollar would keep on declining so the dollars recent strength has forced them out
4450260 investors are rebalancing their portfolios in favor of the dollar amid prospects that interest rates in eurozone have peaked and that the ecb will have to start its monetary easing cycle to tackle a rapid slowdown in european economies
4450261 overall oil has joined a broad commodity sell off on fears of a global economic slowdown
4450262 while still a dangerous transitional period the fact that diplomacy will now replace military action bodes well
4450263 a tropical depression could form at any time during the next day or so as the system continues westward or west northwestward near puerto rico and hispaniola
4450264 while the weather could prompt some short position holders to close out ahead of the weekend the system was unlikely to make its way into the key oil producing gulf of mexico
4450265 the tropical low in the atlantic basin is still under watch but all computer models are showing it deviating towards the u s east coast rather than the u s gulf
4450266 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4450267 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4450268 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4450269 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4450270 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4450271 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4450272 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4450273 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4450274 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4450275 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4450276 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4450277 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4450278 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4450294 this is a great acknowledgement of corporate visions thought leadership in the area of marketing and sales alignment and a credit to dianes experience and expertise
4450295 were proud to be identified and selected by the ama as their partner for developing and bringing this strategic hot topic to the marketplace
4450296 more companies are realizing that their two most expensive resources marketing and sales departments need to be working better together to make sure they are having the greatest business impact
4450297 the ability of these two groups to align all their efforts and energies is the next big breakthrough for companies looking to be different and stand out in highly competitive markets
4450298 better black television has been a vision of mine for some years
4450299 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years promoting positive content and positive messages is so important to educate and preserve the next generation being exposed to positive content is what changed my life i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming in addition im excited to be able to expose the urban community to a vast array of jobs in the entertainment community that they might not otherwise be privy to i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and my son and i will continue to do work with them and support their networks with bbtv were spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family friendly hip hop content
4450300 were extremely proud of our programming that will be airing on bbtv
4450301 its extremely important to feed clean quality and positive subject matter to our families

4450345 today we wake up and see that most of this area is taped off again and we see people in full white suits walking around just a few feet away from us
4450346 they need a white suit but we dont whats going to happen long term here if we stay here are we going to get sick 10 15 20 years from now no ones giving us those answers
4450347 i have a house with broken windows i have every reason to believe that is full of asbestos and i challenge any one of you to tell me otherwise
4450348 and i have lungs every reason to believe full of asbestos and given myself and my neighbors were running from the streets and running from the goddamn lies and i challenge any one of you to tell me i wont get cancer in the next 15 or 25 years and just a coincidence the nerve of you people to act so goddamn smug you screwed up big time
4450349 if it were my child i would not be worried
4450350 i would not be worried because we know that the level of exposure would be exceedingly low its not of concern
4450351 the monitoring done so far simply shows that there is no airborne asbestos now and in fact no airborne asbestos even when personal samples were performed on a worker actively cleaning up this residue or debris
4450352 if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use a death of a firefighter or anything associated with the disaster to deal with it
4450353 i havent slept for two and a half days and ive been traveling to try to get back here okay
4450354 absolutely absolutely but at this point its too soon to say
4450355 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4450356 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4450357 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4450358 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4450359 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4450360 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4450361 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4450362 this report clearly shows there are alternatives to closing the emergency unit which can retain vital services locally without compromising on patient safety

4450366 whos ernest borgnine are you crazy hes a really famous movie star everyone knows who he is
4450367 im living the dream by going green with my baseball cap
4450368 the picture is completely absolutely 100 on schedule on time there were no delays
4450369 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4450370 we would never do anything to hurt one of the movies or the series we love our fans
4450371 mugabe was not lawfully elected and so he cannot take his seat at the sadc table it shouldnt require legal action for sadc to recognise this
4450372 we want relief mugabe must not be recognised as the lawful head of state
4450373 zimbabwe law says that if run off elections are not held within 21 days then the zimbabwean electoral commission must declare the legal winner in this case morgan tsvangirai as president
4450374 it makes clear that any refusal by an incumbent government to relinquish power belongs in the same category of coups detat
4450375 sadc has repeatedly said it will not recognise unconstitutional changes in government and we intend holding them to this commitment
4450376 hes the leading evangelical figure hes trying to craft a new direction a new image for evangelicals the fact that this is happening at saddleback not focus on the family makes it more neutral ground its an audience that both obama and mccain have a real shot at getting
4450377 take up the causes that are politically correct and dont want to take up issues that are controversial
4450378 we thank god for his emphasis but its interesting that the candidates are going to a voice that has been somewhat silent on the great foundational issues of abortion and marriage even though he would stand for those
4450379 we are in danger of losing this whole country to the secularism of europe
4450380 i dont see any conflict at all and if there was i wouldnt be a part of it
4450381 im focused on the same thing rick warren is focused on i think evangelicals must be talking about disease and poverty
4450382 i believe that pastor rick is going to ask a wide range of questions and i believe he will ask questions about issues of life efforts to redefine marriage the importance of family and other issues that are of concern to traditional evangelicals
4450383 i dont know how hard he will press its sort of a new role for him
4450384 using his influence to become the next jerry falwell or james dobson
4450385 if you dont just focus on those two issues if you say there are a variety of issues that ought to be of concern to evangelicals you can plausibly see evangelicals saying obama is better on the first three mccain is better on the last two
4450386 mccain and the republicans need to have evangelicals vote mostly on social issues
4450387 if they do that theyll vote mccain obama is a very strong candidate to appeal to moderate evangelicals he talks about his faith in a compelling way and appeals to them on poverty the environment and the desire for change
4450388 counter my convictions and the convictions of masses of believing americans
4450389 i think the church is in danger of a deception of being courted by senator obama
4450390 but there really is no need to worry about her she is feeling fine and doing well
4450391 she has worked extremely hard towards these justifiably fantastic results
4450392 theres some confusion and we havent decided that yet but the point of it is that weve been negotiating for months and its time to put up the product of those negotiations and if they fail republicans can come up with their stuff
4450393 whatever they want to bring to the floor so that we can vote no to taxes and move these negotiations forward so we can get done is fine with me
4450394 i hope that will engage us in the process and help democrats and the governor realize that were not going to support a tax increase
4450395 believes what the democrats put on the floor should have bipartisan support hell continue to push for that compromise until we get a budget
4450396 it is critical that we take action before monday because the democrats have taken budget reform very seriously
4450397 what do we care about going to the ballot for a phony rainy day fund its nothing republicans would vote on

4450529 the companys gross margin in the second quarter was affected by the tremendous increase in commodity prices increases in container shipping prices from china and the devaluation of the us dollar versus the chinese rmb this trend now seems to be reversing itself as commodity prices have dropped from their highs in may june by an average of 20 the us dollar is showing strength and stabilizing against the chinese currency the price of oil has dropped significantly and we are hopeful that shipping expenses will stabilize or be reduced
4450530 sales for the first six months came in about where we expected we were disappointed in the decrease in gross margins in the second quarter but that situation seems to be at a minimum stabilizing the company continues to be successful at introducing new products as evidenced by its new fireplace accessory line that will begin shipping to wal mart in the third quarter and by the addition of household cleaning items although these items do not have the gross margins of our gun cleaning items they offer an opportunity for tremendous growth at reasonable and profitable gross margins
4450531 the company still projects sales in the third and fourth quarters combined to be between 11 000 000 and 13 000 000 a big contributing factor being the shipment of our fireplace accessories the company has also received a commitment of almost 1 000 000 on a holiday promotion with wal mart we expect annual sales for 2008 of between 16 000 000 and 18 000 000 and net profits between eleven and thirteen cents per share the company continues to tightly control expenses and improve its strong financial condition as evidenced by current assets of 5 62 million and current liabilities of only 1 55 million a current ration of 3 6 to 1 and shareholder equity of 4 757 145 the company will continue to develop new products and in fact has been asked to work on a significant amount of new household cleaning items for 2008

4450553 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4450564 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4450565 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4450566 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4450616 i think the voter sentiment is they really want to prod alan carpenter to get his act together and create a decent government but they have no confidence in the ability of the liberals to be able to do that either and i think the figures could move quite materially
4450617 i think if people see these figures and really believe that the liberals could win they could move back to labor at this stage i think theres a real sentiment out there that alan carpenter and labor need to be taught a lesson
4450618 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

4450700 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
4450701 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
4450702 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4450703 100 billion dollars is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion dollars in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
4450704 i think advocates of unaccountable privatisation are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatisation of war making on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances of contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
4450705 they outright said if you vote for barack obama this law is going to pass your wages would go down you could lose your job
4450706 our policies are clear and we have communicated to our associates that if anyone representing our company gave the impression they were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and were acting without approval
4450707 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4450708 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4450709 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4450710 im concerned with the way the attorney general frames the problem
4450711 he talks about arbitrary or irrelevant differences between criminal and national security investigations but these were corrections originally designed to prevent the type of overreach the fbi engaged in for years
4450712 nobodys complaining about the fbi collecting domestic intelligence when its appropriate and authorized under the law
4450713 what the attorney general is doing is expanding the bureaus intelligence collection without addressing the mismanagement within the fbi if you have an agency collecting more with less oversight its only going to get worse

4450732 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4450733 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4450734 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4450735 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4450736 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4450737 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today

4450745 i always felt that united would do it last year but i fancy chelsea this time
4450746 theres no african cup of nations in january theyve got a new manager theyve bought one or two players and for all the ups and downs last year they still nearly nicked it
4450747 if united get a top striker in then theyve got a chance
4450748 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4450749 we will have to wait and see what happens we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4450750 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4450751 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance
4450752 maybe the stories of the financial crisis flying around are not as substantiated as they should be
4450753 i was a little bit scared of city but when we saw them we knew we were their equals we were strong and quick it was only in the last 25 minutes we were under any kind of pressure
4450754 the players will be allowed to celebrate a little because very soon they will be back at work
4450755 we needed a spark to help us unlock the door but we did not have that
4450756 however when the second leg comes round we will have more games under our belt
4450757 hopefully we will make a better fist of it than we did here
4450758 i think we are close to doing something with robbie

4450762 the blake prize embraces diversity in its entries and it is important to us that we remain open to the many styles through which artists engage with the subject area
4450763 even if it means giving prizes to work of no artistic merit we have to include at least one and maybe more works mocking christianity every year to prove our transgressive credentials
4450764 how can he be so offended its just a jew on the cross

4450776 ive been working on my defensive skills with new coach jorge rubio and it looks like prescott will be testing out what ive been learning in the gym
4450777 along with my strength and conditioning coach im also punching harder than ever before and i think my offensive skills are going to win me this fight

4450821 the unique part of this mission was the incorporation of a maintenance task force from an operational missile wing
4450822 for me the unique part of this launch was seeing all the moving pieces coming together
4450823 we had maintenance and operations teams from up north working together with us in the squadron the coordination we did with the 30th space wing who manages the range as well as the army and the navy who supported the mission downrange

4450868 over the past week american media have achieved one thing for sure they have lost prestige among a generation of young russians who believed that america is a country of true uncorrupted independent information many russian youths come to the united states for college and then go back to russia to help build our own democracy russians believe in democracy but i dont know whether many russians will ever trust american media reports again u s newspapers have lost esteem among russian journalists as well these reporters have long looked to american newspapers as icons of quality journalism they are supposed to stand for truth and serve the peoples interests but whose interests did newspapers serve by publishing stories in the best traditions of the cold war
4450869 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it
4450870 but we have learnt since that the west has its own propaganda and in some ways it is more powerful because people believe it
4450871 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
4450872 we have no reason to believe it was nobody knows what was in this gentlemans mind

4450886 isnt that the truth you can ask the same question three different ways and get three different answers i understand that

4450895 photoaging which is the damage to skin caused by sunlight accounts for approximately 80 percent of wrinkles
4450896 thats why monks who live their lives in dark monasteries have skin like a teenager when theyre 80
4450897 a topical product with the right ingredients can make a significant difference in the early stages of aging
4450898 the skin around the eyes is the thinnest on the body
4450899 there isnt as much collagen and elastin there to begin with which means once you start acquiring some sun damage its one of the first areas on the face to wrinkle
4450900 the better antioxidants can also make skin less sensitive to the sun
4450901 they cause inflammation around the sinuses and dilated blood vessels under the eyes
4450902 directly beneath the surface of the thin undereye skin youve got a multitude of tiny veins stacked on top of one another in crisscrossing directions its this confluence of color right beneath the skin that can give it the darkish hue
4450903 the reason you see lines here early on is because the skin is exposed and its a delicate area
4450904 even if you diligently apply sunscreen to your face it often gets rubbed off right near the mouth when you use a napkin or lick your lips
4450905 by regularly getting rid of the dead skin here you reduce the appearance of lines
4450906 after one laser treatment i get so many compliments on my beautiful radiant skin
4450907 your skins outer layers make or break your glow factor if yours are dry they wont allow light in
4450908 chronic stress can produce hormones that damage the skin robbing it of many of the nutrients it needs to look healthy and dullness can be the result
4450909 before the peels i relied on thick concealers to hide my marks but now i dont even use foundation
4450910 my skin flaked for a few days but about one week later the peeling stopped my marks were gone after the second treatment
4450911 if you lighten four or five of your darkest spots you can look 10 years younger
4450912 because it doesnt distinguish between your normal tone and a splotch it will leave skin with bleached areas if used across your face
4450913 my lines have practically vanished and my skin looks smoother the cost of my treatments was worth it
4450914 i loved that i could go right back to work
4450915 theyre not going to erase deep wrinkles but they can make shallow lines look better after three months
4450916 weve got to affect nedco and the only thing they understand is dollars and cents
4450917 would it make more sense to make room by coordinating with our district judges and whoever puts people in jail for them to quit putting people there to make space
4450918 if there is room for them whoever puts them in jail will put them in jail just because there is room for them
4450919 i dont believe i can house additional inmates without that pod

4450967 in the closer role you have to be able to do certain things he is not able to do certain things yet so all youre doing by anointing him is putting him in a position to fail
4450968 there is a good reason why kissinger and the bush family appeared so relaxed at the beijing olympic games
4450969 there is good quality evidence that drinking excessive amounts of alcohol during pregnancy can damage foetal development
4450970 however the minimum or threshold level at which alcohol begins to pose a significant threat to pregnancy is not known
4450971 many women believe one or two drinks occasionally couldnt possibly hurt the unborn baby but in fact there is no known safe level which is why we advise women to avoid all alcohol
4450972 we dont actually know what the safe level is and every women would seem to metabolise it alcohol quite differently so its best to go with none is our advice to women
4450973 were much stronger than ranzcog and always have been in relation to alcohol in pregnancy
4450974 my personal view is its easier to say dont drink at all than to say minimise it
4450975 if you drink a glass of wine a day you might cut down to a mouthful but if you have a bottle of gin a day you might do a quarter of a bottle instead
4450976 es ist etwas sch nes dabei zu sein ich versuche gas zu geben und zu zeigen was ich drauf habe

4450981 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money
4450982 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however
4450983 do we have enough money probably not are our plans thought out enough nope luckily the excitement of seeing places like new york are throwing any doubts right out the window
4450984 one thing that has helped ease my over active mind is that weve began to book hostels in every city for our arrival nights therefore helping to guarantee that we wont be sleeping on the streets
4450985 given that michael page is a people business you cant make a hostile bid and expect to create value
4450986 you dont have to be loud son to be heavy as shit
4450987 my goal was to capture the energy and emotion of the nightwatchman live shows there is a much more rocking quality to this record solos and riffs mixed with darker acoustic songs i think my singing has come a long way as well i had a lot of devastating losses of family and friends during the past two years and the fabled city is a search for hope through music and confronting injustice
4450988 thats been a theme through a lot of our music
4450989 it might be raining today but it might be sunny tomorrow so its worth sticking around for
4450990 we live in the american idol age the age of instant celebrity
4450991 but we grew up listening to bands that did the same thing we eventually did that was all we knew go out and start playing
4450992 we can stand up with our heads held high because we have a history and weve gone out there for eight years and worked really hard everything that weve done so far weve built ourselves i think theres something to be said for that being able to have our story and being able to have a history as a band
4450993 that really sounds like what were doing every night out on the road without being a live album
4450994 its a college town of course but its also got a big art school and it was just a cool place to vibe musically theres plenty of bars to play at people really love music around there so its very conducive to making music
4450995 we got all the really good arguments out of the way the first couple of years
4450996 it also helped that we knew each other before we were a band we really were friends we figured if we could keep our friendship together we could keep the band together after a couple of years we really found our identity and all those other little things started to seem like really little things because they are little things
4450997 mike wrucke can play any instrument that you put in front of him and he can play it well so as a producer he knows three ways he wants something
4450998 he wants for you as an artist to play the song the way youre gonna play it but hes also got an idea in his head of what hed like to come out of your instrument in that regard he was definitely more hands on without being hands on than any producer that weve worked with before
4450999 we were young and 18 and just trying to make music
4451000 about six songs in it dawned on me that a good portion of what i was writing was sounding like pretty classic toadies
4451001 i called up mark reznicek the toadies drummer and guitarist clark vogeler and just asked them if theyd be interested in doing a record and some touring just to see what would happen
4451002 id like to think that you live and learn when we formed the burden brothers we decided that an independent was the way to go and its been really great but looking back at the interscope deal i have to say that they may have turned down a record but they didnt drop us so we actually didnt get hit as bad as some people
4451003 clark is a big fan of the game always has been
4451004 hes out in la and asked around and found the guy that was the head of the company he asked him hey how come you havent put the toadies on one of these things he said that theyd been dealing with interscope but that the label hadnt returned his calls on us somehow we managed to sneak it by them and its introducing the band to a whole new generation of fans

4451010 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it
4451011 i think the whole of formula 1 is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there
4451012 we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit
4451013 with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful
4451014 we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle
4451015 its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
4451016 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia said the brazilian
4451017 despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels
4451018 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up
4451019 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team setanta readers comment of the day

4451021 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared towards qualifying but i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it to the requisite 14 and a half points
4451022 hopefully the crowds will inspire me to a great week it will be a really strong tournament with so many european players in the field battling to improve their positions on the european ryder cup rankings in the final qualifying event

4451026 it makes a big difference to how you play when your team is winning
4451027 then as a player you think less about it you have that mentality that you are going to win every time you walk out
4451028 so you can go out and express yourself you can do what you want because you feel collectively as a team youre going to win

4451032 every year hes come back to us hes come back a better player there are too many players in county cricket when they cant play for england any more theyre just happy to cruise through whereas van jaarsveld every year makes a little change here and there and becomes a better player and its a credit to him

4451038 well probably see investment banks capital levels move closer to commercial banks i dont know where exactly theyll end up and until housing and credit markets stabilize we wont know

4451187 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4451188 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4451189 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4451190 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4451191 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4451192 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4451193 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4451194 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4451195 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4451219 weve had a fair amount of activity but weve been fortunate with the weather and weve been real fortunate with the lack of lightning for the summer
4451220 weve had very very few man caused fires too which has been very helpful
4451221 so its not that we havent had a fair amount of initial attack activity
4451222 weve just had enough well timed moisture as well as late spring early summer moisture that has limited the fire behavior

4451340 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4451341 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4451342 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4451343 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4451344 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4451345 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4451346 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4451347 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4451348 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4451349 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4451350 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4451351 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4451352 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4451353 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy

4451357 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4451358 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4451359 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4451392 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4451393 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4451394 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4451395 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4451396 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4451397 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4451398 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4451399 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4451400 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4451401 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4451402 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4451403 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4451404 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4451405 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4451406 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4451407 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4451408 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4451409 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4451410 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4451411 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4451412 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4451413 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4451414 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4451415 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4451416 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4451417 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4451418 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4451419 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4451420 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4451421 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4451422 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4451423 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4451424 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4451425 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4451426 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4451427 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4451428 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4451429 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4451430 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4451431 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4451432 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4451433 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4451434 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4451435 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4451436 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4451437 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4451438 who are open to doing something on the production side
4451439 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4451440 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4451441 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4451442 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4451443 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4451458 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4451459 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4451460 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4451461 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4451462 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4451463 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4451464 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4451465 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4451466 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4451467 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4451468 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4451469 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4451470 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4451496 it takes a movie to bring across the amazing campus wide power of even a single expertly conducted case of p c intimidation
4451497 academics often bridle at the picture of their activities presented by maloney and other conservative critics and accuse them of grossly caricaturing and exaggerating what goes on in the classroom
4451498 maybe so but so long as there are those who confuse advocacy with teaching and so long as faculty colleagues and university administrators look the other way the academy invites the criticism it receives in this documentary
4451499 with an attempt to attract a diverse audience ethnically ideologically and intellectually we encouraged attendees to prepare to ask tough penetrating questions during the q amp a evan and thor were fantastic
4451500 i was pleasantly surprised at how funny people thought it was people were laughing throughout the entire film
4451501 it was great to have the film at our school and those in attendance will definitely be looking at their experiences on campus differently in the future
4451502 it was refreshing to realize that there are people out there who realize that exposing the double standard in campus diversity doesnt make you a racist a white supremacist a neo nazi
4451503 i cant tell you how many times i have been called a racist on this campus for talking about the same sorts of biased campus policies that appear in your film your film was a rare opportunity for validation
4451504 the only thing that can be more gratifying to a filmmaker than having a packed house is having the house packed with a lively audience that responds enthusiastically
4451505 a sense of the politics of the nation as intellectually unassailable is so unquestioned in campus culture that it becomes easy to forget the rest of the country thinks differently
4451506 hopefully the film will bolster efforts to bring faculty representing a wider spectrum of views to college campuses

4451516 for russian netizens unconventional cyberwarfare winning the hearts and minds of the west became more important than crashing another server in tbilisi managing information seemed all the more urgent as there were virtually no images from the first and the most controversial element in the whole war the georgian invasion of tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia and the destruction that were one to believe the kremlins account followed shortly thereafter
4451517 as georgian troops retreated to defend their capital from russian attack the websites of their government also under fire retreated to google in an internet first georgias ministry of foreign affairs reopened its site on googles free blogger network and gave reporters a gmail address to reach the national security council
4451518 the attacks have already managed to compromise several government web sites with continuing ddos attacks against numerous other georgian government sites prompting the government to switch to hosting locations to the u s with georgias ministry of foreign affairs undertaking a desperate step in order to disseminate real time information by moving to a blogspot account
4451519 rather than blame the notorious russian business network rbn as researcher jart armin did over the weekend other researchers said tuesday that it appears the attacks originated from a hacker militia of russian botnet herders and volunteers
4451520 i had a simple research objective to test how much damage someone like me who is quite aloof from the kremlin physically and politically could inflict upon georgias web infrastructure acting entirely on my own and using only a laptop and an internet connection if i succeeded that would somewhat contradict the widely shared assumption at least in most of the western media that the kremlin is managing this cyberwarfare in a centralized fashion
4451521 is it possible that the russian government encouraged or even hired hackers to trash georgia web sites you bet it is do we have the foggiest idea how many of the attacks were from government connected types and how many were from outsiders like morozov unfortunately we dont
4451522 in mid july as there were some increased tensions between russia and georgia over these regions under dispute we began seeing an attack commanded to a large botnet that was directed to flood the georgian presidents web site with requests to load the page repeatedly as fast as possible
4451523 compared to the may 2007 estonian attacks these are more intense but have lasted so far for less time this could be due to a number of factors including more sizeable botnets with more bandwidth better bandwidth at the victims changes in our observations or other factors on average attackers are throwing 211 mbps at targeted systems in assaults that last for an average of just over two hours at a time
4451524 in an intriguing cyber alliance two estonian computer experts are scheduled to arrive in georgia by evening to keep the countrys networks running amid an intense military confrontation with russia and poland has lent space on its presidents web page for georgia to post updates on its ongoing conflict with russia
4451525 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites the georgian ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement the kremlin denied the accusations on the contrary a number of internet sites belonging to the russian media and official organisations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks a spokesman said it was the first time a known cyber attack had coincided with a shooting war experts warned it was unlikely to be the last
4451526 attacks have continued even after the presidents website was transferred to another hosting company in the united states the new host atlanta based firm tulip systems founded by georgian born nino doijashvili has reported spurious traffic to the server outnumbering genuine traffic by as much as 5 000 to 1 the site was still unavailable at the time of writing so the ongoing cyber attack seems to be succeeding georgian media telecommunications and transportation servers were also attacked
4451527 the online battle which appears to have begun before the first shots were fired a week ago is a preview of a new era in warfare one the u s is not ready for government officials and security experts say
4451528 national intelligence director michael mcconnell told a senate committee that the united states is ill prepared for cyberattacks that could steal data or cause disruptions he mentioned china and russia as potential threats mcconnell said the military is best protected but the federal government and private companies are vulnerable
4451529 the cyberattacks in georgia are re energizing a debate over whether the laws of war apply in cyberspace among the biggest questions when is a cyberattack an act of war
4451530 the u s air force is considering mothballing plans for its cyber command program it may seem an odd time to halt development for a cyber defense program given the attention cast on cyber warfare this week in georgia however new air force leadership may have looked at the host of government organizations designed to do essentially the same task and questioned whether the unit is necessary

4451551 i decided to take these two weeks off from tournament golf as with automatic qualification now out of the question i thought it very important to put in some serious practice time so i am ready to perform to the best of my ability should i come into the reckoning for a captains selection
4451552 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared towards qualifying but i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it to the requisite 14 and a half points
4451553 hopefully the crowds will inspire me to a great week it will be a really strong tournament with so many european players in the field battling to improve their positions on the european ryder cup rankings in the final qualifying event

4451589 this decision on wednesday by the security cabinet represents a change in israeli policy after always firmly separating hizbullah and the lebanese government
4451590 as responsible for any event that takes place in its sovereign territory or events for which lebanese nationals are responsible
4451591 in the coming weeks israel plans to start transmitting this message to the united nations united states russia and european nations and primarily to syria and hizbullah itself
4451592 the us claimed that bombing lebanese infrastructure would topple the moderate siniora government
4451593 the first is the fact hizbullah is now a partner in a lebanese unity government and holds veto rights
4451594 the second is that the policy statement of the new lebanese government approved by president michel sleiman allows hizbullah to continue its military activity against israel

4451596 we commit to doing everything in our power to abide by this commandment and to devote at least half an hour a week toward this effort
4451597 god commanded us in his torah build me a temple and i shall dwell amongst you
4451598 all of israel must do everything they can to obey this commandment
4451599 deceased general mota gur said during the conquest of east jerusalem in the six day war the temple mount is in our hands and i say now the temple is in our hands
4451600 the treaty we composed contains a bunch of suggestions like temple studies embroidering priestly clothes illustration for books on the subject enhancing awareness fundraising or any other activity we believe can further the building of the temple
4451601 no clause calls for the launching of law missiles or the exploding of the mosque at the temple mount

4451608 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister
4451609 for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations
4451610 olmert told us his goal is to reach an agreement on paper
4451611 we have good answers to the threats and scenarios that we foresee in the region
4451612 there is no such thing as a 100 percent solution but the way we provide an answer to ballistic missiles is improving all the time
4451613 by making it appear indian with references to hindu scriptures and great poets people will not come to the truth this is a complete turn back from the real bible
4451614 i am sure this bible made in india and for indians will bring the word of god closer to millions of our people not only christians
4451615 work alone is your proper business never the fruits it may produce
4451616 it will take some time for the new bible to gain acceptance
4451617 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
4451618 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
4451619 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
4451620 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
4451621 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
4451622 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
4451623 right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
4451624 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
4451625 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4451626 spellberg thinks there is a very real possibility of major danger for the building and staff and widespread violence

4451629 viewers will be deeply moved by the participants personal journeys i believe that a major nationwide evangelism initiative could be launched on the back of the series
4451630 the broadcast will doubtless be accompanied by the percussive sound of thousands of christians enthusiastically smashing their foreheads against the wall with delight at the way theyre represented
4451631 an awe inspiring cathedral thats almost 1 000 years old where they are asked to participate in a communion service
4451632 its not just a very big city in this world it is in many senses the iconic city it represents western democracy

4451634 i dont think its hyperbole to call this big brotherish
4451635 the new york city police department is creating a huge computer database of the movement of everyone in a vehicle in manhattan
4451636 it is always a balance between freedoms to come and go between civil liberties and security and i think we pretty much have the balance pretty much right
4451637 i guess i would feel safer in light of everything that happened
4451638 the city has been under a lot of you know pressures and stuff
4451639 i dont know want everybody or someone knowing where im at 24 hours a day
4451640 final declaration of the yale common word conference july 2008
4451641 it seems that the implications of this verse were not realized or discussed
4451642 this is a step towards affirming that muhammad is a prophet and the quran a word of god
4451643 as christians we affirm that the promises of abraham are fulfilled in christ
4451644 no muslim or christian should tolerate the denigration or desecration of one anothers sacred symbols founding figures or places of worship
4451645 we raise these issues because of our concern for the biblical christian faith and for the implications of the common word process for christian minorities in muslim lands christian mission in muslim lands and converts from islam to christianity around the world
4451646 although we respect and love muslims christians cannot accept islam as an equal and valid revelation from god the denial of the deity of christ and his redemptive work as well as of the trinity will always stand in the way of interfaith dialogue and co operation
4451647 just as muslims cannot accept the christian denial of muhammads prophethood and the qurans status as the word of god so christians must take a clear stand on the central doctrines of their faith
4451648 fully affirms and supports all endeavors to work for peace in this torn world
4451649 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
4451650 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
4451651 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
4451652 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
4451653 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
4451654 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
4451655 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
4451656 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
4451657 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
4451658 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the r b n and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
4451659 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services
4451660 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one
4451661 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principles of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading the muslims borrowed rituals and traditions from all the surrounding religions
4451662 when i was with my father i in effect pushed a moderate hamas leader into making logical decisions such as stopping the attacks and establishing two states alongside one another
4451663 i felt responsible it was better for me to be there rather than a gang of fools who would poison his mind
4451664 i tried to understand those people their thoughts in order to change them from inside by means of a strong person like my father who admitted to me in the past that he does not support suicide attacks
4451665 he thinks that harming innocent people gives the organization a bad name
4451666 i sat in megiddo prison and suddenly i understood who the real hamas was
4451667 these people have no morals they have no integrity but they arent as stupid as fatah which steals in broad daylight in front of everyone and is immediately suspected of corruption hamas people receive money in dishonest ways invest it in secret places and outwardly maintain a simple lifestyle
4451668 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
4451669 i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
4451670 you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
4451671 they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed
4451672 are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise
4451673 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
4451674 what do you do when you come to a passage in the bible that you dont agree with
4451675 its quite disturbing its a small street and everyone gets on with everybody for this to happen here is quite shocking
4451676 ive seen them about they keep themselves to themselves they dont speak the father speaks but the sons dont
4451677 they keep themselves to themselves i was shocked slightly you dont expect it on your doorstep but thats life it could happen anywhere
4451678 they were quite a law abiding family theyve never been in trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
4451679 i was shocked when i learned feroze was involved in terrorism and i am equally shocked there have been arrests again so close to where i live
4451680 this has come out of the blue again the community was very calm back then and it is now
4451681 we support the role of the police in carrying out activities to protect the country
4451682 if there are people engaged in terrorism then we absolutely support the police in their work and encourage anyone with information to pass that to the police
4451683 we encourage people to be cautious because there have been numerous occasions where those arrested have turned out to be innocent
4451684 the police have a role to play but with that role comes responsibility
4451685 the most interesting thing in this years report is that the increase in population between 2006 and 2007 was the highest single year rise since just after the second world war
4451686 the most important factor is migration an increase in birth rate contributed a bit but that would only increase the population of scotland by about 1 000
4451687 in fact the population increased by about 27 000 and the remaining 26 000 was because the number of people coming into scotland exceeded the number of people going out of scotland
4451688 its a trend that can be seen over the last five years
4451689 whether it continues or not is the 64 000 dollar question
4451690 were not in the business of taking licences away just because weve got too many this is a historical thing that has been allowed to build up over the years
4451691 it is a cultural centre and you can see that particularly at this time of the year but if you look around the city there an awful lot of for sale signs up and some pubs are going to the wall so perhaps thats the situation catching up on a few places
4451692 this is good it shows that it is now being taken seriously whereas in the past perhaps it fell under the radar
4451693 he was in direct contact with his russian counterpart defense minister anatoly serdyukov who assured him that russia had no intention of sending its troops south into georgia
4451694 yes i can work those with a child who starts kindergarten in 2 weeks
4451695 jason whats the fucking deal it is just a videogame
4451696 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4451697 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4451698 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4451699 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4451700 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4451701 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4451702 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4451703 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4451704 then i came out saw 20 30 people run to the school bus and they were like oh my god theres somebody over here and went to lift
4451705 about 20 of us just get underneath the bus and start lifting up the bus they pull her out from underneath there then they see that shes pregnant
4451706 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4451707 i tried to go behind her but she stopped and moved back and i hit her
4451708 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4451709 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and that we are forever grateful
4451710 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4451711 we expect that russia will respect the humanitarian nature of that mission and that ports sea lanes air routes will all be open for humanitarian purposes another pledge that russia has undertaken to the french
4451712 there are plans for another flight tomorrow as we continue to assess the wide range of humanitarian assistance options that we might be able to provide both in the immediate and long term humanitarian capabilities
4451713 i am going first to meet with the french president and other members of the french government in france
4451714 and then i will fly on to tbilisi to underscore the strong support of the united states for the georgian people and for their democratically elected government
4451715 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
4451716 there is a bit of russian in all of us
4451717 the advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has russian roots
4451718 bob was a dedicated member of the toronto fire services
4451719 his contribution to public safety and emergency planning was in the interests of the citizens of toronto and toronto fire services
4451720 as firefighters and fire chiefs we share the grief being experienced by the toronto fire services and by the citizens of toronto
4451721 every firefighter and officer knows that he or she is in one of canadas truly dangerous professions that knowledge joins all of us in mourning district fire chief leek
4451722 the phosphor emerges to guide my direction my dreams fly high and it takes me to the place faraway i open my arms to embrace the fresh air and freedom here honors are achieved and dreams are realized one world one dream thats all about us no fears no hunger no faithless not at all
4451723 this is a sport for the whole world when every day and night is passed in joy its a game for the whole world where you and me will make a new entry to the history of the olympics let the five ring flags fly on every street corner and love will permeate across national boundaries
4451724 youd like to establish some go to guys studs you have to feed the ball to
4451725 we definitely want to have four guys who can go out there and make plays and maybe a fifth that can help keep people fresh
4451726 im not going to rotate guys just to rotate them were going to be in shape and were going to practice hard were going to have our top guys and theyre going to be our playmakers
4451727 im not just going to sit back and say ive got a position because i dont feel no one has a position i want to be the best player on the team and i feel like those others guys feel the same way
4451728 when you get a special player and a unique player you like to play them right away and hope you get all four years out of them
4451729 its been really competitive learning all the plays and as a freshman just getting the feel of it
4451730 when you get out there you have to make plays the people that make plays are the ones who are going to be on the field no matter if youre a freshman or anything else the possibility to play just makes you work even harder
4451731 for a lot of foreigners the only image of china comes from old movies that make us look poor and pathetic
4451732 now look at us we showed the world we can build new subways and beautiful modern buildings the olympics will redefine the way people see us
4451733 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
4451734 saisonauftakt heimspiel und derby das ist schon sehr prickelnd motivieren brauch sich wohl keine mannschaft f r dieses match wir wollen dieses spiel nat rlich gewinnen wissen jedoch dass diese partie f r die asemisser schon das spiel der saison sein wird vorsicht ist also geboten

4451736 zur zeit h ngen wir in einem tiefen loch das team ist sichtlich verunsichert wir konnten unsere vorbereitungsspiele nie in der gleichen besetzung durchf hren fast alle spieler eingeschlossen meiner person spielen zur zeit weit unter ihren m glichkeiten wenn wir in retzen einen punkt entf hren k nnten k me das einer sensation gleich
4451737 wir hatten eine gute vorbereitung das team hat hervorragend mitgezogen ich bin optimistisch das wir mit einem sieg in die serie starten werden
4451738 der tus lockhausen ist schwer f r uns einzusch tzen die mannschaft geht nach dem abstieg aus der bezirksliga mit einem fast komplett neuem team in die serie dennoch wir wollen dieses spiel gewinnen
4451739 ich habe da einen haufen junger wilder zusammen der sich erst noch finden muss ich denke wir m ssen zun chst kleinere br tchen backen w re mit einem punkt in bentorf zufrieden
4451740 gerade in der offensive sch tze ich den sv sehr stark ein dennoch wir wollen dort dreifach punkten auch wenn das nicht leicht sein wird
4451741 wir haben ein gute vorbereitung gehabt und wir wollen mit einem sieg in die saison starten
4451742 beim sportfest wollen wir einen guten start hinlegen ein gutes spiel abliefern und das nat rlich m glichst erfolgreich
4451743 wir haben vor niemanden angst allerdings wird die tsg mit der aufstiegseuphorie in das spiel gehen da hei t es in allen belangen dagegen zu halten
4451744 ein schweres auftaktspiel f r uns und das auch noch auf kunstrasen ich erwarte einen harten kampf
4451745 wir d rften den au enseiter in diesem spiel stellen doch wir werden nicht defensiv agieren werden versuchen dem gegner unser spiel aufzuwingen
4451746 ich denke das wird ein duell auf augenh he ich hoffe dass wir diesmal einen guten saisonstart hinlegen
4451747 wir wollen in diesem spiel unbedingt dreifach punkten auch wenn wir uns in den letzten jahren immer schwer gegen den tsv getan haben
4451748 love doesnt put food on the table love doesnt get you a job love doesnt pay the mortgage

4451767 what will u s suburbs look like in 40 years
4451768 the suburbs have three destinies none of them exclusive as materials salvage as slums and as ruins
4451769 if gentrification continues in a significant way large numbers of suburban households looking for urban stimulation may end up switching places with minority central city dwellers stirring the ethnic pot in both places
4451770 suburbia will be flexible it will be smarter and it will be hybrid

4451806 over the past few days theres been a consternation about the future of pr mostly based on my rant about pr the other day and how its so refreshing to hear about a new company from its users first especially when those users are very excited about the product
4451807 i think it has to sink in itll be very different when i finally get back in the fall
4451808 basically im looking for a different challenge in my life

4451811 i told him if i dont re sign with wfan it has nothing to do with him and i
4451812 but i think in the end this was probably more of a different vision about what the future may hold
4451813 i expect nothing less than to be successful but i understand its a great challenge
4451814 it wont be a co hosting situation it will be my show but i want to have personalities and other opinions and other voices

4451818 el costo de las energ as renovables est bajando y aumenta su competitividad
4451819 se observa un s lido mercado para las energ as renovables y en las ltimas dos d cadas estas tecnolog as han visto tasas de crecimiento anuales de 20 a 30 en los mercados
4451820 tienen una instalaci n total de 17 gigawatts de energ a e lica y una base total de energ a solar de 1 gigawatts con una instalaci n de cerca 250 megas de energ a solar el a o pasado
4451821 para todas estas tecnolog as los mercados se ven robustos s lidos consolidados y apoyados no s lo por inversiones federales sino tambi n por pol ticas estatales y regionales que incluir an normas de cartera renovables similares a la ley que est en chile donde se requiere que un porcentaje de la generaci n el ctrica provenga de renovables
4451822 el a o pasado la inversi n total en activos que van de capital de riesgo a fusiones adquisiciones y financiamiento de desarrollo de productos fue de 150 mil millones de d lares y se estima que crezca en las pr ximas d cadas sobre los 450 mil millones de d lares son metas altas y fijas en muchos pa ses incluyendo a china que tiene pol ticas agresivas en ese sentido
4451823 por la presencia de un ambiente propicio para las inversiones en esta materia y el apoyo del marco regulador
4451824 sin embargo el nuevo entorno pol tico que incluye muchos de los decretos que se discuten en el congreso ven plazos de 40 50 o hasta 60 a os

4451829 que ser n remplazas por nuevas tecnolog as para cumplir con pol ticas de seguridad y financieras como tambi n un nuevo sistema de transmisi n
4451830 el desaf o de abordar eso es impulsado por un proceso consenso donde las partes tienen que juntarse y decidir si permitir autorizar una l nea de transmisi n en cierta rea y que exista un financiamiento disponible
4451831 nosotros hemos considerado una planificaci n de m s largo plazo para ver el potencial de generar 20 de la energ a como e lica y hay un modelo econ mico complejo que tambi n incluye la construcci n de torres de transmisi n para llegar a ese 20 ser a necesario construir 12 mil millas de l neas de transmisi n y eso es porque el viento est donde est y los centros de demanda est n donde est n

4451857 the canadian football league and the national football league can survive in this country together
4451858 if you get 35 000 people in the stands in the cfl youre making a profit
4451859 im sure toronto can handle that and two or three games from the nfl
4451860 i think it will be great entertainment for the toronto community and i think everyone wants to see the nfl play because we all watch the games on sunday
4451861 i think it will be great for the city here
4451862 i think football especially the nfl wants to become a north american market
4451863 it wont be overnight it will take five or six years but that would be a godsend it would be nice to see the most competitive league and most prosperous league competing in our city

4451879 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4451880 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4451881 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4451882 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4451883 we are now able to perform a secondary analysis with an emphasis on those who have reached clinical normalcy
4451884 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4451885 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
4451886 part of the obama campaigns concerted effort to signal a more moderate approach to abortion in hope of attracting more roman catholic and evangelical votes
4451887 really matters is what obama says about it and how much emphasis he gives the issue

4451891 paying medicare premiums directly from social security benefits should be an easy way to make sure seniors dont have to deal with a bill in the mail and to save taxpayer dollars on administrative costs but the way its set up now the withholding process is a mess that discourages medicare recipients from signing up for it

4451902 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev 1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4451903 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev 1
4451904 the rate of decline in fev 1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4451905 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev 1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4451906 although treatment did not abolish the accelerated decline in lung function that occurs with copd it did ameliorate it substantially
4451907 the mechanism responsible for the effect on rate of decline is not clear as all treatments have potentially significant nonbronchodilator effects
4451908 the torch study brings some clarity to the treatment picture and provides some hopeful signs for patients with copd
4451909 this study also demonstrates that no treatment placebo is not an option for patients with moderate to severe copd

4451934 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia
4451935 despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels
4451936 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up
4451937 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points
4451938 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it
4451939 i think the whole of formula 1 is very excited about going to valencia
4451940 its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there
4451941 we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit
4451942 with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful
4451943 its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
4451944 one of the key aspects is that it is going to be very windy
4451945 the americas cup is held in valencia for this very reason however such conditions could make achieving a good balance on the cars quite tricky
4451946 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive
4451947 the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style
4451948 also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually
4451949 it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
4451950 they street circuits are very demanding as they are often bumpy and the street surface changes
4451951 when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers
4451952 there will be lots of run off areas for safety reasons the fia puts a lot of effort into safety which is good
4451953 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
4451954 it will be an authentic street circuit in the sense that it runs through the town centre unlike the melbourne or montreal tracks
4451955 in terms of its charms and challenges the valencia race will probably come closest to the monaco grand prix
4451956 the short summer break after the race in budapest has benefited everyone
4451957 now we are embarking on the remaining three european races and four overseas gps with renewed vigour
4451958 our aim is to continue on from the good results of the first half of the season
4451959 im sorry i just dont feel right about this wheres that resume again
4451960 resume my samples are my resume everybody ive done all my work for has been very satisfied

4451967 unfortunately its only good if things dont get too hot out there in the world but it sure looks good and thats whats important go ahead put it on
4451968 youll get used to it theres really nothing to this
4451969 now here is the piece de resistance your save the world poverty bill t shirt worth only 845 billion dollars
4451970 you are kidding me sam right this is what makes the whole ensemble work think how good you are going to look to everybody in the world
4451971 that white universal health care shirt with the extra long arms you were talking about the one thats fastened with tacks or taxes i was already going to charge that on credit and
4451972 oh no need to talk about that now give me credit for knowing what im doing
4451973 well its show time sam walk out there and impress the world
4451974 i see you are enjoying the services of this tailor he is like many i have commissioned myself i have really looked forward to seeing you like this its the real you
4451975 you did this to me and now ive got no money to buy a real suit with proper red white and blue why youre fired

4451977 weve got a contract for four years bwah ha ha ha
4451978 our unconscious mind often warns us about the path an illness might take if we dont seek treatment
4451979 well where are those good old maverick pills they may not be flashy but they have a proven track record of working not like the snake oil that skinny fella with the big ears had me swallow
4451980 i know for a fact you guys care about me youre all so anxious to give me bad tasting medicine thats good for me arent you
4451981 oh yes we love seeing you take bad tasting medicine
4451982 i guess i understand the slogan on this bottle of snake oil now change theres nothing to it

4451987 this helps because a lot of things escalate beyond where it should be because someone has an opportunity to use a gun so any gun we can take off the street and out of the hands of a potential criminal is a good thing and its not an end all to fighting crime but it is one component
4451988 cutting these programs means yet another hurdle for our artists
4451989 culture is central to our social and economic lives funding cutbacks such as these not only hurt our artists directly but also hurt efforts being made to bring our cultural product to the international marketplace
4451990 theres mr adams right at the top with his captains and right below is his lieutenants
4451991 are the people that are moving a lot of dope through this county
4451992 it really was overextending with a plan that was designed to provide a lot of benefits for a sick population
4451993 this was spent providing benefits to eligible people a lot of ill people have derived benefits
4451994 our staff was capable but in the end we were not good enough
4451995 its not going to be straightened out by october the start of the 2008 09 fiscal year but its going to be straighter
4451996 i know a lot of people are in the same situation im in
4451997 if youre politely or aggressively angry at us you should be
4451998 we did not do an excellent job thats for sure i think we did the best job we could with what we had to work with
4451999 with the probable elimination of the community outreach grants we are facing the very real possibility of not being able to keep the haley center functioning
4452000 larger babies do better it could have an important implication for babys health
4452001 were becoming more ethnically mixed but our growth is next to nothing
4452002 their postpartum physical health or emotional health interfered at least some with their ability to care for their baby
4452003 we knew we were going to win one day that optimism never left us
4452004 if someone has made it to the age of 75 and they dont have an elevated psa the likelihood of them developing clinically significant prostate cancer in the last 10 to 15 years of their life is pretty low
4452005 more than in any election i can remember the vice presidential choices made by these candidates stand to make a significant difference especially among undecided voters
4452006 lay things out in a film style a comic book style
4452007 larger babies do better it could have an important implication for babys health
4452008 were becoming more ethnically mixed but our growth is next to nothing
4452009 their postpartum physical health or emotional health interfered at least some with their ability to care for their baby

4452014 i wouldnt be able to get through it without them
4452015 the economy compounds over and over on the community in many different ways
4452016 most of our clients are happy because somebody will listen to them
4452017 you really get to make a difference in somebodys life and especially in todays market
4452018 its like the david and goliath thing you actually get to help the david sometimes fight the giant
4452019 the people of florida depend on our expediency in putting their dollars to work
4452020 aggressively move forward with projects that will create jobs and make the sunshine state even brighter
4452021 the governor hasnt made a decision on what he might do
4452022 youre generating dollars that will be spent and generate taxes it wont be a lot but every little bit helps
4452023 this is the largest back to back year to year decrease in state funding you have to go back to the great depression to find an impact like this
4452024 were saying to them were not going to just stand by and take another 5 or 10 percent reduction in our funding its not going to work
4452025 i recognize the difficult situation the legislators are in but tearing out the safety net of our society is not the solution
4452026 if i take a charter fishing boat in the state of florida i dont have to pay any taxes on the trip
4452027 now whos chartering a fishing boat someone who can afford to pay 6 or 7 percent tax
4452028 and on one i missed that tackle it bothers me because i should have made it
4452029 there is a right way to do things and a wrong way
4452030 i have just always believed that no matter what i have done you do things the right way you do them the way theyre supposed to be done and you work hard until they are perfect
4452031 thats why i was so frustrated the other day after that scrimmage i understand why i am playing limited plays coaches talked to me about it and they are right we dont need me to get injured in camp but at the same time it goes against my nature to sit out and i dont like it i feel like every play every rep in drills is an opportunity to get better and im missing out on those chances to improve myself
4452032 i was taking on a bull rush and when i punched out it kind of popped out to the side a little bit
4452033 i dont know if he got more work but he got more balls thrown to him today
4452034 so far so good hes coming on saturday will be another stepping stone for him and well keep progressing until opening day
4452035 to run as much as we did after two practices today at this point i think thats an indication theyre in great shape i think everyone knows the great job that buddy morris and james smith do it makes a difference i think a lot of teams come to camp to get in shape for the season we come to camp to get ready for the season not to get in shape but to get ready were one step beyond that
4452036 the reason that this is an issue at schools nationwide is that we have competing interests
4452037 wer seine finger in alle l cher steckt der zieht sie oft bel heraus
4452038 man muss das pferd schmieden solange es reis i t
4452039 not a nice way to go perhaps but a swift one and one that guaranteed immortality of a sort for these strange creatures
4452040 hes inside his own head and he knows if its best for him and his patients to retire
4452041 out here im working as hard as i did in neurosurgery
4452042 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4452043 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4452044 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4452045 if we were in palm springs we wouldnt need the indoor courts
4452046 we have to get him ready to go to jesus
4452047 there are no excuses for this to happen to any baby
4452048 this is murder he had no reason to die he died because he cried
4452049 i mean not only did crystal and craig lose a son but crystal lost a husband and craigs parents lost a son and a grandson one day this was a happy perfect family and the next day its been devastated
4452050 maybe they both could have used a meeting that night
4452051 like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut
4452052 they pulled together they prayed together they took baby camryn off life support together
4452053 and that was a wonderful thing that they were able to pull together like that despite craig being alleged to have done these things
4452054 i dont care what craigs family members think he did this to my son may he get what he deserves maybe people should talk more about camryn than craig craigs name has no worth to even be mentioned
4452055 the question becomes if that autopsy is accurate if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions multiple occasions how come no one knew that
4452056 he only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured what other folks in the household could have injured him then craig quickly took responsibility
4452057 no matter what happens craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison
4452058 if thats the breadwinner or the main breadwinner then youve got some serious financial problems right off the bat
4452059 i lost my job because of this because i couldnt work enough hours now i have to move into a smaller place
4452060 it will be the basis for divorces itll be the basis for the kind of family conflict that then brings into play maternal and paternal grandparents and the extended family on both sides and we end up with a lot of conflict
4452061 i cant have hate eat me up and beat me down i cant live like that
4452062 i will have to one day forgive him so that i might find peace
4452063 but i want to say one thing to the american people i want you to listen to me im going to say this again i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky i never told anybody to lie not a single time never these allegations are false and i need to go back to work for the american people thank you
4452064 i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth
4452065 i just thought this was the time to come forward and reveal this
4452066 please get the joke out of your system now i dont know if ill be able to handle it being told to all of the surrounding tables after one too many bloody marys
4452067 this is a place that brings out the ultimate reality that depicts uganda as a country extremely gifted by nature and the pearl of africa
4452068 our mission is to set up a 15 hectare eco tourism facility with a botanical garden of trees and flowers mixed with tropical fruits
4452069 we also intend to construct tree houses using locally treated poles of palm trees commonly known as
4452070 but this school already charges fees much higher than others
4452071 its two hundred degrees out here mrs supa may we please come in
4452072 neat do you have a big family i mean counting everyone on your moms side and your dads side
4452073 yes we have a very big family but its my dad and my brother who are on my side yep pretty much its me my brother and my dad my mom and sister are on the other side we stick together because the girls in our family theyre crazy
4452074 the first time i noticed a subterfuge was on canned tuna
4452075 all of a sudden tuna was on sale in every grocery store i stocked up one day i looked at a can purchased before the sale and noticed the can i bought on sale had been reduced by an ounce the can looked the same but the content was less
4452076 i consider this tricking the consumer into thinking they are buying more than they are getting i think it all started with a male executive who thought because more women are working wives they were shopping like men and not paying attention to such details as weights and measures so they made the packaging look the same while reducing the content
4452077 is that when a brand name product goes on sale at every store at the same time you better check the weights and measures
4452078 who gave you the right to take the constitution and shove it down the toilet who gave you the right to take impeachment off the table nobody told them to do this

4452082 i am on cloud nine since ive gotten the gold
4452083 i was so nervous it was my first olympics and i wanted to really perform well because i had three other guys that were depending on me to swim fast but all the preparation all the training that ive done prepared me for it
4452084 i had cpr done and i came back and i was like whats next it didnt even faze me
4452085 i was devastated to see that blacks and hispanics are almost three times more likely to drown than their counterparts
4452086 to think back to my story when i was 5 i could have easily been added to the number
4452087 america i am encourages all people to connect in a meaningful way with the foundations of democracy cultural diversity exploration and free enterprise which began when the first africans arrived in jamestown
4452088 by telling the stories and the events of the past we can help the leaders of the future set the stage for active participation in the democratic process for years to come
4452089 the agencys time there has not been a happy story
4452090 there have been thousands of units of affordable housing developed and a substantial investment made in the community but those things are in no way envisioned as making up for the damage that was done in the early days
4452091 there is no way to make up for clearing large swaths of land and displacing thousands of people
4452092 the agency would go to a house and give the head of household a certificate that said they would be given preference in housing built in the future
4452093 but there wasnt a lot of housing built for a long time
4452094 people say black folks chose to sell their homes but thats not true
4452095 we couldnt get loans to fix up the houses so we didnt have a choice but to sell or crumble there was a mean spiritedness that occurred during the entire process
4452096 there is still frustration hopelessness and a negative mind set on the part of the african american community because of what redevelopment did
4452097 in yesteryears there was a sense of community with victorian homes and black owned businesses
4452098 they wiped out our community weakened our institutional base and never carried out their promise to bring people back
4452099 but how much of that went to african americans i would guess about 6 percent if the objective is to stimulate african american economics and business that is not enough
4452100 there is so much resentment because people feel like they havent been heard
4452101 nobody seems ready to deal with whats happened and fix it and move on the people most impacted have not benefited at all there were so many black businesses that closed and will not be able to come back
4452102 on the whole people are very dissatisfied i dont know if we can fix it
4452103 we need to legislate outcomes that make it better we need to create housing work and business opportunities we need legislation that speaks to the pain and suffering
4452104 we should look at the mistakes made in the 40 years in the western addition and make sure the rest of san francisco is not having the same kind of experience
4452105 the fillmore should be a lesson for the bayview not a harbinger
4452106 they expect people not to be emotional after 40 years thats as mean as you can get
4452107 we are glad they will be gone but it would be better if they had never come
4452108 our community is gone and never coming back and that is painful
4452109 white northerners had a rather complacent and self satisfied attitude that anti black prejudice and anti black violence in particular was largely a southern problem and one of the really shocking things about the well publicized springfield race riot and its association with abraham lincoln was that the north had a race problem
4452110 they clearly wanted to mete out lethal justice there on the spot
4452111 went from one end to the other looting homes damaging homes and ultimately setting them on fire by the time they were through theyd displaced at least 40 families
4452112 largely working class rioters were expressing resentment over visible black success and influence in the community
4452113 from the perspective of many springfield residents who were white justice was not done in the end
4452114 90210 was a huge hit tv show when having virgin high school student characters was still marginally believable

4452119 the city is experiencing growth yet were losing african american families disproportionately
4452120 suggests that white flight from large cities may have bottomed out in the 1990s
4452121 if the school is saying its ok to give out ice cream while at the same time theyre holding workshops on how to deal with your kids type 2 diabetes maybe we should rethink the message were sending
4452122 i dont think the battleground against gentrification should take place in the schools
4452123 children will suffer the effects of negative stigma as a result of this segregation which will send our city back 120 years
4452124 i honestly felt like they didnt want to mix our children with their children
4452125 we obviously would not and could not open segregated schools
4452126 tax dollars should follow the children and not the school
4452127 but you also need to adjust to the environment youre in
4452128 demographics are in our favor were attracting the folks that are moving in
4452129 the greatness of our city and region is in its diversity
4452130 san francisco has so few blacks now that its just an act of faith to stay open
4452131 whatever the definition of black power is it certainly existed in new philadelphia
4452132 it is a story of people overcoming hardship and succeeding in the face of what most people would fail at
4452133 archeology is not just looking at rocks and pieces of pottery its what this represents
4452134 many many white detroiters think of the riot as having caused the citys problems its exactly the opposite
4452135 the riot was a consequence of a manifestation of its deep problems
4452136 blight is creeping like a fungus through many of detroits proud old neighborhoods
4452137 the riots roots lay in unemployment poverty and powerlessness all caused by an urban system that couldnt provide people with jobs opportunity and hope
4452138 the riots were certainly a negative but not the sole cause of this
4452139 for some decades detroit has been the most negatively stereotyped major city in the country part of that i suspect is attributable to the riot and its consequences
4452140 the most precipitous group exodus was in the wake of the political battles that were waged in detroit after and because of the riot and in the wake of the finale of those battles the election of young
4452141 we are delighted to welcome thermabate into the fold we are always looking to improve the service we offer our customers and the thermabate range perfectly complements our existing products
4452142 we wanted to show off wv heritage and the pride of our state the black angel is a theme given to the rescue workers that break through the cloud of dust and its like the sun shining through to them so we decided to go with black color for the black angel and show off that wv mines coal
4452143 the philippine cement industry produces more than what the domestic market is able to consume that is why it is important for cement companies to continue to be efficient in order to be profitable
4452144 were heavily energy dependent so its a function of that for as long as the energy prices continue to rise and energy prices in the philippines are among the highest in asia if not the world that of course will have an effect on the business
4452145 to identify products that are manufactured in an environmentally responsible way
4452146 in cemex our commitment to environmental responsibility goes beyond our corporate communications activities and extends and pervades many areas of our operations
4452147 were not aware of any previous reports that a cement factory would have this level of hexavalent chromium related risk but the fact of the matter is we have sampled downwind of the facility weve sampled upwind of the facility we cross checked and did backward calculations using air quality modeling and its our best professional opinion that this is coming from the riverside cement plant
4452148 theyre making an assumption we believe at this point in time that were the source of that high concentration and we need to go through a advertisement verification process to verify their findings
4452149 the cost reduction could be in the range of as much as 10 15 there is a tremendous shortage of affordable housing in this country hence such a move could greatly benefit the real estate sector as a whole
4452150 in 2007 a large percentage of our sales came from outside of north america
4452151 our markets around the world are growing and we want to provide them with world class products designed and produced locally to their local specifications manufacturing globally will shorten lead times for all customers as the addition of this new plant will also free up some of our current capacity to support customers in other regions of the world more effectively
4452152 the asia market in general and the china market specifically is learning about the importance of the lift product category
4452153 aerial work platforms are increasingly becoming more widely accepted as a safe option for people who work in high places
4452154 its more accurate than 400 pounds but we want to learn more we have proposed a series of tests well start conducting this year to really nail it down
4452155 we are serious about and sensitive to complying and going beyond we have made lots of improvements
4452156 this plant is successful because we have good quality control and we produce a high quality product
4452157 we will be watching as lafarge takes steps towards improving the environment and protecting our natural resources
4452158 its a benefit to us to have more material coming through
4452159 this is our busy season because this is when people start building and repaving
4452160 the river means everything to us we try to take care of it by not putting anything in it that will hurt it
4452161 international shippers want to get these projects as far inland as they can by water they will go the rest of the way by water or truck
4452162 those components are coming from india but if they had to build them and ship them it would be very inefficient
4452163 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 meters a little bit and try to get to an early lead
4452164 the 200 back is all legs and for ryan to come back 30 minutes later and just miss going one two in the 200 im thats a pretty incredible swim

4452166 i always feel like i can win whether its against michael phelps or anyone
4452167 it was a good place to be mentally to think that i had a chance

4452178 es un gobierno antiguo que adem s est dividido muy desorientado y que no sabe qu hacer enfatiz es sorprendente pero en cuatro meses lo que est transmitiendo es agotamiento y est generando mucha desconfianza en el conjunto de la sociedad espa ola que necesita un mensaje de esperanza y que le diga que se va a salir de la crisis pero para eso hay que tomar medidas y gobernar
4452179 el pp ha ofrecido su colaboraci n al gobierno pero es muy dif cil colaborar con quien no quiere hacerlo lo que s creo que tiene sentido es que acepte la petici n de colaboraci n que le ha hecho la oposici n manifest

4452286 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4452287 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4452288 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4452289 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4452290 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4452291 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4452292 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4452293 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4452294 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4452295 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy
4452296 other people have done it but as far as vocally its just me and ozzy its good company to be in hes the dude that basically created this niche i think it would be pretty grueling to do it for a full tour
4452297 i created the characters and the world they live in and i did the original drawings and wrote the story

4452485 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4452486 it can now be expected that this will be the beginning of the end of polish russian talks this agreement can be seen as a purely anti russian agreement
4452487 its making poland part of the u s defense system and in my view pushes poland along a well worn road of mistakes looking for allies afar and enemies nearby
4452488 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4452489 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations
4452490 it can only be regretted that in this most difficult situation the american side is aggravating relations with russia
4452491 we have set up scores of watch towers and have cameras placed in open areas crossroads and major entrances
4452492 well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap as soon as possible
4452493 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4452494 of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4452495 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalize their presence in georgia
4452496 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement

4452541 para ser sincero no nos importa una mierda lo que la gente piense de nuestra m sica
4452542 simplemente empezamos a componer o a grabar al 1000 de nuestra capacidad y todo sale del coraz n luego te abandonas a la suerte y el p blico decide como ve al material si nos preocup ramos demasiado de las reacciones estar amos en casa con los dedos cruzados estamos muy contentos con lo que hemos hecho y eso es lo principal para nosotros los m sicos se gu an por su propio sentido de la creatividad

4452544 hasta donde yo s uno de los objetivos de la universidad de las am ricas puebla no es atender a personas con capacidades distintas a las de los estudiantes por lo cual a pesar de que no estoy muy conocedor de los detalles de esto que ocurri dada de baja voluntaria de la udla de andrew almaz n me parece que es bueno para la comunidad acad mica que se den pasos para que la estructura de las escuelas mejore como en el caso de la escuela de medicina acaban de nombrar como director de la misma al doctor giovanni porras ram rez que es una persona muy destaca en la medicina poblana
4452545 existen alrededor de 40 estudiantes en la carrera de medicina y por consiguiente todos merecen una atenci n especial y no s lo este joven que tiene capacidades distintas a los dem s estudiantes
4452546 si se descuida a los dem s muchachos por atender un solo estudiante no me parece que sea muy justo para los dem s estudiantes aqu es justamente al rev s si se est n canalizando recursos que se estaban empleando para atender a este muchacho para atender a los otros 40 estudiantes me parece que es m s justo simplemente desde el punto de vista num rico no tanto es el asunto de esta persona en especial sino hay que ver el conjunto de decisiones que se han tomado
4452547 en alg n momento se pens que esta carrera de la udla se podr a cerrar pero despu s de las deliberaciones que llev a cabo el rector luis ernesto derbez bautista con los miembros del consejo de la escuela de medicina se lleg a la conclusi n de que era prudente mejorarla para darle un servicio a la comunidad cuya decisi n fue la m s acertada para que con el paso del tiempo se logre convertirla en una de las mejores escuelas de medicina del pa s

4452568 the members of the buffalo river dene nation are very disappointed that the province did not grant the oil sands exploratory permits to access energy so that the company can begin exploration work which in turn will lead to employment infrastructure improvements capacity building and eventually self sustainability for our members

4452573 for two decades the state of indiana failed to meet the most basic standard of fairness equal pay for equal work and short changed thousands of employees now the state continues to fight tooth and nail to avoid compensating employees who worked for years at a lower rate than peers with the same job description and pay grade if the state wont rectify this plain injustice were confident that the court will
4452574 while working for the state i was told by different officers that they only worked 7 5 hours a day when i found they were being paid the same as i was i had a hard time believing the state would treat employees unfairly even more incredibly the state has resisted and spent countless hours and tax dollars over the course of fifteen years to avoid fulfilling its contractual and moral responsibility to thousands of employees
4452575 the setup of this task force reflects rics dedication to fully support the government in conducting the urban renewal strategy review in all stages aging buildings in disrepair and inadequate urban planning is creating more problems than expected the recent detrimental fire hazard occurred at cornwall court which has brought along tremendous loss of human lives and property is also a result of aging structure and urban mix this task force brings together key representatives from the public sector private practice and enterprises and also academia aiming at offering professional and pragmatic solutions for the government while allowing the public to share the positive results at the end
4452576 since the promulgation of the current urs in 2001 to guide the work of the ura the government and the authority have accumulated a lot of experience in urban renewal work at the same time there have been very noticeable changes in the values and aspirations of the public with regard to heritage conservation preservation of social networks and building maintenance and restoration in response to these changes the government has introduced new policies and measures these include a new heritage conservation policy announced by the chief executive in his 2007 08 policy address as well as various statutory and administrative measures to enhance building maintenance taking all these into account we believe it is an opportune time to conduct a comprehensive review of the urs to ensure that it will continue to reflect the values and priorities of the community

4452579 our banking industry clients are increasingly seeking electronic signature solutions

4452581 teaming with csc represents the next step in our continuous efforts to truly deliver end to end solutions and services to meet the complex and broad needs of financial services organizations
4452582 we are now able to offer the industry a complete hosted or licensed solution and an automated process that results in greatly expedited response times we look forward to working with csc and to extending our electronic signature technology to enhance cscs other financial services platforms
4452583 although the global logistics industry has been buffeted by a soft u s economy and weakness in the u s dollar during the first three quarters of the fiscal year our net revenue has benefited from a more profitable mix of business than in the prior year period along with relatively greater overall shipping activity by existing customers
4452584 operating income in our transportation logistics business segment improved 22 in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 when compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year meanwhile our bottom line continued to be negatively impacted by higher sg amp a expenses interest expense and non cash amortization costs related to our wholly owned order logistics subsidiary the companys transfer of order logistics operations from south carolina to janels chicago facilities began in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and was completed in the third quarter as a result computer software related revenue was negatively impacted during both periods we remain optimistic that order logistics revenue growth will accelerate in future quarters and that its contribution to our profitability will be positive in fiscal 2009 we believe our purchase of the order logistics assets presents exciting new opportunities and that over the next several quarters this new subsidiary can prove to be as valuable an asset to our company as the core business that janel was originally built upon
4452585 shortly after the end of our third fiscal quarter we completed the acquisition of the customs brokerage book of business assets from ferrara international logistics a new jersey based logistics company with extensive experience serving importers and exporters of food products we expect the asset purchase to significantly enhance our core competency in a critically important market for the janel group and it will expand our logistical capabilities in such countries as italy vietnam brazil and india among others from a billing perspective the acquisition is retroactive to july 1 2008 and we expect ferraras book of business to increase our monthly inbound outbound shipments in the new york area alone by approximately 25 the janel groups domestic and international network of offices will also open new doors for ferraras customers by offering services in locations not previously served by that company we are very encouraged regarding prospects for increased business as a result of this acquisition and it is our objective to identify and complete similar transactions in the future
4452586 we are also very pleased with the development of our business in the caribbean basin thus far during fiscal 2008
4452587 the branding of our name in guatemala honduras and el salvador should increase the level of shipments we handle between the region and the usa and we believe ebitda contributed by caribbean basin customer relationships can increase approximately 500 000 in the fiscal year that begins october 1 2008 caribbean basin business generates higher than normal profit margins because the supply chain is short and the cost of inventory is greatly reduced by a decrease in transit time relative to our business with customers in the far east
4452588 looking forward we expect gross revenue from our existing accounts and businesses to increase by 5 to 10 in the fiscal year ending september 30 2008 to a record 78 82 million recent signs of a strengthening in the value of the u s dollar are encouraging and if such trends continue the flow of imports into the usa should begin to improve since janel is primarily an import services organization this should have a positive impact upon our sales in the upcoming fiscal year

4452600 this quarters gross margins were consistent with our previously disclosed target of between 40 45 excluding the non cash equity compensation charges we delivered a significant increase in net income on both a comparable and sequential basis despite incremental costs incurred to support a much higher revenue base
4452601 as previously discussed a non cash equity compensation charge was anticipated for the 2008 year as a result of the
4452602 rino has continued to book a significant number of new contracts with existing and new customers many which will be completed this year

4452616 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
4452617 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic with the injuries weve had as players we can all raise the bar a little bit with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season
4452618 we need to start well and get off to a flyer just keep winning man united have a few tough games early on liverpool have made some good signings and will be stronger this year we need to focus we have a good home record and if we can continue that and get off to a good start well be all right

4452630 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
4452631 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
4452632 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
4452633 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base

4452642 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
4452643 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power

4452651 my tomatoes grow from the soil with no additives those from the eu are picture perfect as if made by michelangelo but mine are better and tastier and you can eat them as they come no chemicals
4452652 that is why i plan to increase hectares under apples medicinal herbs and vegetables in the next two years
4452653 we cannot be a major exporter we cannot compete with others in terms of quantity or price we must look for particular market niches for our indigenous products wine cheese plum brandy and to sell our home grown food to tourists
4452654 the problems are small and fractured estates old and uneducated population dated technology poorly developed market infrastructure unfortunately croatia has never had a farming strategy to address those issues
4452655 they did not find it profitable to work the land and there were no punitive measures for keeping the land unused so it just lay there
4452656 and prepare for the competition once the market is fully open
4452657 but the huge german cheese market for example has only two percent of goat cheese so i do see a big chance to sell our products abroad
4452658 our vegetables are perhaps a bit more pricey but they are home grown freshly picked untreated with chemicals buyers always prefer our own products
4452659 we know we dont produce enough and well always have to import but we want to increase exports to improve the balance
4452660 the eu has lower subsidies for wine therefore it will be a shock which we want to overcome by encouraging people to invest in technology and new vineyards and focus on quality though there is not much time left
4452661 our wine makers face uncertain times with the eu membership but some of them could really benefit the eu has 500 million people so we should find a place there is always room for original local varieties of wine
4452662 as far as red wine goes i would not dream of competing with spain
4452663 heels may look glamorous on the catwalks and on hollywood stars but theyre not appropriate for day to day work wear
4452664 these dress codes apart from being blatantly sexist can lead to long term foot and back problems as women are forced to stand or walk around in high heels or ill fitting footwear
4452665 we were surprised how many times we found that employers dress codes did not permit the wearing of comfortable sensible footwear by women
4452666 employers should look at encouraging their staff to come to work in comfortable shoes and where possible provide the option of sitting

4452670 over the last year we are seeing a speculative bubble in oil this has really been the decade of the bubble there has been a tech bubble a real estate bubble and now we are seeing a commodity bubble and oil is at the vanguard of this bubble
4452671 paul you denounced the book as unfit for publication meaning
4452672 tonight is barack obama being swiftboated the man who wrote that book on john kerry now makes some incredible and even false claims about the current democratic candidate
4452673 did you as a good investigative reporter did you approach this objectively or not
4452674 in washington is paul waldman senior fellow at media matters for america
4452675 paul you denounced the book as unfit for publication meaning
4452676 four years ago mr corsi wrote co wrote a book called unfit for command that was part of the swift boat veterans for truth campaign against john kerry every single objective observer that looked at that came to the conclusion that it was just riddled with falsehoods and distortions and unbelievable claims now four years later he has come out with another book that is also riddled with distortions and falsehoods so the question is why on earth would anyone listen to what he has to say about barack obama
4452677 he talks about how many footnotes he has and how many sources he has well if you actually look at them there are dozens and dozens of citations to right wing web sites and blogs one of the people that he cites as a quote unquote source is a man named andy martin who is an anti semitic right wing blogger who once called a judge a dirty jew and filed so many frivolous lawsuits that hes now no longer allowed to file lawsuits so my question to mr corsi is since you cite andy martin multiple times as a source are there any other anti semitic right wing bloggers that you also use as sources or is he the only one
4452678 well i quote i can remember one quip i quote from him and its just a quip which is where he basically is saying if obama will lie about his background and his family hell lie about anything and this was in reference to the way obama presents his father in the autobiography which i write about extension extensively
4452679 this book is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited written by an individual who was discredited after he wrote a similar book to help george bush and dick cheney get reelected four years ago
4452680 you have to fight back against those who try to smear you
4452681 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is ok with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4452682 paul are you disappointed the fact that simon and schuster a division of simon and schuster publishes this book and that mary matalin the former chief aide to dick cheney is the its her imprint
4452683 right well thats how we have to understand this that imprint is run by mary matalin who was dick cheneys aide a longtime gop operative and once mr corsis book came out of course it fit right into the conservative promotion machine
4452684 all right jerome senator mccain he did it on this program promised that he this would be an issue oriented campaign no personalities driven there will be open discussions among both are you going against that concept
4452685 you know i would strongly encourage republicans not to use it i think going after someones religion is the lowest form of politics i really do i dont think youre going to see the mccain campaign use it at all but i do have to say something it was interesting to have a representative from media matters just because you have a website called media matters doesnt mean theres slime up on your site media matters is a left wing smear machine they are notorious for taking things out of context and ill point out the last 30 minutes he wasnt even able to refute anything that jerome said i really wish they would have gotten to the meat of the points that jerome was making

4452776 looks to replicate a morning show vibe during the cocktail hour but as far as barber is concerned its amateur hour hes becoming appointment television and not for the right reasons precious few have been handed such prestigious announcing slots with so little experience barber has his dream gig apparently but this viewer for one would prefer he don shoulder pads and helmet again

4452779 increased its audience on monday night 252 compared with the previous monday the networks prime time lineup which followed was up 30
4452780 we started rape on wednesday we had a horrendous amount of rain before and we started cutting when it was ridiculously wet but it dried incredibly quickly on the hill
4452781 we have cut 50ha 123 acres of gerald oats at 7 5t ha 3t acre and the combine is now stood in 6
4452782 it was a pleasure to combine but since then its gone downhill
4452783 it was all over the place ranging from 1 2 3 7t ha 0 5 1 5t acre it was very disappointing
4452784 weve got fields and fields of wheat all stood up beautifully and we cant get into them
4452785 we managed to get it cut in a dry week and all the straw baled and in
4452786 were very thankful as a lot of our neighbours havent got cutting at all
4452787 some barley has been cut in the last two days around us people are just going out and getting it cut whenever theres dry weather regardless of the moisture content
4452788 we are deeply concerned we havent cut any wheat which is unheard of
4452789 these are the worst weather conditions we have had since 1985 and weve realised we need some assistance
4452790 the yields were good but weve had at least two weeks packed up since then
4452791 well go at every opportunity but the moisture contents have been off the scale
4452792 the crops are still good with high yield potential and are still standing up but the wheat is starting to suffer because its over ripe
4452793 we are all now hoping that a two week window of dry weather to complete the task isnt too much to ask
4452794 yields have been higher than anything so far achieved during our six years together as a joint venture so there is a bright side to it all
4452795 needless to say catana is going to have a bigger proportion of the hectareage for 2009

4452800 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4452801 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4452802 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4452803 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4452804 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4452805 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4452806 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4452807 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4452808 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4452809 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4452810 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4452811 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4452812 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4452813 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more

4452821 i never knew there were so many books about us parents and children reading african american childrens literature together
4452822 but it has still resulted in two men needing hospital treatment for serious injuries
4452823 the incident took place in broad daylight in a busy area and i am sure there will be a number of people who witnessed the incident and events that led up to it
4452824 dont be afraid to take risks in your music the secret is to take it to the edge as far as you can without falling over into the precipice and making a fool of yourself but if you do its ok its worth taking the chance in the end
4452825 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world

4452827 all of us a way toward mutual understanding and reconciliation
4452828 in fact what motivates the coalition of historic site administrators
4452829 such frankness does not come easily here in the lowcountry the difficulty is especially sensitive and complicated because of race how can one celebrate charlestons historic buildings and landscape in a way that respects the suffering and absence of freedom of the enslaved without polarizing racial divisions

4452832 then i came out saw 20 30 people run to the school bus and they were like oh my god theres somebody over here and went to lift
4452833 about 20 of us just get underneath the bus and start lifting up the bus they pull her out from underneath there then they see that shes pregnant
4452834 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4452835 i tried to go behind her but she stopped and moved back and i hit her
4452836 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4452837 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and that we are forever grateful
4452838 i had some antique furniture one table that was my moms its kinda sentimental
4452839 you know a whole library of books that have taken a lifetime to collect
4452840 when i saw the roof burning on the news i knew that it was my building but i was hoping it didnt hit down to my floor i had pictures all of the work on your computer that youve been working on and documents every time i think of things i think of something else lost
4452841 try to stay positive and just you know make the best of a bad situation thats all you can do
4452842 you cant do much better than a gold and a silver
4452843 were a team the more medals we get as a team the better i dont care who wins them
4452844 people who want to be international athletes they want the limelight
4452845 i think this is a little bit more than we would normally enjoy were kind of quiet people
4452846 i would not trade having katy by my side all the time for anything in the world but i will tell you that it is when the other one is competing it is very difficult to keep your mind on your own game
4452847 granted at this olympics its been a little easier because we dont compete at the same time at world cups it is definitely a challenge when we have to compete on the same day
4452848 you can just watch and cross your fingers and thats all and just wait
4452849 i think just anybody when theyre happy in their personal life that definitely helps them
4452850 depends on the person of course but i think that is a very positive thing
4452851 you know most people wouldnt know the difference between kyokushinkai and taekwon do if practitioners of each system up and fought a death match on their front lawn

4452860 weve asked them to look at the so called ring of steel and we can learn from that
4452861 weve sent teams over there to take a look and see what theyve done
4452862 our main objective would be to through intelligence find out about a plot before it ever got to a stage where a nuclear device or a dirty bomb was coming our way
4452863 if you breed grow shoot or steal anything that may look at home on our menu then bring it in and lets do a deal
4452864 we are getting a lot more goods bartered as of late which i can only assume is due to the credit crunch
4452865 people have to look for new ways of paying and this just seemed the best option
4452866 being in the countryside we have a lot of organised shoots and people would come into the pub afterwards with all their game in the car but have nothing to do with it it just rolled on from there
4452867 one person came in recently saw the bartering board and went home and dug up their chard
4452868 we currently have bright lights rainbow chard on the board which we have put with mackerel that was bartered as well
4452869 when we get the good stuff and it gets on to the specials board its brilliant someone will say that rabbit tasted great and we say here meet the person who shot it
4452870 its also a challenge for the chef to make the most of the ingredients
4452871 we have to make sure that nothing has been poached or stolen but because it is a local pub everyone knows everyone
4452872 we find the home grown stuff is often much better than what we can get from the suppliers some of it was in the fields only hours before it is served
4452873 i have a job where i earn the national minimum wage so this little bit of extra money helps me get out
4452874 exchange of goods or services for other goods or services
4452875 no bet ter example of the cartoonists art dedicated to faith in god and country has been seen in this gen eration
4452876 if i charged newspapers for the service many would be unable to use it and i believe this tension filled world needs any word of hope it can get
4452877 im a regular visitor to the states so when i saw that image on the back of it i instantly knew that it was a us city not birmingham in the west midlands so i
4452878 i am sure this was a simple mistake by whoever was asked to find a picture of the city but who is checking this stuff i cant understand why no one noticed before it was sent out
4452879 there is no point tinkering with it the picture on the leaflet is meant to symbolically represent an urban area
4452880 it was not a mistake it is a generic skyline picture which is meant to symbolically represent an urban area
4452881 we have to respect the culture of life and we have to try and bring people to have respect for it and make this as rare a circumstance as possible
4452882 the game has slowed down a lot now its just about going out and playing football
4452883 the biggest thing for me last year were the hots and sights when the defense was blitzing i didnt really know the protections last year as well as i could have but i have a good grasp on them now
4452884 david is such a hard worker when he is on the field it is all about business he is leading the group of wide receivers and they are making plays everyday
4452885 jimmy is in complete control of the huddle we know that he knows what he is doing so it makes our job easier we know if we get open he will get us the ball
4452886 i prepare everyday like i am the no 1 guy i am literally a play away every play from being in charge of the offense so i prepare like i am the starter i can also help lead the second team guys and make sure they develop
4452887 this is my fourth training camp and i know the offense very well so i am capable of making such calls
4452888 weve experienced a reduction in our orders at that plant
4452889 were going to continue to monitor demand and recall workers as we can
4452890 i was driving back from meigs county tonight and gasoline was 3 75 per gallon
4452891 with the downturn in the economy i think were going to see more of this
4452892 you have to look at this as an area problem rather than a belpre problem
4452893 thirty seven isnt a whole lot but we still dont like it theyre losing their jobs and were losing the income tax
4452894 these are well paying jobs and you have to think that one job there is probably linked to about seven other jobs so if you take 35 multiply that by seven thats a lot of people who could be losing their jobs
4452895 its an outrage that we will sign this document tonight
4452896 a 59 863 bill for a single citizen to make this case when we have recognized that the municipal court has issues with space access and security
4452897 outrageous is an understatement and it is with great reluctance that i will sign this
4452898 this is one of the most difficult times ive been through as mayor
4452899 im glad that this has come to an end now we can get back to working on developing suitable court facilities
4452900 we filed as intervenors to protect the integrity of our ballot initiative and we feel that we havent lost in this case as the appeals court did not order the city to build a new municipal court facility
4452901 i am happy in one way but disappointed in how weve come to this conclusion
4452902 a small group of people have cost this city hundreds of thousands of dollars the crg didnt act very responsibly
4452903 then a few years later we could have had a facility for 2 2 million but that didnt meet their cronies wishes either
4452904 now were looking at more than 4 million to renovate the former ohio bureau of employment services building on third street
4452905 when we initiated the first moratorium the cost of a new courthouse was going to be more than 8 million the second facility would have totaled 4 7 million
4452906 mr huggins not only represented me but also represented the taxpayers by filing briefs in the case on behalf of the council
4452907 you stroll in here an hour late thinking this is like high school and no one cares
4452908 i told you when to be here dont shake your head no at me
4452909 you need to grow up and not call a judge a liar
4452910 already when we made this round it was the biggest thing that had happened to us
4452911 we come from a small village there are more cows there than people and all the farmers even came in from the fields to watch us for an hour even though they have no idea what is beach volleyball i cant imagine what they are doing now
4452912 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4452913 i think they are more challenged today because of all the choice and the short window when they get the spotlight
4452914 youd almost say the olympics is an event beyond sports
4452915 the companies have to make sure that being associated with the olympics is going to help them ring their cash registers
4452916 if michael phelps swims for an eighth gold medal the tv ratings are going to be through the roof
4452917 the price has gotten so high that these decisions go all the way at least to ceo level executives if not to the board
4452918 if youre looking at the olympics in terms of these monster ratings and the stories that are coming out its a pretty attractive place to be
4452919 i think youre going to read probably about some more renewals before these games are over
4452920 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike
4452921 i think its a big blow to the city council which is clearly working for illegal immigrants and has no clear idea about safety and making the city a safer place
4452922 the vague language in the initiative will encourage discrimination and harassment based on skin color spoken language and appearance
4452923 this measure will only divide our community by creating fear and confusion in communities of color but it will also thrust the undocumented immigrant community further into the shadows of our society
4452924 i think they are more challenged today because of all the choice and the short window when they get the spotlight
4452925 youd almost say the olympics is an event beyond sports
4452926 the companies have to make sure that being associated with the olympics is going to help them ring their cash registers

4452930 i think youre going to read probably about some more renewals before these games are over

4452944 dbms research reinforces that executive coaching can generate significant rewards within an organization
4452945 businesses that invest in human capital by effectively leveraging executive coaching to groom talent throughout the enterprise are witnessing a significant impact on both operational excellence and the bottom line
4452946 executive coaching has become an ideal talent management tool for increasing business performance and making a companys best people better
4452947 years ago organizations hired coaches only to support their top tier executives or to fix bad hires these days coaching is viewed as very positive and demonstrates an organizations commitment to the employees success in both current and future roles furthermore coaching is increasingly provided to mid level executives as well

4452957 we are introducing these new timeshare properties in response to unprecedented demand for holiday properties in this area
4452958 if those are not your values if you want a country which has sharia law or a theocratic state then australia is not for you
4452959 id be saying to cleric s who are teaching that there are two laws governing people in australia one the australian law and another islamic law that is false if you cant agree with parliamentary law independent courts democracy and would prefer sharia law and have the opportunity to go to another country which practices it perhaps then thats a better option
4452960 clear off basically people who dont want to be australians and who dont want to live by australian values and understand them well then they can basically clear off
4452961 immigrants not australians must adapt take it or leave it i am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture since the terrorist attacks on bali we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of australians
4452962 however the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the politically correct crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others i am not agai nst immigration nor do i hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to australia
4452963 however there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country and apparently some born here need to understand
4452964 this idea of australia being a multi cultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity and as australians we have our own culture our own society our own language and our own lifestyle
4452965 this culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom
4452966 we speak mainly english not spanish lebanese arabic chinese japanese russian or any other language therefore if you wish to become part of our society learn the language
4452967 most australians believe in god this is not some christian right wing political push but a fact because christian men and women on christian principles founded this nation and this is clearly documented it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools if god offends you then i suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home because god is part of our culture
4452968 we will accept your beliefs and will not question why all we ask is that you accept ours and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us
4452969 if the southern cross offends you or you dont like
4452970 this is our country our land and our lifestyle and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy al l this but once you are done complaining whining and griping about our flag our pledge our christian beliefs or our way of life i highly encourage you take advantage of one other great australian freedom the right to leave
4452971 if you arent happy here then leave we didnt force you to come here you asked to be here so accept the count ry you accepted
4452972 this is a broader social issue that goes beyond the home depot and the solution is certainly more complicated than placing mandates on businesses
4452973 this matter is one that can only be solved by laborers nonprofits government law enforcement neighbors and businesses working together
4452974 it is just by coincidence that i made the oath today god gave me the strength to do it
4452975 by swearing in gods homes that i was sodomised by my employer i challenge anwar ibrahim to swear and to do it in a mosque to deny my allegations
4452976 i would like to emphasise that it happened by force without my permission
4452977 but because we have so many injuries i have to rush him a little bit
4452978 two years ago every company had a story if you didnt like one on earnings then maybe you liked it for its business in china or for its credit card business so everyone was a buy

4452981 it is time to reassess whether stockpiling of antiviral medications makes sense for your layered approach to pandemic preparation so as to minimize the spread of the pandemic and to promote as quick a resumption of operations as possible
4452982 the u s spends twice per capita what other major industrialized countries spend on health care and costs continue to rise faster than income
4452983 we are headed toward 1 of every 5 of national income going toward health care we should expect a better return on this investment

4453027 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4453028 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues

4453051 maar we zijn bereid samen te werken met andere landen om misbruik van het bankgeheim ten behoeve van belastingontduiking tegen te gaan
4453052 we lopen regelmatig bij elkaar binnen drempelvrees ervaren we niet dat is een voordeel als je niet alleen collega maar ook broer van elkaar bent
4453053 onze ouders kregen zes kinderen mijn zus is de oudste daarna komt zwi ik ben de derde mijn broer en ik schelen anderhalf jaar in leeftijd
4453054 aan alles wij konden eerder ivriet klassiek hebreeuws lezen dan nederlands
4453055 vader ging dagelijks naar de synagoge hij las regelmatig voor uit de thora de schriftelijke leer en onderwees ons uit de talmoed de mondelinge leer
4453056 vanaf ons derde jaar nam vader ons elke sjabbat mee naar de sjoel
4453057 met rosj hasjana het joods nieuwjaar blies hij de sjofar tijdens het poerimfeest las hij voor uit de rol van esther moeder zorgde thuis voor de invulling van joodse tradities zij was actief in allerlei joodse soci teiten
4453058 onze ouders hebben ons gestempeld door met name hun levenswandel ze gaven het geloof op natuurlijke wijze aan ons door
4453059 wat zij deden kwam van binnenuit dat zagen wij zoals zij leefden zo wilden wij ook leven
4453060 ik heb het idee dat ik meer aan hem vraag dan hij aan mij vooral na het overlijden van onze vader misschien omdat hij mijn oudere broer is ik vermoed ook dat ik meer steun aan hem heb dan hij aan mij
4453061 hoe ik mijn broer karakteriseer hij is gemakkelijk in de omgang toegankelijk ook mensen zijn blij met hem omdat hij heel dicht bij hen kan staan ik loop ook snel bij hem binnen om advies dat is het voordeel als je niet alleen als collega maar ook als broer samenwerkt
4453062 wat hij van mij zegt zeg ik van hem hij staat graag open voor anderen dat persoonlijke dat warme dat hebben we van onze ouders zij hielden ons altijd voor niet allereerst aan onszelf te denken maar ruimte te bieden aan anderen
4453063 ik kan me nog herinneren dat mijn broer bij het overlijden van onze vader iemand anders sterkte toewenste terwijl hij zelf in rouw verkeerde had hij toch oog voor de ander hij was niet alleen ontvanger maar bleef ook gever dat vond ik heel bijzonder het laat wat mij betreft zien dat hij zichzelf kan wegcijferen
4453064 misschien zet ik mezelf te veel op de achtergrond dat weet ik niet ik maak er geen punt van maar ik vergeet mezelf echt niet hoor
4453065 het valt me op dat je over jezelf zo bescheiden spreekt je bent bescheidener dan ik
4453066 daar zouden we een strijd over kunnen voeren ik denk dat je ongelijk hebt
4453067 mijn vader kwam regelmatig bij rebbe m m schneerson in new york een joods wereldleider die in 1994 is overleden maar wiens dynamische kracht voortgaat in afgezanten die in meer dan zeventig landen ter wereld wonen als kind zijn we enkele keren bij hem op bezoek geweest vanwege zijn wijsheid maakte hij een onuitwisbare indruk op ons beiden na jesjiva het talmoedonderwijs was het voor mij min of meer vanzelfsprekend rabbijn te worden ik wilde iets doen aan de versterking van het jodendom waar ook ter wereld uiteindelijk viel mijn keuze op nederland
4453068 voor mij was het minder snel duidelijk dat ik rabbijn zou worden ik ben nooit iemand geweest die graag op de voorgrond staat toen ik ongeveer 16 jaar was raakte ik bovendien gefascineerd door de informatica commodore 64 een van de eerste thuiscomputers maakte veel indruk op mij net als mijn broer raakte ik sterk ge nspireerd door rabbijn schneerson tijdens vakanties van de talmoed hogeschool stuurde hij ons naar verre oorden om joden te bezoeken en ondersteuning te bieden toen ik merkte hoezeer mensen de ontmoetingen op prijs stelden dacht ik misschien is het rabbinale werk toch iets voor mij
4453069 rabbi schneerson heeft ons als geen ander duidelijk gemaakt dat de mitswot de 613 voorschriften laagdrempelig zijn de thora is er niet alleen voor de allerbeste en meest vergevorderde joodse mensen nee de bedoeling is dat iedereen ermee overweg kan
4453070 de rebbe heeft laten zien hoe toegankelijk het jodendom is joodse mensen die in meerdere of mindere mate een seculier leven leiden willen wij laten zien hoe goed de bijbelse wetten zijn je m t ze niet doen je m g ze doen
4453071 die laatste opmerking vind ik een beetje gewaagd ik zou zeggen k moet het doen maar ik kan tegen de ander niet zeggen jij moet het ook doen wel kun je uitleggen hoe iedereen de thora kan naleven
4453072 ik bedoel dit er wordt van ons verwacht dat wij alle wetten houden dat is ook wat ik predik maar mensen moeten het naleven van de wetten niet zien als een last maar als een voorrecht
4453073 dat gevoel dat u op grote verzoendag hebt dat heb ik ook op zaterdag
4453074 om mensen te laten ervaren hoe het is om sjabbat in het gezin te vieren stellen wij ons huis op die dag graag voor anderen open dan proeven ze de sfeer de gezelligheid de liefde
4453075 ik denk van wel we hebben een verschrikkelijke tijd achter de rug 1940 1945 nog altijd zijn er mensen die wel bij mij op bezoek willen komen maar mij uit vrees voor hun buren liever niet bij hen thuis ontvangen in de jaren zestig aarzelden mensen hun kinderen naar joodse scholen te sturen zij hadden niet de verwachting dat er over vijftig jaar nog iets van het jodendom te zien zou zijn misschien alleen nog in amsterdam zij kregen geen gelijk alleen al in haarlem heb ik op zondag dertig kinderen op de joodse leerschool
4453076 wat voor haarlem geldt geldt ook voor andere plaatsen meer mensen trekken naar de leerscholen meer mensen hebben belangstelling voor allerlei activiteiten dat is mede te danken aan degenen die zich na de oorlog op intense wijze hebben ingezet voor het jodendom tegelijk is er ook een verband met de toenemende aandacht voor spiritualiteit nogal wat joden komen via omwegen terug bij het jodendom
4453077 voor ons is het daarom belangrijk te laten zien wat we in huis hebben
4453078 wij voeden onze kinderen beschermd op ze gaan naar joodse scholen ze zijn lid van joodse verenigingen de veranderingen in de samenleving vragen daarom als ik op straat loop en aan de overkant loopt een hippie met mooie gekleurde haren dan kijken de mensen niet naar hem maar naar m j sjonge wat is die man ouderwets dat was dertig jaar geleden anders
4453079 de kinderen worden indringender geconfronteerd met wat er op straat gebeurt dat vraagt om een stabiele opvoeding daarom is het zo belangrijk dat man en vrouw over allerlei kwesties samen nadenken en een eensgezind standpunt innemen eten we koosjer vieren we de sjabbat dat zorgt voor balans in je gezin
4453080 om die reden gaan we ook behoedzaam om met moderne media tv houden we buiten de deur internet gebruiken we alleen gefilterd
4453081 onze kinderen begrijpen dat geen van hen heeft ooit om een tv gevraagd ze weten dat er een heleboel troep op komt waarmee ze niet willen worden ge dentificeerd
4453082 de tijd die we tegemoet gaan is de tijd van masjiach messias de verlosser
4453083 we hebben het gevoel dat hij elk moment kan komen
4453084 ja maar als laatste we wachten eerst tot de anderen in isra l zijn
4453085 zo is het we willen weg en we zullen er komen liefst zo spoedig mogelijk maar we doen als een kapitein we stappen pas van het schip als alle anderen behouden zijn

4453300 readily accessible information is a key to reducing the uncertainty around entry to land
4453301 we anticipate many of the issues can be resolved in this forum however in the meantime this online information may be helpful for landholders
4453302 specific requirements are in place to assure there is a lessening or even a removal of potential for damage in future storms
4453303 there are many approaches to mitigating a storm damaged structure
4453304 they include elevation and relocation of properties or simple things such as raising hot water heaters washers and dryers among other things
4453305 we urge all rebuilding contractors and property owners to visit their local permitting offices and obtain the necessary permits before beginning the rebuilding process
4453306 prior planning and good information will produce a structure that would be better able to withstand the next major disaster and will keep the property owner from having to undergo the costly process of getting the proper permits
4453307 this conference enhances the professional development of health and physical education teachers and encourages them to take the lead in helping children become more active
4453308 the healthy kids queensland nutrition and physical activity survey indicates more than one in five queensland children is overweight or obese which is a great concern to us all
4453309 the level of physical inactivity of queensland adults is also worrying those meeting the recommended physical activity levels required for health benefits declined from 49 4 per cent in 1997 to 40 2 per cent in 2004
4453310 our government is committed to supporting and promoting the health and well being of queenslands young people and adults
4453311 i have nominated 2008 as the year of physical activity to highlight the governments smart moves physical activity programs in queensland state schools which increases physical activity as part of the school curriculum
4453312 engaging in physical activity at school improves students educational outcomes supports their personal development and helps promote lifelong active lifestyles
4453313 we encourage all queenslanders to take responsibility for their own health and that of their communities and guide and inspire children to enjoy healthy lives
4453314 health and physical education teachers are helping to lead the way towards a healthier queensland
4453315 todays action forum has put the spotlight on the national failure of our infrastructure policy
4453316 its a failure that has two fundamental causes the federal government is not investing enough in our infrastructure and when it does its not investing wisely if america is going to remain the worlds economic superpower this must change
4453317 the american society of civil engineers grades our nations infrastructure at a d requiring a 1 6 trillion investment just to fix it a bridge collapses in minneapolis steam pipes explode in manhattan levies burst in new orleans these are not isolated incidents they are symptoms of an underfunded national infrastructure
4453318 like a mechanic who forgets to wipe his hands on a shop rag and then goes home hugs his wife and gets a grease stain on her favorite sweater love touches you and marks you forever
4453319 this is about kick starting the search for more geothermal energy and the bligh government is backing it all the way
4453320 queensland is best placed to capitalise on geothermal energy were home to most of australias hot rocks
4453321 geothermal energy has no dangerous greenhouse gas emissions its an ideal energy source to help us tackle climate change
4453322 its in keeping with our smart energy policy to source more electricity generation from renewable energy sources
4453323 im excited about the prospects of new geothermal discoveries initial estimates show that the hot dry rocks beneath the eromanga and cooper basins could meet all of australias energy needs for many years into the future
4453324 the geothermal industry has a bright future in queensland because it has the potential to produce more base load energy than any other renewable energy source
4453325 10 companies have been notified that their applications over 27 of the areas released for exploration can progress towards grant
4453326 in may we granted the first ever exploration permit for geothermal energy exploration in queensland to granite power ltd
4453327 two other companies have begun the native title process the final step before the granting of their exploration permits
4453328 were injecting 15 million over 5 years in our geothermal centre of excellence in comparison western australia is spending 2 3 million and south australia 250 000
4453329 we want to create a strong and dynamic hot rocks industry in queensland one that explorers can invest in with certainty and confidence

4453337 ik begin de voorstelling meteen met een lied een vrouw in dit land mag alleen niet solo zingen dus een mannelijke collega acteur werd gevraagd om mee te neuri n bij de liedjes op die manier was het wel toegestaan het was best hilarisch om opeens iemand mee te horen neuri n op de achtergrond
4453338 ze hadden ook kritiek over de aanrakingen op een gegeven moment komen de armen van mijn zoon max om mij heen de armen van de pop zijn ook de armen van een mannelijke acteur die achter de pop staat dat mag niet mannen mogen vrouwen niet in het openbaar aanraken ik heb dat opgelost door mijn eigen armen om me heen te slaan
4453339 we merkten dat het publiek niet tussendoor klapt en zich niet uit we dachten eerst o jee ze vinden het misschien niet leuk maar achteraf kregen we hele enthousiaste reacties tijdens de voorstelling kijken en luisteren ze gewoon
4453340 the money is vital to the ongoing reliability and safety of these roads in rural and regional queensland
4453341 building and maintaining roads in rural and remote conditions can present particular challenges particularly after rain or during droughts
4453342 the funding provided in this contract will help address these challenges and essentially prolong the life of the roads by reducing deterioration
4453343 it makes sense to give these maintenance contracts to the shires as they have locally based people equipment and materials available to them
4453344 having local staff with the skills expertise and knowledge to maintain these roads in their own area also helps keep these skills in the local community as well as providing the best value for the departments funding
4453345 local people working on local roads are a key factor in our success in keeping the road network maintained within the budget available
4453346 this is a fantastic achievement for travis and will enhance his knowledge and experience as well as his future career in the ict industry
4453347 the aiia has been working closely with the queensland government to develop skills as part of the queensland government ict career graduate development program
4453348 i am informed that the quality of work demonstrated by the graduates in the program has been exceptional as has their commitment to developing their skills further
4453349 the aiia is pleased to award a world study tour to travis to further develop his skills in ict by being able to visit member organisations around the world
4453350 it is a great opportunity for me to better understand the global nature of the ict industry and i am delighted to represent queensland
4453351 these projects form part of the councils townsville and thuringowa water supply upgrade project
4453352 an amount of 25 58 million has been committed to the mt spec plant upgrade which involves the construction of a new 40ml per day water treatment plant on elevated land at kinduro north of hencamp creek
4453353 this new facility will ensure water from the crystal creek intake paluma dam system conforms to water quality targets and provides a reliable high quality water source for the local community
4453354 the queensland government also has committed 7 72 million to upgrade the treatment modules at douglas so the facility can better cope with the high level of treated water needed to be produced
4453355 this is essential infrastructure for our communities and the government is pleased to provide these funds through the water and sewerage program to help make these upgrades possible
4453356 obviously queensland is not contributing to the overall reduction in public housing dwellings in australia
4453357 in fact if it wasnt for the queensland governments strong commitment to providing social housing then the national drop in public housing would have been much larger
4453358 this years budget included more than 1 billion for housing with 759 million of that being spent to build and buy more social housing dwellings across the state
4453359 the previous coalition government spent only 330 million on housing in its last year in office and over this year the labor government will more than triple the spend on social housing
4453360 there is unprecedented demand for social housing because of record low housing affordability in the private rental market
4453361 across queensland the median weekly rent for a two bedroom unit has leapt 66 in the past five years 175pw to 290 while the cost of a three bedroom unit has jumped 58 300 315pw
4453362 this has forced more and more people to abandon the private rental market and apply for social housing
4453363 in recognition of this demand the department of housing has moved to ensure its stock of housing is being used to house those in greatest need while developing new initiatives like rentconnect to help those who can access the private market
4453364 it is also looking at new and innovative ways to boost the supply of housing such as purchasing and renovating former motels which have the potential to add to the stock faster and for less capital outlay

4453371 there were enormous complexities and there are some loose ends that we have not nailed down we have figured out most of the solutions however
4453372 weve made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping from some of our distribution centers today and will continue to work though the night to have shipments available to run all distribution centers tomorrow
4453373 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4453374 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4453375 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing

4453389 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim

4453395 i was happy to not spend too much time on the court
4453396 my arm gets really tired and i cant practice as much
4453397 i played some balls deep into the corners and down the middle and she didnt have a chance to step up and play her game
4453398 in the first set she made a lot of unforced errors
4453399 i think we both were a little nervous i dont think we both played our best in the second set she was more aggressive and played a lot of long points when i was down 3 0 and 4 1 it was only one break so i didnt panic because i knew with one break im back in it
4453400 early this year i spent a few days in valencia with my family between the rollout and the next test we had a great time went to the beach and in town there s a dried out riverbed that has nature parks and playgrounds that was very nice especially for the children valencia is also a great place for shopping and eating out needless to say and i love the contrast between its historic and futuristic architecture i am looking forward to the weekend
4453401 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
4453402 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
4453403 the short summer break after the race in budapest has benefited everyone
4453404 the european grand prix around the port area of valencia is new to the programme this year we are very much looking forward to the race and the city particularly as bmw has some close associations with valencia the formula bmw racing center there serves as the training site for our up and coming young talent in the formula bmw series around the world valencia is by tradition the venue for rolling out our new f1 car and beyond that city races always make for a unique atmosphere we await the new circuit with keen anticipation
4453405 valencia is a new venue in the calendar and as such poses a particular challenge not least because it s a street circuit
4453406 if you compare valencia with monaco you re talking about two street circuits but with very distinctive characters and very different challenges for the cars in valencia we will be racing with a lot of downforce but not with the maximum that monaco demands

4453425 when i was 13 years old i escaped through the roofs and i jumped over the walls slipping away from the repressive police of that time
4453426 we used to arrange clandestine meetings in cellars inner patios and family houses fearing that the repressive forces would come at any moment we distributed pamphlets painted murals on the walls of the streets and we slipped into schools and universities to make denunciations and we had to do it quickly to erase all traces as soon as possible

4453458 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4453459 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
4453460 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4453461 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4453462 these contributed to a heightened sense of risk and strengthened the genuine suspicion that the persons identified were in fact a threat to the tank and its crew
4453463 the tank crews superiors asked to authorize firing by the tank reasonably concluded that the characters identified by the tank were hostile and posed a threat to the tank and its crew

4453500 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4453501 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4453502 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4453503 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4453504 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4453505 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this

4453512 we have selected a very strong starting team but there are a number of youngsters that will be seen either in the starting line up or from the bench
4453513 well i dont know all the words to that song but ill say this were very excited just in the fact that we feel we improved off last weeks performance
4453514 it almost wasnt really a surprise because you see him do it in practice and he came out and had such a command over the offense
4453515 as comfortable as you can feel with two days of practice i think some good things happened though
4453516 he sat there and just smiled and we laughed about it but those things happen
4453517 i think it was a nice start for him well see where it goes

4453537 i know lambert is a ground and pound guy and so am i so it has the potential to be an all out war on the ground i have been working hard on my ground for this fight and i want to show off my submission skills he is not scared to stand with guys and if he tries to avoid my takedowns and keep it standing then i have no problem ending it on the feet

4453546 given our home price expectations for the remainder of this year we expect 2 7 million pre foreclosure and foreclosure filings in 2008 up nearly 50 from 2007
4453547 home prices take years to stabilize in a down cycle but seeing the rate of decrease slow after a year and a half is about in line with what id expect

4453550 we just could not figure out what roger was doing in the court he proved why he is among the all time greats
4453551 it was a heartbreak for us weve played together so long and it olympic medal was the only thing missing in our showcase we came to it on a couple of occasions and had half chances too but in the end we could not do it
4453552 probably you cannot do much when you have the best player in the world on the other side of the net and with him a player who does not miss anything it was unbelievable the way federer came out blazing all guns it seems they have consulted someone who knows our game very well especially the way they were serving
4453553 it was very disappointing we came here as prepared as we could have and played quality tennis in the last two rounds too bad we could not do it that too on our independence day

4453564 that will linebacker is in space a little more and gives him the freedom to run
4453565 i started enjoying the middle and i started picking it up and thats why i was kind of a little upset about this switch because right when i started getting good at it i moved to another position
4453566 but the upside to it is that when im out there i kind of know what everybody has to do now just from playing mike sam and will so i can kind of help other people
4453567 i think thats because one im a team player and i want the team to win
4453568 but there are times where i felt are they moving me because im versatile and i can do this or are they moving me because they think someone can play the position better than me
4453569 some of those things go through your head but as long as every position i play im successful at i dont mind
4453570 because not a lot of guys can move around and still lead the team in tackles play at a high level and make a lot of plays d j s done that and he hasnt complained one bit
4453571 for myself its taken me years to learn my position learn routes and d j once he learns one position hes switching to the next hes done a tremendous job
4453572 i heard what kind of guy al wilson was when he was here we came out together and i played with him at the pro bowl and i know what kind of loss it was to the team when he left
4453573 i really feel like d j s doing a great job filling his shoes and becoming the leader he needs to be for this football team to take off
4453574 if the numbers are right and things are good i would love to stay here

4453585 i always took my training and fighting seriously but i never looked at this as a career
4453586 i couldnt have trained harder for that fight but i learned a lesson i learned that no matter how hard i worked at it it was time to take this sport even more seriously
4453587 i just want to fight so i can put all doubts to rest about what happened last time it bothered me a little for a little while that people thought our last fight was a fluke and i was lucky to win
4453588 it may take longer but i am confident the result will be the same and that i will win again

4453597 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
4453598 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning

4453627 when you have high growth rates it leads to supply side stress
4453628 on the other hand a large part of this inflation is imported
4453629 for imported inflation theres little you can do other than subsidize
4453630 the issue is how quickly they can push these things through parliament
4453631 that will lead to further inflation if there were no subsidies the real inflation what would it be

4453635 the cold war is over called on russian leaders today to reconsider their actions in georgia a former soviet satellite that has turned democratic
4453636 damaged its credibility the president said accusing the russians of
4453637 unfortunately russia has tended to view the spread of freedom and democracy as opposed to its interests bush said today in a statement outside the oval office before heading to his texas ranch for vacation
4453638 a future of cooperation and peace will benefit all parties bush said
4453639 the cold war is over the days of satellites and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4453640 she will bring me up to date on what she has seen and heard in georgia as well as paris said bush
4453641 some americans listening today may wonder why events taking place in a small country half way around the world matter to the united states bush said
4453642 georgia has become a democracy since the rose revolution the georgian people have held free elections georgia has sent troops to afghanistan and iraq to help others achieve the liberty they have obtained
4453643 in rural areas like nicollet brown and waseca counties emergency response is very fuel intensive and expensive we cannot continue to expect local firefighters to absorb the costs of increasing gas and diesel
4453644 our first responders are better off spending their time on training and emergency preparedness than on additional fundraising to cover skyrocketing the cost of fuel thats why i support the saves act which helps volunteer fire companies pay for the fuel to run their trucks
4453645 we have no choice but to pull it from somewhere else in the budget
4453646 the additional funding from this bill will help offset the rising costs of petroleum which is something we have no control over fuel is something we cant cut corners on we must respond to emergencies despite the drastic increases in price

4453651 two very simple reasons why litigation costs have spiraled out of control
4453652 corporate counsel often hire expensive big name law firms for the political cover it provides them in the event the ultimate disposition of the litigation is unsatisfactory
4453653 most corporations could cut their litigation costs in half without adversely impacting the outcome of any of their litigation matters

4453660 irans talk of destroying israel must not be lost in translation
4453661 the dpa will in the future pay attention in reporting to the fact that irans president mahmud ahmadinejad did not demand the destruction of israel or its being wiped off the map
4453662 this sentence which irans president actually formulated is according to international law a fully correct demand a few weeks ago the catholic bishops expressed themselves even more drastically about israels ghetto policies
4453663 the zionists accuse us of preparations for a possible attack but that is a lie the iranian nation has never in her history attacked anyone
4453664 do you not think that this position contributes in any way towards iran being isolated from the international community
4453665 what i said about the zionist regime was above all an announcement what i announced was that this regime will soon dissolve and collapse
4453666 the influence of the zionists on the western and european states unfortunately causes such tumult and then they also exploit the opportunity to link it up to an atom energy problem that ignoramus who said this for the first time has not understood at all that the atom weapon is not fit for eliminating governments and systems and regimes systems and regimes do not disappear with the help of the atom weapon the atom weapon can only destroy people and swathes of land
4453667 the zionist regime which is a usurpational and illegal regime and a cancerous growth has to be wiped off the map
4453668 the zionist regime is moving towards its absolute end the corrupt element will be wiped off the map
4453669 oh dear imam khomeini you had once deigned to say
4453670 there are no doubts the new wave of attacks in palestine will blot out the stigma in the visage of the islamic world
4453671 i do not doubt that the new wave which has begun in beloved palestine and which we see today in the islamic world is a wave of morals it has grasped the whole islamic world and will very soon eliminate the blot from the lap of the islamic world
4453672 the iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad has threatened the state of israel with destruction
4453673 as the soviet union disappeared the zionist regime will also vanish and humanity will be liberated
4453674 ahmadinejad israel will be annihilated as once the soviet union
4453675 that this jerusalem occupying regime must be erased from the page of time
4453676 our dear imam khomeini deigned to say the regime occupying jerusalem must vanish from the annals of history
4453677 with his statement that he wanted to wipe israel off the map
4453678 irans president mahmud ahmadinejad provides again and again for sensation through his israel hostile and anti semitic statements
4453679 this is a short phase when we shall have successfully put it behind us then god willing the process of disappearance of the regime occupying al qods the holy jerusalem and the setting up of the national government of palestine will be a smooth and simple one
4453680 atomic holocaust that party which is actually threatened by an atomic attack is meant to be put forward as the perpetrator that is what it is all about
4453681 irans talk of destroying israel must not be lost in translation
4453682 the iranian leaders in their own words about the annihilation of israel a plea against apologetic campaigns to exculpate the call for genocide
4453683 what iranian leaders really say about doing away with israel a refutation of the campaign to excuse ahmadinejads incitement to genocide
4453684 wipe off the map irans president demands the destruction of israel
4453685 the zionist regime is a decaying and crumbling tree that will fall with a storm
4453686 just as the soviet union disappeared the zionist regime will also vanish and humanity will be liberated
4453687 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4453688 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4453689 may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4453690 this discontinuity the war i mean has made a nomad out of me
4453691 we have a long standing history with the norwegian kings guard and it is something we are extremely proud of
4453692 its an honour that they take the time to visit us and we are all looking forward to welcoming them on friday
4453693 edinburgh zoo is famous for its king penguins and nils olav is definitely the most famous of them all
4453694 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4453695 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
4453696 were all very excited about his new promotion and weve all been wondering what it could be

4453700 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4453701 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4453702 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4453703 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4453704 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4453705 down by an average of 1 37 per barrel per session
4453706 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4453707 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil
4453708 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4453709 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4453710 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4453711 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4453712 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4453713 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4453714 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4453715 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4453716 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4453717 musharraf has been seeking safe passage for a long time but we oppose it the man who subverted the constitution must be impeached and tried we want to set an example for the future
4453718 but we cannot block safe passage to musharraf because we are not at the helm of affairs
4453719 the motion for musharrafs impeachment would be introduced in the national assembly on monday
4453720 we have also heard reports that musharraf would resign before the impeachment process is started however we have been instructed to proceed on the assumption that he will fight the impeachment

4453723 sen feinstein is in position right now in the senate shes chair of the rules committee it would be hard to see her walk away from that because shes certainly a respected leader in our country
4453724 its going to bring down the price at the pump
4453725 even the president has said it isnt a quick fix i cant allow a hoax to come to the floor
4453726 in the context of a fuller more comprehensive energy package
4453727 not pass their royalties to the taxpayer they want us to subsidize the drilling
4453728 there was sexism but that plays a couple of ways being a woman in politics is a giant plus
4453729 theres all kinds of analysis of how their campaign prioritized the races
4453730 made a big difference in giving him the opportunity that he had it was a factor that was important
4453731 they want the war to end and im with them on that
4453732 ora s che viviamo il clima dellolimpiade tutti gli atleti sono sullo stesso piano che emozione
4453733 stai a contatto con le stelle degli altri sport continua montolivo e vedi sfilare campioni di tutto il mondo ho incontrato gasol e nowitzki per uno come me che ama il basket unemozione
4453734 with the people of georgia and their democratic elected government
4453735 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4453736 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4453737 there is a lot going on behind the scenes that is putting pressure on the consumer which makes him turn to his credit cards for instance unemploment is at a four year high statistics show that when you lose your job typically it will take you one month of job search to replace each 10 000 in lost income
4453738 if a person loses a 50 000 a year job it is likely going to take you 5 months to replace that job with that type of income during that interim since americans are great spenders and lousy savers the consumer probably doesnt have any savings to fall back on so he lives off of his credit card
4453739 if to talk to oneself when alone is folly it must be doubly unwise to listen to oneself in the presence of others
4453740 can i say this is the first time ive been on television
4453741 hes sick hes got an addiction he needs treatment hes sick you know there is treatment for this kind of addiction a lot of men have gone through the treatment with a lot of success but he wont do it because he is in denial
4453742 if obama wins he will win by a landslide margin if mccain wins it will be a very small margin
4453743 i think it will be a very positive message and i know that im looking forward to it head coach tim brewster said
4453744 the exciting thing for me is that it seems like hes really trying to make something positive out of this you look at different situations and try to learn from them because thats all you can do
4453745 students teachers security they all harassed me for being gay
4453746 now i can tell people that im in ged class
4453747 if you dont have a high school degree youre going to be working minimum wage jobs for the rest of your life
4453748 its one of those things if you build it they will come
4453749 when society is calling you a bad person sooner or later you start to believe that youre a bad person
4453750 thats the thought process we have to go in and disrupt
4453751 they told me i needed to get out of their house if i wasnt going to at least try to be a heterosexual
4453752 you could be an 82 year old black lady in a wheelchair with one eye and theyre not going to discriminate against you its completely open and i like that
4453753 weve got a lot of marketing to do but its all just a matter of time
4453754 i never thought much about it it just seemed natural to me
4453755 my dad was promoting and training fighters at the time so i just grew up around it
4453756 uncle sam is the oldest member of the usa boxings adirondack association
4453757 it started in a vacant apartment building on 10th street
4453758 i wrapped an old military duffel bag around a steel pole
4453759 well of course im proud of it but im lucky to have had the chance too
4453760 but then came 9 11 and people lost a lot of money
4453761 i was really shocked that he stood there toe to toe and just came at me
4453762 people will stop and tell me hey i saw you and maddalone last night
4453763 i dont know maybe maybe not just last night i got an offer to fight michael grant i gotta think
4453764 but theres a time when every fighter has to make that decision to do it now or not now
4453765 i just loved these sports and had to take the opportunities that were given to me
4453766 i want to turn pro as soon as i can
4453767 t his series of rulings does indeed provoke some uneasy questions
4453768 we want parents to have the freedom to homeschool but we dont want children to become captives in a homeschool that doesnt prepare them for work or civic engagement as a functioning adult
4453769 hopefully a way to monitor progress rather than an adversarial reality will be an outgrowth of this decision
4453770 the best interest of the child is secured when the state protects a parents unalienable right from civil regulation and unwanted private interference whether philanthropic or otherwise
4453771 most of us dont live in brazil so we cant eat freshly picked acai and since the fruit is highly perishable it cant be transported to other countries in fresh form so the only real options are freezing the skin and pulp or freeze drying it we think freeze dried acai is the best for a number of reasons
4453772 freeze dried acai and specifically our favorite acai supplement called perfect acai is as close as most people will get to eating fresh acai berries from the amazon rainforest in brazil
4453773 the reason the perfect acai product is our favorite and our customers favorite is because this product is the purest acai supplement on the market its the most potent since its 100 pure organic acai it is also priced the best by far
4453774 perfect acai is the perfect acai product because it fits all of our essential criteria for selecting a quality acai product which includes potency purity and price
4453775 an informed acai berry consumer is our best customer whenever you have an exciting new product like this and the ensuing hype the inevitable health food imposters will start to appear and that has already begun
4453776 i looked into mr putins eyes and i saw three things a k and a g and a b
4453777 we cannot run society for the privileged and allow a significant proportion of the population to be marginalized it impacts the quality of life for all of us if we have throwaway people a justice system which tolerates injustice is doomed to collapse i am truly ready for action
4453778 amy has been on several of my television shows in the united kingdom shes a very talented and beautiful girl and in my house to this day i have a mexican doll that for a while lived in her hair
4453779 it sort of looks like 10 metre boulders came flying out of the sky i dont know how you get them on top of ridges
4453780 it would be a big deal because it would mean the jets are at pretty high pressure and high pressure means high temperatures well above the boiling point of water on earth
4453781 the big thing thats going to be useful out of all this is its application to molecular epidemiology
4453782 if the same thing happens in a year i would expect to see hundreds of salmonella genomes sequenced
4453783 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
4453784 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
4453785 im sitting in a hotel room in germany in the middle of my summer tour with the tv news telling me that my is being torn to pieces
4453786 throughout this week i havent been able to stop watching the news ive never seen it like this before its never made me feel so naked isolated and angry
4453787 with the russians still being in gori there are reports that they have stopped fighting but you dont need to be killing a countrys people or its soldiers to paralyse it
4453788 you see gori is right in the middle of the only road that goes from west to east across georgia
4453789 its the road that my mum and brother need to travel on to catch their return flight out of tbilisi
4453790 georgia has always had shaky politics especially after the break up of the and the civil war that followed in the 90s
4453791 more recently things appeared to be getting better the economy was growing the major cities were starting to look cleaner electricity blackouts like the ones when i lived there were almost unheard of
4453792 a console version is something thats being considered right now but currently its not confirmed
4453793 dude what is it you and your two friends working out of your moms garage doing this crap
4453794 i do a perimeter check once an hour i just say that i need some alone time to ponder the whole veronica thing works like a charm
4453795 ive got an appointment to look at a townhouse looks right into a yoga studio
4453796 youre whats wrong with our country pal oohah oohah oohah whats going on there
4453797 wait a minute first of all what do you listen to oldtimer
4453798 barbara mandrell nothing wrong with that kenny g captain and tenille
4453799 whoa thats like too gangster for me right there man
4453800 we believe this campaign is a huge positive step towards fixing some of the major issues facing our employers
4453801 every day we read negative stories about careers in bars hotels restaurants and tourism businesses we have been able to pull together some of the biggest names in our sector to attempt to reverse this trend
4453802 we see this campaign as a vital part of our sectors attempts to bring the brightest and best talent into our industries as we begin the task of preparing for 2012
4453803 what is a subsidy is in some ways in the eye of the beholder
4453804 clearly the city and the state contribute a significant amount of money to the mta but over 1 billion just seemed high to us
4453805 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4453806 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4453807 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4453808 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4453809 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
4453810 the future of the internet and how to stop it
4453811 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4453812 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4453813 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4453814 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4453815 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4453816 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4453817 suffered from stuttering every 15 seconds or so at 24 hz display refresh rate on blu ray and the issue is still there on g45 centrino 2
4453818 i skipped everything regarding gaming its not and never will be my focus
4453819 the surprise was not so much that the next move in rates is likely to be down that has been our forecast for some time but that the central bank seems happy to nurture this expectation
4453820 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4453821 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4453822 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4453823 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4453824 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4453825 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4453826 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4453827 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4453828 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4453829 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4453830 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4453831 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4453832 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4453833 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4453834 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4453835 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4453836 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4453837 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon
4453838 its important for the peace and security of the region its important for peace and security internationally
4453839 his contribution to the team both through his results and his courage in the face of illness are an inspiration he will be missed enormously and the immediate thoughts of the whole team are with his family
4453840 book is a compilation of all the innuendo and false rumors against obama that he was raised a muslim attended a radical black church and secretly has a
4453841 in fact obama is a christian who attended trinity united church of christ in chicago
4453842 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4453843 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
4453844 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
4453845 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
4453846 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
4453847 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
4453848 the scientific community is really going to run with this
4453849 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

4453860 the next generation srx is the result of the continued exploration and refining of cadillac design language with the goal of creating dramatic presence in the luxury crossover space
4453861 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4453862 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4453863 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4453864 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4453865 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4453866 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4453867 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4453868 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4453886 said pinnick in a phone interview with the tribune from his home in houston
4453887 its kind of like looking at a yearbook and you kind of go ok if i was a little smarter and wiser i might have done this a little differently
4453888 this one for some reason i just couldnt deal with it and i thought oh man its not the way that i wanted it and theres all these things wrong
4453889 i asked one of them how they put it together and he told me
4453890 they found the decomposing bodies of a family of bigfoot creatures at the base of a cliff
4453891 apparently the family was standing on the cliffs edge when it gave way and they all fell to their deaths the bigfoot bodies were in various states of decay but the men managed to collect enough good pieces from the five bigfoot creatures to assemble one complete specimen so what they are passing off as a bigfoot creature is actually a composite made up of five different specimens so the whole thing is a complete fraud

4453943 this is not a tree hugger thing at all we present this stuff in a real mainstream lights i think one of the problems in trying to educate people is that a lot of scare tactics have been used were really trying to create a celebration of a new way of life and were doing it in a non preachy non didactic way

4453996 they dont understand ill find you gold in five minutes
4453997 oh yeah people still get the fever so bad man they can taste it
4453998 first you want to shake it around with lots of water
4453999 the gold is 19 times heavier than water and it all sinks to the bottom you mostly find really fine flour gold around here

4454012 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4454013 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4454014 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4454016 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4454019 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4454020 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4454021 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4454022 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4454023 sekiranya dia benar dia akan selamat tetapi jika dia berbohong lambat laun kelaknatan allah akan turun kepadanya dalam berbagai perkara yang tidak tergambar oleh dirinya sendiri
4454024 keberanian saiful melafazkan lafaz yang seperti itu menunjukkan samada dia meyakini apa yang dia dakwa ataupun dia tidak faham akan kesan terhadap lafaz berkenaan pada masa hadapan
4454025 bukan mudah seseorang melafazkan sumpah mubahalah itu melainkan dia dalam keadaan tidak siuman ataupun dia sedar apa yang diyakini itu benar
4454026 oleh kerana akan timbul kesangsian pihak yang di cabar dan untuk menghilangkan keraguan masyarakat maka pihak yang didakwa iaitu datuk seri anwar ibrahim hendaklah melafazkan sumpah bermubahalah dengan bentuk yang sama maka jadilah mubahalah yang mana kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti

4454030 its so precious we choose not to pronounce it it represents a deity who is beyond definition
4454031 as a result of your may 15 column yes mayor harris was contacted by the fbi
4454032 they wanted to ask him about the meeting what he was told by the fbi is that they view harris and the village as the victim in this which we think is fundamentally inaccurate the village is not the victim
4454033 hes a businessman and through his business weve been able to get a good price we used to pay 18 for a pair of gymnastic shoes now were paying 10

4454036 its very very difficult on a lot of people it will basically shut down the community for a few days especially around the funeral time
4454037 i was at home this evening and one of my sister in laws came in and told me about it it was my niece actually that came upon the accident and had to identify the individuals there and she works for them so it was very tragic for her as well
4454038 we cant really determine what the cause of the collision is at this time
4454039 our reconstructionist is on the scene and hes gathering all the information that he can so that we can try and make a determination as to what happened
4454040 were going to wait and find out what any autopsy or investigation can tell us
4454041 one stopped and actually went into the dugout and pulled one of the victims out of the car and brought him to shore

4454043 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4454044 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4454045 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4454046 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4454047 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4454048 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4454049 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4454050 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4454051 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4454052 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4454053 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4454054 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4454055 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4454056 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4454057 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4454058 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4454059 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4454060 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4454061 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4454062 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4454063 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4454064 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4454065 deep and wide why new clearwires spectrum holdings give wimax a boost in the u s wireless market 4g deployment race
4454066 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4454067 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4454068 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4454069 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4454070 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4454071 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4454072 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4454073 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4454074 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4454075 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4454076 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4454077 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4454078 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4454079 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4454080 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4454081 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4454082 i watch to try to see the details of the strokes and see if theres anything i might at my puny level try to imitate
4454083 i especially watch when they show them from underwater so you can really see how their bodies move
4454084 how much are they twisting their bodies side to side are they twisting their hips too how do their kicks coordinate with their arm stroking
4454085 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4454086 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4454087 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4454088 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4454089 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4454090 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4454091 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4454092 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4454093 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4454094 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4454095 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4454096 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4454097 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4454098 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4454099 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4454100 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

4454120 while most people now see ralph reed as a tainted man raising tainted money john mccain sees him as a source of campaign cash
4454121 on the campaign trail john mccain claims that he fought to expose jack abramoff and his corrupt cronies
4454122 it was a scandal that rocked the country linking all the way to the bush white house and republicans in congress sending two former republican congressmen to prison
4454123 but now desperate to raise campaign cash to run more negative attack ads john mccain is cozying up to jack abramoffs cronies
4454124 ralph reed a key business partner of jack abramoff helped the convicted former republican lobbyist launder 2 million dollars through a front group to finance a gambling campaign
4454125 now ralph reed has signed up to raise money for john mccain reed has even been appointed to mccains victory 2008 team
4454126 ralph reeds murky connections to jack abramoff run so deep it cost him a race for lt governor in georgia

4454140 i thought we defended pretty well the first half we knocked the ball around ok the second half we just lost our shape and didnt play the ball around well
4454141 luckily we scrapped well and defended well its just unfortunate to get that penalty in the last couple of minutes
4454142 were a little but frustrated i think we played better in the second half we really put them to the sword and its disappointing we couldnt finish them off

4454255 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
4454256 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4454257 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
4454258 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
4454259 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar

4454261 each condition of metabolic syndrome phenomenon type 2 diabetes and obesity independently raises the risk for erectile dysfunction just on their own
4454262 and so when all are present in combination as part of this syndrome you have a situation where you dont even need to be as diabetic or hypertensive as you might otherwise have to be to experience erectile dysfunction and that fact has been raising concern among clinicians
4454263 statins are used by everyone under the sun and as far as i know theres been no hard evidence that it can be used to treat erectile dysfunction
4454264 on the other hand it may be that it could prevent or modify some of the other for erectile dysfunction
4454265 this is because we do know that an increase in rho kinase leads to heightened tone of the corpus smooth muscle which is one of the causes of erectile dysfunction
4454266 so while i wouldnt go too far with this and i would probably not see statins becoming a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction if these findings turn out to be true then there could perhaps be an additional good use for statins

4454382 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4454383 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes
4454384 tens of thousands are living with the fear of having the home theyve worked so hard for being repossessed by lenders with little compassion
4454385 while we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4454386 for many a repossession order is a wake up call to make them sort out the situation and avoid actually the finality of actually losing their home

4454409 he was taken to the ministry of home affairs and was interrogated briefly authorities said his identity was mixed up with another person called yan naing soe and he was released this morning
4454410 this is the first time that authorities had arrested someone by mistake
4454411 heres the thing we make the bets we make because we know what people need
4454412 in a way we provide outsourced r amp d for the media industry
4454413 playing on the venture side allows us a great look at the future of the business while staying involved in bigger companies allows us a window into what the industry leaders are thinking and looking for
4454414 i think they are more challenged today because of all the choice and the short window when they get the spotlight
4454415 youd almost say the olympics is an event beyond sports
4454416 the companies have to make sure that being associated with the olympics is going to help them ring their cash registers
4454417 if michael phelps swims for an eighth gold medal the tv ratings are going to be through the roof
4454418 the price has gotten so high that these decisions go all the way at least to ceo level executives if not to the board
4454419 if youre looking at the olympics in terms of these monster ratings and the stories that are coming out its a pretty attractive place to be
4454420 i think youre going to read probably about some more renewals before these games are over
4454421 plans to go on his own like elliott yamin and hopes to find distribution any way he can
4454422 says hes recorded eight songs two songs by diane warren most done before the tour started he hopes to get 25 done by thanksgiving and pick 12 for an album set to be released in january or february
4454423 they said look we realize youre 29 years old good luck i was so thankful ive been able to work and get things done instead of wait around
4454424 i want control back its not like i need a label to get me noticed this is one of my last shots to be in this situation
4454425 we will be an option but the fact is newsday still has a very strong franchise they were the only store in town and now were the second store like avis were going to try harder

4454428 theyd yell cut and people would come over with a bathrobe because i was so embarrassed about the flab rolling over
4454429 that and my double chin ive lost the weight but its difficult to get it off as you get older
4454430 our girls are actually older than their u s opponents based on our governments more accurate and efficient method of tracking the passage of time
4454431 we have already had more than twice as many years as the western world and so our gymnasts are double the 12 or 13 years they appear to be by the way most of our girls have put off marriage in order to compete in these olympic games
4454432 pack more time into a year by having fewer seasons
4454433 whereas in the u s you squander your time by having four wasteful seasons
4454434 in china we have optimized our year honing it down to only two seasons the earthquake season and the flood season this way we can do two years in the time it takes americans to do one therefore our girls look like prepubescent pixies while yours look like post menopausal amazons
4454435 we found out a couple of days after the bombings that one of the ladies who worked here was killed on the tavistock square bus
4454436 gladys was such a nice lady always saying hello it was a huge shock for all of us

4454451 there were various nuances and amplifications to the discussion but the more one read the more it appeared clear that god was being presented as a self centered self referential being whose basic motivation for what he does including his motivation for saving people is so that he might receive more glory i suppose we should not be surprised that in a culture and age of narcissism we would recreate god in our own self centered image but it is surprising when we find orthodox christians and even careful scholars doing this
4454452 classical theology has erred in its insistence that theology be god centered not man centered

4454543 i have spoken to the local lodge officials regarding the incident and to the police who are now investigating the attacks this sort of sectarian behaviour must be utterly condemned and those responsible have no place in northern ireland society

4454547 i was deeply upset and hurt by nuala oloan saying that protestants in n ireland grew up being told that they could not trust catholics this was certainly not my experience nor im pretty sure would it have been the experience of the majority of our protestant friends
4454548 all i can say is that i was never aware of anyone being told that catholics couldnt be trusted since hearing this being said by nuala oloan ive mentioned it to a few people locally and theyve all been horrified im sure itll have caused great offence to protestants
4454549 they nazis gave to their children an irrational hatred of jews in the same way that people in northern ireland transmitted to their children an irrational hatred for example of catholics in the same way that people give to their children an outrageous and irrational hatred of those who are of different colour and all of those things

4454551 while undergoing treatment at belfast city hospital i was looking for something to occupy myself as i had too much time on my hands thinking about cancer worrying about my family and the uncertainty of the future
4454552 following a recommendation from a practice nurse i decided to try ucfs art therapy sessions
4454553 i admit that i was anxious when i arrived as i am not an artistic person and i had never done anything like this before
4454554 it was a wonderful experience as it gave me time out for myself the process of creating something even if it wasnt very good helped to clear my mind
4454555 for once i wasnt thinking about cancer or other people and i left the session feeling relaxed and re energized
4454556 cancer can make people feel that they have lost control it can increase feelings of isolation and reduce a persons self esteem
4454557 art therapy enhances coping strategies that involve taking positive steps towards an improved quality of life
4454558 for many cancer patients this can result in a better understanding of their illness and coming to terms with the disease and the future
4454559 it can also act as a distraction for clients providing time for relaxation managing stress and improving mental health and emotional well being

4454562 we are definitely going to miss bakkies hes a special player
4454563 i think bakkies plays in his own way but i will bring my own physical edge to the game
4454564 but im really happy im starting against the all blacks at newlands what more can i ask for
4454565 i see the game as a big challenge especially now with bakkies out
4454566 if i dont step up this weekend i think i will have ruined my chances to start again so its a big one for me
4454567 i think they are a more well rounded side now
4454568 i think they have improved a lot since they lost to australia and of course richie makes a huge difference
4454569 i think fitness is starting to play a big role now under the new laws especially with the quick taps we run more and especially for the locks we have to tackle more
4454570 im quite happy with my fitness weve done a lot of fitness work during the last week
4454571 i think getting praise from guys of that calibre is a good thing but i dont take it too seriously because if i play poorly on the weekend then it all means nothing

4454608 smoke in the atmosphere temporarily reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface

4454622 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
4454623 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation

4454663 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4454664 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4454665 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4454666 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4454667 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4454668 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4454669 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4454670 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4454671 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4454672 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps

4454692 today we got the truly shocking news that inflation hit a 17 year high of 5 6 percent as the prices of gas and groceries continued to soar families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation as weekly earnings adjusted for inflation lie below the level they reached in august 1998 while senator mccain apparently thinks the economy is doing just fine and refuses to support any meaningful short term relief for americas struggling families barack obama has proposed an emergency economic plan that would immediately put 1 000 in the pocket of families to help them pay for gasoline groceries and other necessities in addition the obama plan includes 50 billion in immediate measures to save more than one million jobs from being lost america cannot afford four more years of a policy that puts tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations ahead of the real change americas middle class families need

4454737 in my view there is a methodical progression to the whole process of the feds liquidity moves that is too commonly overlooked start with the standard tools the discount rate and federal funds rate move on to a lengthening of the maturity in the term of those standard tools taf and term repurchase agreements on to a broadening of the collateral used to support monetary policy operations tslf and finally expanding the class of institutions to which the federal reserve will lend pdcf
4454738 to me one of the worlds greatest ironies is that u s dependence on authoritarian governments for financing has soared over the last four year u s rhetoric hasnt matched financial reality though i guess it is equally ironic that russian purchases of treasuries over the past few months have helped to finance the current u s aid mission to georgia one thing is clear the worlds biggest financial powers are no longer the worlds large democracies a gathering of the countries that matter for global economic coordination will no longer be a gathering of the leaders of the worlds big democracies coordination among the large democracies was never easy and likely will only get harder as additional countries have to be brought in and that i suspect this is among the least significant though among the most visible ways the world will change as financial power moves away from the worlds big democracies

4454804 three kids and their mom and dad live in the house that al franken lies about in his television commercial
4454805 while most minnesotans know that a basement bedroom and bathroom is worth 600 a month al franken wants to distract minnesotans from his record of offensive jokes and not paying his taxes perhaps a bit more honesty on the part of the franken campaign and less distortions might be the order of the day

4454809 i dont like that color why are you doing it that way
4454810 im not sure i didnt buy the ticket someone bought it for me
4454811 do you have any copies of the paperwork for the ticket or a confirmation number
4454812 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4454813 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
4454814 its an exciting thing to be a part of we have done a read through of the first three episodes and start filming next week
4454815 i would like to take this opportunity to apologise to him his friends and family for any distortion of public opinion or distress that my comments may have had and i hope this letter serves to go some way to correct that
4454816 the doctor strongly suggested that if i wanted to heal properly i needed to quit
4454817 when you start talking about your face it becomes motivating
4454818 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
4454819 but if they have a medical problem and are not going for just a routine checkup they may tend to listen to that advice more
4454820 with plastic surgery its a little bit different people are desirous of an elective procedure and thats their main objective in coming in its something they truly want
4454821 nicotine causes the tiny blood vessels in the skin to clamp down or constrict which reduces blood supply to the skin
4454822 twenty five years ago it may have been more acceptable for a patient to have undergone surgical procedures while smoking
4454823 nowadays if a doctor knew a patient was smoking and they did flap surgery
4454824 why invest so much money in a cosmetic procedure for enhancement if the patient will not participate and do his or her part to help ensure the best outcome possible
4454825 you can talk to people about quitting smoking but you may not have a months worth of time before you try to save their life with heart surgery
4454826 with the advent of things like chantix we have a much higher success rate
4454827 i want it to look great for you as well as for myself if they smoke even one cigarette i run the risk of it not healing its like trying to water your lawn with a crimped hose
4454828 this is not a prime driver of quitting in america
4454829 these are all adults and im not going to be the person looking over their shoulders
4454830 this was like the first major surgery id had as an adult
4454831 so when my doctor who i respect tells me not to smoke and here are some reasons why then i have to respect that
4454832 they see the wound opening up turning red or black the edges start coming apart
4454833 they see the skin graft we use to put it back together
4454834 i was afraid the anesthesia would go wrong or id wake up coughing my head off and split my guts open

4454845 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4454846 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah

4455041 but people in love can live on love and save money
4455042 the wartime generation was a culture of savers but the boomers were big spenders
4455043 this created a deep deficit and now with no jobs to support the spending well the economy just cant keep going this way
4455044 if all couples were dedicated to putting away just 10 per cent of their salaries in ten years they could go on a very romantic second honeymoon remodel the home and a whole lot more

4455048 this transaction has far reaching economic and transportation benefits to the chicago region the midwest and the nation as well as for cn and its customers
4455049 this transaction enjoys significant support from a broad array of shippers and the range of other parties who have a stake in making sure that the serious rail congestion issues plaguing chicago are being addressed by sound transportation initiatives such as the acquisition by cn of the ej amp e
4455050 at the same time we are well aware of the concerns raised by communities along the ej amp e line about the environmental impacts of increased train traffic we are asking the stb to set a schedule providing for a decision on the merits which if favorable to cn would allow us to close on this transaction before the end of this year but would not cause any adverse environmental impacts before the board completes its environmental review and develops a full record on which to base the environmental mitigation that it may impose on the transaction
4455051 cn is prepared to take the positive step of closing this transaction before year end in a way that provides the stb with additional time to complete its environmental review by early 2009
4455052 we are hopeful that the final eis will conform to the view that this transaction is clearly beneficial to the environment of the broader chicago region and that the legitimate impacts on affected communities are not novel and can all be reasonably mitigated in accordance with sound stb precedents and the long established public policy framework governing railroad transactions throughout the united states
4455053 the chief concerns raised by opponents of this transaction are the impacts of train traffic that will be diverted from cn lines in chicago onto the ej amp e
4455054 our proposal would ensure that the stb has sufficient time to review those matters fully before it authorizes any diversion of traffic
4455055 we have consistently stated that we understand and are willing to address the concerns of communities that will experience train traffic increases as a result of this transaction

4455106 die territoriale integrit t ist eines der grundlegenden v lkerrechts prinzipien niemand lehnt dieses prinzip ab nach dem was geschehen ist werden es osseten und abchasen aber kaum wollen in einem staat mit georgiern zu leben
4455107 als sicherheitsgarant im kaukasus wird russland jene entscheidung akzeptieren die den willen dieser zwei v lker widerspiegeln wird
4455108 in frage k men die olympischen spiele in sotschi die aufnahme russlands in die wto die zugeh rigkeit russlands zur g8 sowie russische unternehmen auf gro en weltm rkten
4455109 falls es gegen seine verpflichtungen zur feuereinstellung in georgien verst t
4455110 all das ist irgendwie nicht sehr ernst in amerika ist die wahlkampagne im gange vorl ufig kann nur die wto als wirklich ernst aufgenommen werden
4455111 wenn die olympischen spiele in sotschi n chstes jahr stattf nden w rde das thema boykott gewiss sofort auf dem ersten platz stehen aber sotschi ist bei uns f r 2014 vorgesehen es wird sich noch etliche pr sidenten abl sen

4455113 viele experten haben eine ganze liste von ma nahmen die russland zum truppenabzug zwingen k nnten sie gehen davon aus dass die f hrung in moskau keinen neuen kalten krieg wolle doch sieht die situation danach aus dass einige von ihnen das doch wohl w nschen
4455114 alles in allem k nnen wir absolut nichts tun um russland zum abzug aus georgien zu zwingen
4455115 um diese neuen richtlinien zu implementieren sollen russisch ukrainische beratungen stattfinden
4455116 dem schwarzmeerflotte vertrag fehlen leider einige erforderliche richtlinien das betrifft unter anderem den einsatz dieser schiffe in konfliktgebieten
4455117 so kann das nicht weiter gehen man muss einen ausweg aus dieser situation finden
4455118 mich beunruhigt die beteiligung der schwarzmeerflotte an kampfhandlungen bzw die seeblockade das ist ein nicht ungef hrlicher pr zedenzfall
4455119 jika anda tanya kami pas maka sudah pasti kami katakan datuk seri abdul hadi adalah orang paling layak untuk memikul tanggungjawab itu
4455120 namun kita dalam pakatan rakyat akan berbincang mengenai siapa yang akan dilantik menjadi perdana menteri
4455121 soal berebut jawatan itu tidak timbul kerana sudah pasti semua komponen pakatan rakyat akan memutuskan individu yang layak menerajui pimpinan negara
4455122 kita seharusnya hanya memikirkan soal itu apabila perkara itu benar benar sudah menjadi kenyataan dan pada masa itu kita akan bincangkannya dengan semangat pakatan rakyat
4455123 dewan pemuda pas tak mahu ada persepsi di kalangan ahli pas bahawa 16 september ini kita perlu tumpu tentang kuasa jawatan dalam politik jawatan menteri itu bukan matlamat kita pada masa ini yang penting kita kukuhkan pr kalau ada masalah kita selesaikan bersama
4455124 ini adalah petanda baik bagi pas dalam usaha untuk memperkukuhkan parti dan merealisasikan nilai islam
4455125 sistem politik begini adalah sangat penting bagi mewujudkan budaya politik yang sihat
4455126 pas akan rugi jika kita menghadapi masalah yang timbul dengan cara yang salah
4455127 saya percaya kita semakin matang setelah diuji dengan pelbagai cabaran untuk terus bersama pakatan rakyat
4455128 kerjasama ini memberi satu pengertian penting untuk pas sebagai contoh semangat kerjasama yang ditunjukkan oleh jentera muktamar kita pada kali ini adalah petanda baik untuk pas perak terus cemerlang bersama kerajaan pakatan rakyat di negeri ini

4455214 when a physician makes the decision to have a patient transferred to a facility outside the province for specialized care financial concern should not be an issue for the patient or their families said ghiz
4455215 our government recognizes that ambulance transfer services to other facilities outside the province should be funded as part of the public health system and we are delivering on our promise to islanders
4455216 is this related to the fact that they will be closing down oleary and alberton hospital emergency rooms because of the shortage of doctors crane asked
4455217 from what i hear a number of doctors are telling patients that they are probably going to have to leave
4455218 until recently patients requiring health care at another facility outside the province were required to pay a portion of the costs said health minister doug currie
4455219 i looked at the public procurement law and it was clear that it did not cover the disposal of immovable assets belonging to the public
4455220 my suggestion of using the privatisation act was countered by my colleagues who appeared uncomfortable
4455221 its a pretty bad year not only for aid workers its a bad year for afghan national police international military forces afghan national army and tragically afghan civilians
4455222 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent canada remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan
4455223 its causing people to become more fearful and for them to lose confidence
4455224 the afghan people have lost any confidence that they had in the international communitys and the afghan governments ability to provide basic security

4455227 such a deal by turkey with iran would send the wrong message at a time when the iranian regime has repeatedly failed to comply with its un security council and iaea obligations
4455228 this is not the time to do business with iran
4455229 it is time for the international community including our ally turkey to begin considering additional measures to pressure iran
4455230 increased tensions between iran and the us will put turkey in a very awkward position
4455231 after the iraq war turkey learned it could no longer remain indifferent to regional developments
4455232 has yet to request that turkey acts as a formal mediator
4455233 this will make any hope of cooperative effort on iran much more difficult
4455234 the last serious issue where the bush administration has decisions to make in terms of changing policy
4455235 the one place of high national security interest to the united states where russia plays a direct role in what we are trying to do in that sense it towers over all these other things
4455236 this has come at a very opportune time for iran
4455237 any new rift between the us and russians would be welcome by iran anything that give iran more time and a little more headache for the us
4455238 up to a point iran would be quietly happy but the conflict can escalate to something that would cause more instability and suffering
4455239 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims
4455240 some of our partners far from assisting us are attempting to impede us by transferring georgian troops on board us aircraft directly to the conflict zone
4455241 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
4455242 georgia is a marginal issue to the united states iran is a central issue
4455243 seriously limit its response to georgia to avoid a russian counter in iran
4455244 even if there are no more un sanctions on iran at least there can still be more us and european sanctions
4455245 nuclear and missile entities used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
4455246 i think russia has been playing us when it comes to sanctions and stringing it out for years and years
4455247 theyve never wanted sanctions and our position has moved to theirs not vice versa if you go back 12 years ago we were debating whether there should be a bushehr nuclear reactor now we are well beyond that today

4455249 the killer of arkansas democratic party chairman had written his victims name on a post it note and had two sets of car keys from his victims car dealership
4455250 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans that i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions that he has held and thats it
4455251 i would certainly not go above the level that existed under bill clinton which was 28 percent
4455252 men from purulia go to work in mumbai and other distant industrial areas and get infected with the virus the women get infected by their husbands and bear hiv positive children
4455253 situation is tense but under control no untoward incident was reported today
4455254 yes im overcompensating for my insecurities and lack of masculinity but ive got a really big dog
4455255 rwanda today needs skilled personnel rwoda is a very important institute in empowering people with skills so by working together with the vocational training centre it will be in position to increase the number of skilled personnel in the country
4455256 the three priority skill areas as identified by rwoda vocational pedagogy ict in networking and electronics servicing are undisputedly paramount for the implementation of national development programmes
4455257 this trainers training is very important because it will empower students with skills and by so doing address the skills development challenges facing the country across all sectors of the economy
4455258 skills development at vocational level is an important issue that rwanda wants to address immediately to address this a systematic approach has to be adopted first and foremost is the development of a demand led competency based curricula which we started in february 2008 with active participation from the industry practitioners
4455259 today we are ready to do a pilot run on the practical aspect of vocational skills applications on a day to day basis besides the skills training courses we recognized that not many instructors are trained in how to teach pedagogy
4455260 borrowed from the pedagogy training models of other countries and refined it to the local context so that we are able to implement the training today
4455261 afterward she and j t had a very nice conversation and began sorting through some of their issues
4455262 he apologized profusely for the months he spent bombarding her with dozens of text messages and voice mails but assured her he did it out of love and because he missed her so much
4455263 im not caught up in how big or small i am
4455264 some people say theyre a skinny person trapped in a big girls body and ive never seen myself like that i just feel like i could get a little healthier so why not
4455265 i had read that if you lost 5 percent of your body weight you could cut your chances of things like heart disease in half jenny craig mentioned the same statistic to me so we connected on a health level

4455282 da questo romanzo martin scorsese ha tratto la sceneggiatura dellomonimo film
4455283 die senkung war auch in diesem ausma erwartet worden und d rfte eigentlich bereits in den kursen enthalten sein
4455284 tu questanno hai avuto quattro o cinque dei tuoi libri in classifica contemporaneamente ma io non ne ho letto neanche uno
4455285 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share
4455286 every now and then ill stay if we have something early in the morning we have to do
4455287 it made no sense for that trial to proceed so we worked out an agreement
4455288 the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship
4455289 kevin has a wonderful heart i dont agree with giving him more money he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
4455290 i would hope that it stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at the time where britney is at that time
4455291 she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
4455292 im not running for the money im running for the glory
4455293 it wasnt as easy as i wanted it to be to qualify
4455294 i wanted to run outside and not to get boxed in
4455295 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4455296 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4455297 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4455298 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4455299 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4455300 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4455301 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4455302 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4455303 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4455304 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4455305 the three actors were totally heroic coming in this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say ok well do whatever it takes to help
4455306 they came they did the work they allowed the movie to be finished they didnt take money the money goes to heaths daughter thats extraordinary
4455307 i am so glad these guys are so humble thats why they make a great addition to the film it will be bittersweet seeing this movie knowing he was filming it only days before he died this picture still hurts to see because as we all know he did die a couple of days after this picture was taken my thoughts will always be with heath
4455308 ive sat down with roque and weve had a chat and the lad is happy to stay at blackburn rovers
4455309 roque and steve are definitely two players that i dont want to sell and they definitely wont be sold
4455310 i think we are close to doing something with robbie
4455311 ive said all along that he has to get his fitness and sharpness and we are now seeing good signs of that in the last three or four days in training hes been absolutely different class
4455312 weve done our tactical and technical preparation and on our work in training its now up to the team to express that on the field
4455313 its amazing that he could keep his passion for 100 tests like the other 800 springboks do it for every test they play he is a true professional and an inspiration to the whole team

4455332 nicht nur wir m ssen beim beten sauber sein und uns deswegen waschen sondern auch der boden darf nicht dreckig sein
4455333 bis zu 1000 m nner k nnen hier gleichzeitig beten
4455334 nur zwei k nste sind in der moschee erlaubt das rezitieren von gebeten und kalligrafien also das sch nschreiben deswegen gibt es hier auch keine bilder
4455335 die gebetsnische zeigt die gebetsrichtung an und der imam also der vorbeter hat hier seinen platz
4455336 von beiden wird gepredigt aber die kanzel ist dem freitagsgebet und den feiertagen vorbehalten
4455337 im kindergarten und in der schule sind ja auch muslimische kinder deswegen war es mir wichtig dass sie neben kirchen auch einmal eine moschee besuchen
4455338 bei uns in der kirche darf man die schuhe anlassen
4455339 von der kohle allein k nnen wir l ngst nicht mehr leben
4455340 es geht vielen nicht mehr um die liebe zum berg es geht ums erobern sie wollen abenteuer erleben aber risiken und unannehmlichkeiten nicht wahrhaben
4455341 je h her der schwierigkeitsgrad desto gr er ist die freude danach ich habe verst ndnis wenn die leute uns als volldeppen bezeichnen aber so ist das nun mal
4455342 jeder pr sentiert sich mit laptop und satellitentelefon das wird langsam zur hauptbesch ftigung dabei besteht das abenteuer doch darin auf sich gestellt zu sein v llig abgeschnitten von der au enwelt
4455343 im vergangenen jahr habe ich eine trekkinggruppe im himalaja gef hrt da h tte ich am liebsten einige erw rgt berall rumgem kelt den sherpas die arbeit weggenommen leistung abgespult sogar das zelt war zu klein sie wollten diese fremde welt gar nicht erfahren sondern nur damit angeben
4455344 ich w rde mir als bergf hrer nicht zutrauen fremde leute auf achttausender zu f hren ich k nnte in der todeszone nicht die n tige verantwortung f r sie bernehmen
4455345 die jungs fr her haben gro es geleistet aber heilige waren sie nie auch wenn einige jetzt so tun
4455346 reinhold messner kanzelt exzellente bergsteiger als touristen ab was der sagt ist schon l nger nicht mehr alles richtig
4455347 messner behauptete das seien kommerzielle expeditionen gewesen doch das stimmt einfach nicht
4455348 alles saustarke leute sie haben agenturen bis zum basislager genutzt wie das fast alle heute machen es ist wohl so indem man andere schlecht macht berh ht man seine ehemaligen leistungen
4455349 da sind unheimlich viele leute unterwegs und viele schwarze schafe unter den anbietern
4455350 wir k nnen die leute nicht am kurzen seil auf den gipfel bringen sie m ssen selbst dazu in der lage sein
4455351 im rahmen dessen was wir anbieten halte ich das f r eine geringe zahl
4455352 mein sohn hat mich mal gebeten nicht wieder auf den k2 zu steigen ich bin trotzdem gegangen er war damals zu klein um zu begreifen was mir das bedeutet
4455353 in drei stunden bin ich in den dolomiten der brenta zweieinhalb brauche ich zum montblanc
4455354 musst du eben so weit es geht die situation im griff behalten vorausschauen und immer einen notausgang offenhalten ich glaube nicht dass das in diesen extremen h hen mit fremden personen berhaupt geht
4455355 aber wenn ich bei meinen vortr gen erz hle dass ich noch nie am everest war dann schauen mich alle ganz verwundert an
4455356 da gibt es mittlerweile ein einziges fixseil das nimmst du am basislager in die hand und gehst bis oben
4455357 je mehr unvorbereitete kunden du hochf hrst umso mehr infrastruktur brauchst du gerade am everest erz hlen sie mir werden leute hochtransportiert wie ein sack kartoffeln ein sherpa zieht vorne einer schiebt von hinten
4455358 idealgel nde sowohl zum lernen als auch f r die schwierigsten sachen
4455359 irgendwann m chte man sich selbst auch woanders auf die probe stellen
4455360 in den alpen bist du ja oft am abend schon wieder daheim
4455361 das ist so was wie der moment der wahrheit da kannst du nicht mehr schummeln das ist ein kampf gegen was inneres und gegen was u eres es ist der konzentrierte saft des lebens da sind gl ck und tod so ganz nah beieinander ein absoluter moment
4455362 vielleicht hab ich mich auch deswegen f r dieses jahr ausgeklinkt weil ich mich nicht allzu sehr hineinverwickeln wollte
4455363 ich wollte nur was anderes machen ich wollte dieses jahr nicht in eine eiswand ich wollte unbedingt felsklettern daf r brauchst du viel kraft und wenn du von einer achttausender expedition zur ckkommst bist du so geschw cht dass du monate brauchst um dich wieder in form zu kriegen diese zeit hatte ich aber nicht die wollte ich nicht haben
4455364 halt doch viel sicherer da f llst du zwar unter umst nden weit brichst dir arme und beine aber du stirbst nicht so leicht das eis dagegen ist beweglich im dauernden fluss
4455365 das erste mal als mir ein freund bei einer tour abgest rzt ist war ich geschockt ber monate hinweg
4455366 aber inzwischen karl unterkircher ist nicht erst der zweite freund der so stirbt aber das geh rt zu unserem leben es ist das leben es ist der tod du denkst auch nicht dauernd daran
4455367 it is just by coincidence that i made the oath today god gave me the strength to do it
4455368 by swearing in gods homes that i was sodomised by my employer i challenge anwar ibrahim to swear and to do it in a mosque to deny my allegations
4455369 i would like to emphasise that it happened by force without my permission

4455372 we want to be in every major city in the world by the end of 2009
4455373 its not so much having our own room but the number of interconnections
4455374 customers have said they dont want to go first and ask who can i talk with
4455375 there are locations where you cant as an enterprise justify telepresence
4455376 outside the top ten economies its difficult to get capillarity into smaller markets
4455377 you have to have a long term view its a three to five year plan the rooms will be very profitable once we have a big network

4455380 a real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs
4455381 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
4455382 early this year i spent a few days in valencia with my family between the rollout and the next test we had a great time went to the beach and in town theres a dried out riverbed that has nature parks and playgrounds that was very nice especially for the children valencia is also a great place for shopping and eating out needless to say and i love the contrast between its historic and futuristic architecture im looking forward to the weekend
4455383 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
4455384 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
4455385 the short summer break after the race in budapest has benefited everyone
4455386 the european grand prix around the port area of valencia is new to the programme this year we are very much looking forward to the race and the city particularly as bmw has some close associations with valencia the formula bmw racing center there serves as the training site for our up and coming young talent in the formula bmw series around the world valencia is by tradition the venue for rolling out our new f1 car and beyond that city races always make for a unique atmosphere we await the new circuit with keen anticipation
4455387 valencia is a new venue in the calendar and as such poses a particular challenge not least because its a street circuit

4455399 hier haben wir einen zentralen ort in der stadt der bislang kaum erschlossen und nicht ffentlich zug nglich war
4455400 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4455401 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4455402 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4455403 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4455404 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4455405 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4455406 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4455407 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4455408 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4455409 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4455410 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4455411 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4455412 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4455413 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4455414 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4455415 only a few people are still with him and he only wants two things indemnity for the sins and crimes he committed in the past eight years and a piece of land so he can live rest of his life there
4455416 ive never really thought of myself as an artist especially with the artwork ive seen
4455417 were a young country here and there are ancient civilizations that have been around for thousands of years
4455418 its hard to put into words i can understand why people who go there feel an inspiration for god art like that gives a rich impression of the people and history that came up before to build all of that so much remains today that people will be able to see in the future it gives you a sense of immortality to be connected to that
4455419 i joined the military to get an opportunity to see what the rest of the world was like
4455420 and the military gives you a broader spectrum of the american culture its a blend of cultures
4455421 i got off the beaten path and connected with the real people
4455422 the couple invited me in for supper and even though we only half understood each other because we spoke different languages we still connected
4455423 i found out most of the time people are the same the world over everyone is just struggling to survive
4455424 you wna go out with some guy you dont know
4455425 well you cant be any worse than the guys i do know
4455426 nicht dazu angelegt und nicht darauf aus ein politisches buch zu sein
4455427 gr ndlich recherchiert und dokumentiert ist obama nation die ma gebliche quelle f r informationen dar ber warum und wie barack obama besiegt werden muss
4455428 die obama kampagne ver ffentlichte daraufhin prompt ein dementi in dem sie behauptet obama habe keinen gottesdienst in chicago am 22 juli besucht
4455429 none of them had an extensive record of any sort
4455430 its hard to do let alone trying to develop the mind set of what would cause someone to shoot a guy who handed over the money
4455431 there was absolutely no reason for him to be shot
4455432 there are no words to thank them enough for what they have done for us
4455433 they were relentless in their pursuit they are just heroes to us
4455434 this technological collaboration enables users to reduce wasted energy while still being able to conveniently access all their files even when on the go
4455435 intel and jajah have a common objective to deploy technology building blocks that deliver a richer communication experience for consumers
4455436 the strategic planning of regional resources under the formation of market relations
4455437 on guarantees for former president of the russian federation and members of his family
4455438 helped mr putin enter the family and funded the party that formed mr putins parliamentary base
4455439 despite claims by president vladimir putin that the kremlin had no interest in bankrupting yukos the companys assets were auctioned at below market value in addition new debts suddenly emerged out of nowhere preventing the company from surviving the main beneficiary of these tactics was rosneft it is clearer now than ever that the expropriation of yukos was a ploy to put key elements of the energy sector in the hands of putins retinue moreover the yukos affair marked a turning point in russias commitment to domestic property rights and the rule of law
4455440 the entirety of state owned and controlled enterprises are run by and for the benefit of the cabal around putin a collection of former kgb colleagues saint petersburg lawyers and other political cronies
4455441 sovereign democracy is a kremlin coinage that conveys two messages first that russias regime is democratic and second that this claim must be accepted period any attempt at verification will be regarded as unfriendly and as meddling in russias domestic affairs
4455442 demonstrate that famous people can be murdered in russia in the daylight
4455443 help instill young people with a sense of pride in russia
4455444 keep alive the memory of tragedies of the past we should focus on all that is best in the country
4455445 a term of five six or seven years in office would be entirely acceptable
4455446 the traits of extreme right wing dictatorship the dominance of state monopoly capital in the economy
4455447 putin has built a political construction that resembles a pyramid which rests on its tip rather than on its base
4455448 the main lesson we should have learned from putins eight years in office is a recognition that under the traditional russian political system that he has revitalized not only do officials not mean what they say but also that obfuscation is essential to the way it all works putins playing of the russian political game has been virtuosic
4455449 mr putin will remain russias real ruler for some time to come and the ex kgb men he promoted will stay close to the seat of power
4455450 russia has and always will have responses to these new challenges
4455451 no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race
4455452 fair and democratic world order that would ensure security and prosperity not only for a select few but for all
4455453 putin has also suppressed many of the freedoms won after the fall of communism created a new class of oligarchs and interfered deeply in the internal affairs of former soviet republics
4455454 he was a kgb agent by definition he doesnt have a soul
4455455 i think that a head of state must have a head as a minimum and in order to build interstate relationships one must be governed by the fundamental interest of ones own country rather than by emotions
4455456 russia has long since fulfilled all its istanbul obligations relevant to cfe
4455457 deeply regretted the russian federations decision to suspend implementation of its obligations under the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe cfe
4455458 russias conventional forces are the largest on the european continent and its unilateral action damages this successful arms control regime
4455459 these threats are not becoming fewer but are only transforming and changing their appearance these new threats just as under the third reich show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world
4455460 putin is not a stalin there are no mass purges in russia today no broad climate of terror but putin is reconstituting a strong state and anyone who stands in his way will pay for it
4455461 a return to the direct military confrontation of the cold war is unlikely
4455462 the notion of western friendship with russia is a dead letter
4455463 we all face many common problems and challenges that must be addressed in partnership with other countries including russia one cold war was quite enough
4455464 the united states continues building a strategic shield in poland and the czech republic
4455465 if part of the united states nuclear capability is situated in europe and that our military experts consider that they represent a potential threat then we will have to take appropriate retaliatory steps what steps of course we must have new targets in europe
4455466 four russian envoys over putins refusal to extradite ex kgb agent andrei lugovoi wanted in the uk for the murder of fellow former spy 152 the russian constitution prohibits the extradition of russian nationals to third countries
4455467 this situation is not unique and other countries have amended their constitutions for example to give effect to the european arrest warrant
4455468 the biggest rift since the countries expelled each others diplomats in 1996 after a spying dispute
4455469 i think we will overcome this mini crisis russian british relations will develop normally on both the russian side and the british side we are interested in the development of those relations
4455470 face greater scrutiny from tax and regulatory authorities and they could also lose out in government tenders
4455471 if russia feels as though they want to take some of these old aircraft out of mothballs and get them flying again thats their decision
4455472 western observers are already likening the sco to a military organisation that would stand in opposition to nato
4455473 this kind of comparison is inappropriate in both form and substance
4455474 there should be no talk of creating a military or political alliance or union of any kind because this would contradict the founding principles of sco
4455475 all our caspian states have the right to develop their peaceful nuclear programmes without any restrictions
4455476 we are ready to supply funds for financing it just as europe covers the costs of projects in russia
4455477 europes nightmares are the 1930s russias nightmares are the 1990s europe sees the answer to its problems in transcending the nation state and power for russians the solution is in restoring them so what happens when a 21st century entity faces the challenge of a 19th century power the contours of the conflict are already emerging in diplomatic stand offs over kosovo ukraine georgia and estonia in conflicts over gas and oil pipelines in nasty diplomatic exchanges between russia and britain and in a return to russian military exercises of a kind not seen since the cold war europeans are apprehensive with good reason
4455478 they want russia to be a modern strong and free country their ideology is clear it is modernization of the country and preservation of its sovereignty with that
4455479 movements brownshirt tactics certain evoke shades of hitler youth as does the emphasis on physical fitness clean living and procreation for the motherland
4455480 sliding into fascism with state control of the economy media politics and society becoming increasingly heavy handed
4455481 putin was dissatisfied with how nashi was faring they were causing tensions with the west medvedev positions himself as a friend of the west and aggressive national patriotic support does not fit in with that image
4455482 neither the russian nor the american publics are convinced russia is headed in an anti democratic direction
4455483 russians generally support putins concentration of political power and strongly support the re nationalization of russias oil and gas industry
4455484 extraordinary feat of leadership in taking a country that was in chaos and bringing it stability
4455485 times person of the year is not and never has been an honor it is not an endorsement it is not a popularity contest at its best it is a clear eyed recognition of the world as it is and of the most powerful individuals and forces shaping that world for better or for worse
4455486 despite gorbachevs acknowledgment that the news media have been suppressed and that election rules run counter to the democratic ideals he has promoted
4455487 shall not prevent other citizens from living a normal life
4455488 it is important to give everyone the opportunity to criticize the authorities but this should be done in a civilized fashion
4455489 those who oppose us dont want us to realize our plan they need a weak sick state they need a disorganized and disoriented society a divided society so that they can do their deeds behind its back and eat cake on our tab
4455490 russia has become in the precise sense of the word a fascist state
4455491 as parliamentary and presidential elections in late 2007 and early 2008 approached the administration headed by president vladimir putin cracked down on civil society and freedom of assembly reconstruction in chechnya did not mask grave human rights abuses including torture abductions and unlawful detentions international criticism of russias human rights record remains muted with the european union failing to challenge russia on its human rights record in a consistent and sustained manner
4455492 sharply criticized the state of russias electoral system and called for extensive reforms to a system that has secured power for president vladimir v putin and the kremlins inner circle
4455493 no wonder that mikhail gorbachev the soviet unions last leader felt moved to speak out
4455494 after our first meetings in 1999 and 2000 i described him in my journal as
4455495 it is unlikely that putin 55 will wear out his welcome at home anytime soon as he has nearly done with many democracies abroad in the meantime he will remain an irritant to a source of division within europe and yet another reason for the west to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels
4455496 looking after putins business interests and swallowing up a vast share of the nations financial flows
4455497 a model communist genuinely believing in its ideals while trying to put them into practice in his own life
4455498 i did as she said and then put the cross around my neck i have never taken it off since
4455499 there are things i believe which should not in my position at least be shared with the public at large for everybodys consumption because that would look like self advertising or a political striptease
4455500 putins name doesnt appear on any shareholders register of course there is a non transparent scheme of successive ownership of offshore companies and funds the final point is in zug in switzerland and liechtenstein vladimir putin should be the beneficiary owner
4455501 i think the statements of your vice president of this sort are the same as an 283 u
4455502 we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq i will tell you quite honestly
4455503 my approach toward gay parades and sexual minorities is very simple it is directly linked to my responsibilities one of the key problems of our country is the demographic problem
4455504 access to capital for creators seems to be the largest issue facing the media industry today
4455505 and this is especially an issue for african american women latino and other diverse creators by providing both venture capital funding and access to cutting edge business development tools we plan to reduce risk and better support creators in making the best creative and business decisions in the earliest stages of production
4455506 azcatl seed capital fund will actively support innovation in design business models and content
4455507 how people get their media is changing with innovations like video on the internet digital distribution via xbox live and convenient web browsing on the iphone people can increasingly access their favorite media anywhere and on demand we believe our model of venture capital funding linked with strong professional services provided in part by veteran fellow creators and artists is a powerful approach we also anticipate raising a second fund for expansion capital to support those companies that graduate out of azcatl seed capital fund i

4455511 a hedge fund manager this week insisted that rnwk might even consider spinning out realgames since it would be worth far more as an independent entity than it is stuck inside real but i dont take that concept too seriously even if its a logical step
4455512 realnetworks purchased macrovisions games business for 4 million last year it bought a casual games site called gametrust for about 20 million its all part of realnetworks ceo rob glasers plan to be a player in casual games just like he planned to be a player in online music you know before apple crushed him or like how he planned to be a player in online video before adobes flash laid him low we give glaser this much credit he keeps spotting opportunities the best business plan going seems to be to watch what markets glaser enters follow him and do a better job

4455533 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4455534 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4455535 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4455536 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4455537 yo mismo andaluz sevillano hasta la m dula de all soy de all mis padres y mis abuelos
4455538 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4455539 we believe 99 percent of the bigfoot world is lunatics
4455540 thats what our videos are about we just wanted to turn things around and make fun of the bigfoot world and how crazy they are
4455541 are just huge frauds and the thing about it is when we come out with the bigfoot and evidence of a true bigfoot all the fraud things theyve been saying and what they put out there as gospel is no longer true

4455550 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4455551 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4455552 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4455553 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4455554 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4455555 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4455556 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4455557 it is just by coincidence that i made the oath today god gave me the strength to do it
4455558 by swearing in gods homes that i was sodomised by my employer i challenge anwar ibrahim to swear and to do it in a mosque to deny my allegations

4455575 if the writer is a socially privileged person particularly a white or a male or both his imagination may have to make an intense and conscious effort to realize that people who dont share his privileged status may read his work and will not share with him many attitudes and opinions that he has been allowed to believe or pretend are shared by everybody since the belief in a privileged view of reality is no longer tenable outside privileged circles and often not even within them fiction written from such an assumption will make sense only to a decreasing and increasingly reactionary audience many women writing today however still choose the male viewpoint finding it easier to do so than to write from the knowledge that feminine experience of reality is flatly denied by many potential readers including the majority of critics and professors of literature and may rouse defensive hostility and contempt the choice then would seem to be between collusion and subversion but theres no use pretending that you can get away without making a choice not to choose these days is a choice made all fiction has ethical political and social weight and sometimes the works that weigh the heaviest are those apparently fluffy or escapist fictions whose authors declare themselves above politics just entertainers and so on
4455576 the emergence of serious problems in international credit markets over the past year combined with the slowdown in the uk residential property market means that housing associations are facing challenging times
4455577 however demand for affordable homes is at an all time high a fact recognised by the governments 8 4 billion three year investment programme which should raise the number of homes for rent built each year from 30 000 in 2007 08 to 45 000 by 2010 11
4455578 we believe that the sector overall and the vast majority of associations continue to be well placed to weather any downturn
4455579 it continues to be our view that this should not as a matter of routine lead to failure or insolvency but could result in some restructuring in the market leading to new mergers consolidations and or we could see a slow down in development activity until the housing market achieves stability
4455580 in july 2008 the housing corporation undertook a third survey of the 100 largest developers plus other significant associations nationally as with our earlier surveys in january and april we sought to ascertain views on the funding and housing markets
4455581 the immediate concern for housing associations remains the performance of the housing market rather than their ability to obtain finance at a reasonable price
4455582 although there is now firm evidence that margins on variable rate debt are increasing and the number of potential funders has reduced since the start of the year
4455583 our july survey confirmed that most associations have facilities that stretch for more than two years worth of projected draw downs a small number of associations are intending to raise new debt
4455584 our survey shows that of the 5 6 billion associations intend to drawdown in the next 12 months only 0 4 billion is new debt which has still to be arranged
4455585 we have followed up this work with individual discussions with associations and lenders
4455586 associations have not seen the further reductions in bank base rate result in keener pricing
4455587 there is some evidence that where new debt is required conditions relating to existing agreed facilities are also being scrutinised by lenders in some instances this has led to a renegotiation of the price on existing debt in line with rates paid on new facilities
4455588 despite this there remains evidence that associations are still able to access new borrowing albeit raising new money from existing funders continues to be easier than accessing funds from new lenders
4455589 the longer term outlook for raising private finance for affordable housing remains positive this after all offers investors the opportunity to invest in bricks and mortar in an asset class that enjoys consistent rpi linked income growth with over 60 of that in the form of housing benefits and therefore a secure revenue stream
4455590 as the margins on debt increase the housing sector starts to become attractive to the capital markets and we have evidence from the survey that a number of bond issues are being considered
4455591 so with nearly 10 billion of credit already in place to help fund the next three years business plans of associations for new build and major repairs works the second major risk facing the sector is how a fall in house prices would reduce the surpluses associations are able to generate from low cost home ownership sales
4455592 the associations most at risk here are those that are not generating sufficient cash from ongoing activities to meet interest cover payments without the inclusion of sales proceeds
4455593 in april we reported that as well as seeing a slowdown in stair casing sales there was some evidence that sales of first tranches are also slowing
4455594 flats however appear to be less attractive as market conditions continue to deteriorate all associations are reporting that the length of time taken from initial viewing to completion is longer and prospective purchasers are experiencing more difficulty in putting finances in place
4455595 despite this we are aware that some associations are still able to sell off plan and at the full asking price in other cases associations are offering incentives to ensure the sale of completed properties
4455596 without strong management action organisations could be exposed if they cannot sell properties in sufficient volumes and at appropriate prices
4455597 following our april survey we stated that we expected good boards and management teams to be stress testing their business plans and scenario scanning to confirm what actions they would take if a combination of adverse factors came in to play at the same time
4455598 the july survey results provided evidence that associations are taking this seriously and are undertaking extensive stress testing to ascertain the robustness of their business plans
4455599 from our own analysis we believe a 20 fall in sales values is a risk that could be tolerated by most providers but for some this also offers an opportunity to consider whether there are better ways to achieve their growth strategies through new partnerships that could help shield construction cost or sales risks from the association
4455600 we remain of the view that the control of management and maintenance costs is the most significant medium term prize
4455601 with no correlation between expenditure and tenant satisfaction the opportunities for action here remain significant
4455602 this was a blatant cheat on the public purse this was a benefit fraud

4455608 everyone needs to know that anyone who blatantly cheats the system in this way will be punished when brought to court
4455609 benefits fraudsters need to be alerted that we are catching up with them

4455621 the strong dollar trend continued the movement in the exchange rate in the past weeks has been correlated to the movement in oil and equities but lately it has been the strong dollar story that dictated market movement
4455622 thats the end of the rate cuts by the fed the fed will start raising rates so global liquidity is shifting to the dollar
4455623 the dollar strengthened across the board given the outlook that there will be a rate hike in the us while european central banks are contemplating on bringing down their interest rates
4455624 the market was flat as expected given the long weekend fund mangers chose to take a vacation from the market
4455625 the market still has no momentum there is still no serious investor willing to invest in the market for the long term
4455626 it is still the same story for the market it would continue to track prices of crude and the us market
4455627 the first half numbers clearly indicate that mpic is on a strong financial footing our companies led by maynilad are evidencing the ability to deliver healthy sustainable profits
4455628 mpic would continue to consider opportunities in its core sectors of infrastructure and healthcare as well as in growth segments such as mining
4455629 the trend is good and we are hitting an all time high in billed volume and non revenue water expect this trend to continue in the second half
4455630 liquidity issues resulted in delays in construction which impacted revenues recognized for the period
4455631 to date the message has been that policy makers react with caution to commodity price volatility the same should be true going forward
4455632 however dramatically lower commodity prices would no doubt be welcomed by policy makers whose jobs have been complicated by high inflation in the context of a global growth slowdown
4455633 the thai governments measures to temporarily depress inflation make this conclusion all the more likely and we note that the philippines inflation outcome is very sensitive to food prices
4455634 this makes sense up to a point but the risk is now that yields may have come off too far too fast still accommodative monetary conditions and commodity price volatility could mean it is too early to call the all clear on the trend in inflation

4455644 can the executive branch commit to the people that congress will amend the constitution to conform with the moa
4455645 no state in history has unilaterally ceded to any proposal to give its territories
4455646 nowhere in the moa that the constitution was explicitly mentioned the language is too vague too ambiguous
4455647 how can there be a violation of the constitution when the moa has not yet been signed
4455648 can there be violations of the constitution when the documents is not yet executory unless an actual event happens theres an actionable action that this can be nullified
4455649 were not saying that we do not want this to proceed give us time to file our comments first were not given the chance to answer
4455650 we stand by our position not to join any move to re draft the ancestral domain agreement
4455651 if the supreme court rejects the moa it does not mean that the talks with milf is over i think it behooves the government the peace panel and everybody concerned to have a backup plan if they are determined to pursue peace plan
4455652 we will not stop no setback is big enough to stop us from pursuing the peace agreement i can imagine we can do this purse peace process as long as there is openness and goodwill and good faith we should not be deterred by any result of the hearings or decision of the supreme court
4455653 we would rather not talk about it let us just wait for the supreme court decision
4455654 it would be best for all concerned to simply present their argument on the letter of the moa and not make unfounded conspiracy theories to try to excite public over matters that only exist in the minds of conspiracy theorists

4455667 ich bin zum einschwimmen gegangen dann habe ich noch mal mit norbert gesprochen norbert warnatzsch ihr trainer mit frau janofske gesprochen ihrer mentaltrainerin
4455668 ich hatte eine sehr gute unterst tzung es ist ja heute blich dass man jemand mit zum vorstart nimmt weil man heute in diese hochtechnologischen schwimmanz ge gar nicht mehr alleine reinkommt das war nicole hetzer die hat mich aufgebaut und gesagt wei t du britta das wichtigste ist nicht der sieg sondern der kampf und der wille eine gute leistung zu zeigen und ich wusste ich kann k mpfen ich will eine gute leistung zeigen unabh ngig vom ergebnis
4455669 dann sind wir reingelaufen es ging los und pl tzlich war alles wie in trance
4455670 es war ein moment in dem ich dachte das genie te jetzte egal was an der anzeigetafel steht selbst wenn es nicht gold ist dann habe ich mich umgedreht und dachte ha doch gewonnen
4455671 von mama papa ich habs geschafft bis hin zu haha sch n ich habe es mir selbst bewiesen war alles dabei
4455672 ich rufe jetzt meine familie und meinen freund an um das mit ihnen zu teilen

4455677 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4455678 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4455679 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4455680 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4455681 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4455682 its not normal for us to sell out of flavors
4455683 i just came from a heat wave in ohio which was humid so this is wonderful
4455684 im standing behind a pole and wearing a hat i have to be careful or ill fry
4455685 the conversion of a parking garage built in the 1960s to a platinum leed certified structure that includes class a office space and top of the line retail space is unheard of
4455686 the embodiment of where we need to go with society in terms of environmental responsibility
4455687 you probably wont see your money back but you really have a sustainable building
4455688 i feel like i found my perfect fit shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
4455689 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4455690 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4455691 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous marvelous engraver
4455692 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
4455693 the records not finished its supposed to be me and
4455694 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have
4455695 so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
4455696 having the support of my fans on the second round was just incredible and its even getting bigger now
4455697 were going to do our thing and have a lot of fun
4455698 ich wollte mich einfach nur freuen weil ich so ein super rennen
4455699 ich wollte mich vom hohen tempo der anderen nicht beeinflussen lassen
4455700 ich wusste was sie konnte ihr finish war vom allerfeinsten
4455701 ich hatte eine medaille erhofft dass es gold wurde ist eine sp te genugtuung f r das deutsche schwimmen
4455702 seriously im talking about the riddler the riddler should be the villain in the next batman film so i drew a huge question mark get it
4455703 as we looked through the comics there was this fascinating idea that batmans presence in gotham actually attracts criminals to gotham it attracts lunacy
4455704 my problem is i dont want some se7en like villian coming to the scene its going to feel very flat especially in batmans world
4455705 there are other characters that would being more of a challenge
4455706 when i eventually met mr right i had no idea that his first name was always
4455707 she was afraid that my people especially my family wouldnt like her an ugly girl
4455708 total employment decreased in both goods producing and service providing industries and the unemployment rate rose to 7 2 percent
4455709 most film companies have always looked down on the audience
4455710 theyve always had the attitude that that this audience is undiscriminating
4455711 ive always wanted to do the commentary for enter the dragon
4455712 he makes these films accessible and hes a terrific pop culture figure
4455713 aber gerade f r maler und malerinnen ist es wichtig licht und sonne zu sehen
4455714 dann m sste ich meinen mann ja um erlaubnis bitten k nstlerisch t tig zu sein
4455715 make sure that the class defined in this code file matches the inherits attribute
4455716 to love him with all your heart with all your understanding and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices
4455717 loh inikan iklan regional kita dubbing saja karena produksinya di thailand
4455718 ive gotta put something in there that appeals to the hannah montana crowd
4455719 she and her family are in our thoughts and prayers
4455720 we are all pulling for her to make a full and complete recovery
4455721 what we were expecting was about 1 200 riders per month one way trips back and forth
4455722 i think the high gas prices make that an expensive commute
4455723 i think people just realized for a 6 round trip you really cant beat it you can sit down and relax you can read take a nap
4455724 they dont have cars now they can get a job it allows them to work
4455725 weve got a finite amount of money and a finite number of buses
4455726 were pretty much maxed out wed like to run more buses if we can the need is out there but we cant go any bigger than we are right now
4455727 mchugh has contacted the federal department of veterans affairs to see what the likelihood would be of establishing a va clinic in the tri lakes area
4455728 my first preference would be somewhere near or in association with adirondack medical center oftentimes thats where you have a clinic by a hospital
4455729 the congressman has asked the va to look into it and see
4455730 the va needs to see if the area meets the requirements for a va outpatient clinic were waiting to hear back
4455731 in these time of high gas prices it is not fair to our veterans and there are many of them in the tri lakes area to have to travel that distance and pay the gas
4455732 the decision ultimately lies with the department of veterans affairs
4455733 mr mchugh is making sure they have the information to inform their decisionmaking process
4455734 we should write a letter to the district attorney that we are dissatisfied with the outcome of this investigation
4455735 the allegations against this individual represent a very serious breach of trust against the taxpayers of franklin
4455736 the decision to let this person walk away with only a resignation is very difficult to comprehend
4455737 since he was out on disability theres no way to reimburse the town or get that money back
4455738 i thought it was more cost effective for the town if he resigned immediately and that is what we were able to secure through discussions with his defense counsel
4455739 we are no longer paying him a salary he did the wrong thing he resigned we are not paying him a salary
4455740 us spending 15 000 on this guy while hes cutting his wood and fixing his lawn is a breach of the taxpayers trust there should be retribution
4455741 there is possible theft of services there is possible theft of goods
4455742 our criminal attorney is the attorney general thats a major red herring
4455743 ninety percent of the towns employees should be reprimanded too
4455744 going to plattsburgh for his medicine cleaning his chimney what are they 2 year olds they have a union why couldnt they go cry to them im thinking these guys who work for the town should also be punished some way
4455745 were a not for profit entity and we are all volunteers
4455746 what we are trying to do is make enough to sustain the tournament and then hopefully have some extra to help youth sports and provide some scholarships
4455747 right now we award the jodi higginbotham scholarship to a saranac lake graduate but wed love to someday be able to come up with scholarship money for tupper lake and lake placid students
4455748 id even love to see some of that going to north country community college too
4455749 were bringing a lot of people into town for three days and basically we want everybody to be happy
4455750 thats the local community and the rugby players who come here
4455751 we were really cramped we need lake placid especially because we have added more divisions
4455752 we plan to be back on some of the fields in lake placid next year
4455753 we have always had a great relationship with a amp m beverages and bud light and we still do
4455754 i dont blame them at all for not providing us with as much as they used to new yorks laws limit the advertising so they dont get the same exposure they did in previous years their hands are tied but they still are going to be there for us
4455755 what we are ultimately looking for is for someone to pick up for bud light
4455756 we had some local businesses come through and wed love to get some more help it would be great if somebody stepped up with a 5 000 sponsorship our prayers would be answered if somebody stepped forward with 10 000
4455757 it is ritas turn today to learn about men take his cock in your mouth and taste it

4455761 were talking to hillary we arent talking to those people
4455762 well it looks like the clintons are finally done for good theyll never get near the white house again
4455763 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire to stop the horrible wars and to free the united states of america from the slime mold that is eating the economic lower 80 of our population alive and i think that people want to feel like o k its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama there is not even an ice cubes chance in hell that his nomination could mean anything but disaster for our country and we damn well know it that is what we want to convince the dnc most people believe is the best way to go no decisions have been made we have a window of opportunity here and so we are trying to work all this through with the corrupt and dangerous dnc and with the corrupt and dangerous obama campaign
4455764 delegates can decide this on their own they dont need permission they can decide under the rules of the dnc
4455765 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4455766 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
4455767 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4455768 take your time be patient with the lord be patient with yourself

4455820 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4455821 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4455822 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4455836 this fund is an excellent choice to anchor most investors bond portfolios especially those unwilling to take on substantial credit risk it boasts low expenses broad diversification and experienced management

4455850 from our standpoint it had many hours of broadcast time so it was exposed its not like it was stifled and no one heard it

4455861 personally i want to keep improving be successful and win more things
4455862 hopefully that will drive us on to more success this season it is harder in the sense that all the other teams have improved and are getting better weve been champions two years on the spin and are even more of a scalp so teams are really up for it we managed to overcome that challenge last season and that success drives you on i think we will improve this season as well as other teams and its who can do it over the course of a season weve managed to do it the past couple of years and its the test to do it again
4455863 the big clubs are always going to be in there towards the end of the season and it is really tough
4455864 those type of things are won and lost on really small things as we saw in the final last year so you need that bit of luck weve shown we can do it once so we will try to do it again if we were to do it again this season two years in a row it would be absolutely incredible but weve got to perform and see how far it takes us
4455865 si alguien contin a atacando a nuestros ciudadanos nuestras fuerzas de paz por supuesto responderemos justamente del mismo modo en que hemos respondido no debe haber ninguna duda al respecto

4455868 desgraciadamente con lo que ha ocurrido es poco probable que los osetas del sur y los abjasios puedan vivir en un mismo estado con los georgianos
4455869 the ref cant make that call that early in the game
4455870 hes the leading evangelical figure hes trying to craft a new direction a new image for evangelicals the fact that this is happening at saddleback not focus on the family makes it more neutral ground its an audience that both obama and mccain have a real shot at getting
4455871 take up the causes that are politically correct and dont want to take up issues that are controversial
4455872 we thank god for his emphasis but its interesting that the candidates are going to a voice that has been somewhat silent on the great foundational issues of abortion and marriage even though he would stand for those
4455873 we are in danger of losing this whole country to the secularism of europe
4455874 i dont see any conflict at all and if there was i wouldnt be a part of it
4455875 im focused on the same thing rick warren is focused on i think evangelicals must be talking about disease and poverty
4455876 i believe that pastor rick is going to ask a wide range of questions and i believe he will ask questions about issues of life efforts to redefine marriage the importance of family and other issues that are of concern to traditional evangelicals
4455877 i dont know how hard he will press its sort of a new role for him
4455878 using his influence to become the next jerry falwell or james dobson
4455879 if you dont just focus on those two issues if you say there are a variety of issues that ought to be of concern to evangelicals you can plausibly see evangelicals saying obama is better on the first three mccain is better on the last two
4455880 mccain and the republicans need to have evangelicals vote mostly on social issues
4455881 if they do that theyll vote mccain obama is a very strong candidate to appeal to moderate evangelicals he talks about his faith in a compelling way and appeals to them on poverty the environment and the desire for change
4455882 counter my convictions and the convictions of masses of believing americans
4455883 i think the church is in danger of a deception of being courted by senator obama
4455884 you need a certain amount of literacy to be able to play computer games these days a lot of them have on screen messages and instructions that you must follow i think its just a kind of literacy that we dont measure because it isnt happening in the classroom
4455885 get parents passionate about reading because the parents will pass it on to their kids its never too early to start them and its never too late
4455886 the first thing that springs to mind with a draw like that are the travelling difficulties both for the team but in particular our supporters its a really tough draw in that sense and especially when you consider that we are in london on the saturday anyway for the orient game however from a football point of view and definitely from a player point of view its a cracking game our players can now put themselves up against a team that is expected to make it to the premier league next season so we can look forward to facing a challenge like that yes of course we would have preferred it to have been at home but well take the experience and see what we can use from it prior to the shrewsbury game we mentioned that we wanted to go through so that we could face another test in the second round and thats exactly what weve got
4455887 they are a side that are getting plenty of publicity both on and off the pitch
4455888 they have some high profile backing now and they genuinely expect to make that next step up i think its quite exciting for us to go up against a team like that i dont think many people will give us much of a chance but we dont mind that well be going down there to give it a go and we will be doing our best to get through to round three you never know we might actually get a home draw if we do
4455889 the first thing we did this morning was sit down and look at the logistics of it all
4455890 we are considering all of the options and i would imagine at this point that we will decide to travel back up after the orient game and then go down there again on the monday i think the lads would prefer to be back at home on the sunday and get a bit of rest and family time rather than stay down there but well see
4455891 our intention is still to go ahead with the open training session on the monday after the orient game as we had arranged
4455892 thats something that we are very keen to do with the fans but obviously we do have to see where we are once we have finalised our qpr travelling details
4455893 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4455894 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4455895 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4455896 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4455897 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4455898 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4455899 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4455900 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4455901 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4455902 if you have to run into a brickwall at least try and find a softer one
4455903 der deal k nnte bereits anfang n chster woche nach einer absegnung durch den conti aufsichtsrat verk ndet werden
4455904 letzte details wollen conti und schaeffler ber das wochenende kl ren

4455906 es ist nicht auszuschlie en dass wennemer in einem jahr in den ruhestand geht
4455907 druck haben auch die autokonzerne gemacht denen sehr an einer schnellen einigung gelegen war
4455908 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4455909 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4455910 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4455911 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4455912 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4455913 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4455914 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4455915 an increasing of our offshore reserves of oil and gas is not the long term answer but effective action in the short term while we pursue this all of the above strategy
4455916 my response to the department of energy is lets try it lets try everything lets drill and drill now
4455917 sen obama said the surge wouldnt work that it would fail he voted to cut off funding for the men and women serving in iraq he refuses to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded
4455918 his recommended course of action has been called by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as a course very dangerous for america so i think hes wrong and i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party
4455919 at this time last year when i was here not only was i declared dead but i was reminded of the words of chairman mao who once said its darkest before its totally black
4455920 i think they want to have a situation that sends a message to the other nations in the region the baltics ukraine etc that they are now reasserting their traditional role of the russian empire in the region
4455921 ik moest onder mijn eigen belgisch record gaan om me te plaatsen en begon heel snel
4455922 als in de steeple de man met de hamer komt dan val je letterlijk stil
4455923 people need to know this is the real jon powers
4455924 he flagrantly disrespects a police officer is found guilty of disorderly conduct and never tells anyone after 10 years of scandal and embarrassing headlines we dont need more of the same we deserve a congressman who will tell the truth
4455925 at a time when hes under investigation and running from revelations of election fraud and bribery the davis campaign is practicing the lowest form of politics by distorting simple facts
4455926 jon was written a ticket for jaywalking never arrested and never showed any disrespect to law enforcement
4455927 i wonder how many people at that press conference put their lives on the line in iraq
4455928 there are no reports of an american troop being killed
4455929 at least 127 american military instructors were in georgia at the beginning of the conflict there were joint training sessions that happened right before the start of the conflict
4455930 if we need to do dna tests we will do it
4455931 they were specifically to train them for a coming operation iraqi freedom deployment
4455932 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4455933 is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
4455934 drugs can be utilized to achieve abnormal diseased or disordered psychology
4455935 it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
4455936 its too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
4455937 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4455938 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4455939 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4455940 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4455941 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4455942 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4455943 at some point they will be kidnapped and lashed to a tree while variety
4455944 aangezien de energiestroom niet constant is zouden we te weinig energie opwekken op drukke momenten bijvoorbeeld aan het begin van de avond als iedereen thuis is
4455945 we bekijken of we een vierde turbine zullen plaatsen waarmee we direct stroom kunnen verkopen aan een viskwekerij op het eiland
4455946 het doorverkopen van gebruikte molens is een hartstikke goed zaak
4455947 op het afgelegen platteland van roemeni of hongarije is aansluiting op het bestaande elektriciteitsnet heel duur en gecompliceerd een windmolen kan dan een oplossing zijn
4455948 in nederland kunnen we beter nieuwe turbines plaatsen dat levert de meeste duurzame energie op
4455949 hopefully it means he can get justice in the united states he wants accountability and truth about why he was sent to syria
4455950 we dont know how it happened but the fact that they decided to do it on their own shows that they think the matter is extremely important
4455951 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4455952 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4455953 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

4455966 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
4455967 in the end i believe nevadans agree that the path to prosperity now is as important as it was a quarter century ago when peace through strength lower taxes on our workers and businesses and free market principles to encourage ingenuity economic growth improved consumer goods and lower prices this election all of those same issues are up for grabs and i believe nevadans will help elect senator john mccain as our next president
4455968 this could just be one of the most exciting cars to hit the road since well since the original mini cooper handbrake turned onto the scene sadly though the reality is anything but instead of being the best sporting mini ever created it is the least appealing ive driven

4455972 when we feel we must kill an animal for some legitimate purpose death should be instantaneous unsuspected and as non traumatic as possible if at any time for any reason it looks as though a quick non traumatic death of an animal is not possible to deliver then it should be postponed until it is possible
4455973 the only way to change an enemy into a friend is with love
4455974 i still believe that it is difficult for most people to experience their best health while following a 100 percent vegan diet for more than several years at most

4455982 then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast and his kingdom became full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain and they blashphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores boils and did not repent of their deeds mentioned a second time in this chapter then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up so that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are spirits of demons performing signs which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty behold i am coming as a thief blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame and they gathered them together to the place called in hebrew armageddon

4456000 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
4456001 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
4456002 my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4456003 the decentralized diagnostic testing markets business challenges and marketing strategies
4456004 por un beso yo no se que te diera por un beso
4456005 it is now possible for more people than ever to collaborate and compete in real time with more people on more different kinds of work from more different corners of the planet and on a more equal footing than at any previous time in the history of the world
4456006 as with the internet that helped to shape it the new environment is always on because the consumer is always present constantly seeking opportunities and value taking advantage of the multiplying media around it and at the same time being bombarded with ever more media in ever more forms
4456007 always on as well they have no respite or downtime because the rapidly changing nature of their audiences and the means of connecting with them requires continual experimentation innovation and shifts in strategy
4456008 how much their actual value to marketers has shifted fro the big creative idea and the most efficient media buy to the most sophisticated and innovative media planning
4456009 there is no longer any downtime in advertising media or marketing the pace is so relentless that the expression 24 7 does not do it justice think more in terms of 60 60 24 7 every second a connection is being made with a consumer somewhere so marketers media companies and advertising agencies must be always on
4456010 we are all in each others world the more we know each other the more helpful relevant and entertaining the marketing and advertising of products and services can be
4456011 60 60 24 7 future for advertising marketing and media
4456012 predictions no these are the implications of a future that has already happened
4456013 it was the best of times it was the worse of times
4456014 all generations of my family are peasants i thought weight lifting might be a way to change her fate
4456015 i was quite disturbed by the information from the report i read and i said no i cant stand by and not know the truth about this we can either be a victim of statistics or allow our findings to be utilized to become a catalyst for a victory for the savior
4456016 do what they want and they dont care about the average person
4456017 we want to know the truth but no one will tell us
4456018 we need an anchor we want an anchor we want stability in america we want to believe in the right things what are the right things to believe in we want to raise our future families right how do we find out what we need to know who will tell us we need leadership but we also want to be respected we know americas in trouble we want to help but we dont know what to do how do we fix it
4456019 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
4456020 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
4456021 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
4456022 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
4456023 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
4456024 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
4456025 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
4456026 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
4456027 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
4456028 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
4456029 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
4456030 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
4456031 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
4456032 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
4456033 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
4456034 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
4456035 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
4456036 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
4456037 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
4456038 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
4456039 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
4456040 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
4456041 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
4456042 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
4456043 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
4456044 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
4456045 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
4456046 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
4456047 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
4456048 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
4456049 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
4456050 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
4456051 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
4456052 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
4456053 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
4456054 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
4456055 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
4456056 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
4456057 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
4456058 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
4456059 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
4456060 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
4456061 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
4456062 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
4456063 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
4456064 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
4456065 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
4456066 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
4456067 a rather typical pump and dump scheme in the world of the high risk penny stock investor
4456068 t his case represents another example where the guidelines in a securities fraud prosecution have so run amok that they are patently absurd on their face
4456069 although the parrises criminal conduct was reprehensible they were simply not in the same league as the likes of the enron worldcom and computer associates defendants
4456070 i refuse to participate or cooperate in any way in your criminal and cowardly fascist racketeering conspiracy otherwise known as the murder me legally game go to hell
4456071 a hitlerite decision a fascist decision you leave me only my absolute moral superiority that i invoke against you and your co conspirators go to hell

4456095 chen added i can not believe any nation would take discrimination of appearance as its interest more gold medalists in olympic games is also in the national interest should our athletes use stimulants in order to archieve this interest
4456096 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4456097 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4456098 i am well aware that the orthodox opinion is that six million jews were gassed and cremated and turned into lampshades orthodox opinion also once held that the world is flat i have reached the conclusion that the extermination tale is a mixture of allied wartime propaganda extremely profitable lie and latter witch hysteria

4456110 just because theyre pretty much household names it doesnt mean their it department is completely organized
4456111 some have a very good quality assurance department others have a very good development organization but that doesnt mean everything is moving along in a precise fashion
4456112 for a long time the approach was lets just throw some code together because all these new languages like c and java were coming out and they were supposed to make development easier
4456113 enterprises fell victim to the false promises of the web making things easier
4456114 it did but it also made things far more complex you need more system integration use cases and testing

4456118 the idea that working with the kernel community is hard to me is a myth or at least a misconception
4456119 it is only hard if you dont take the time to learn how the community works
4456120 whenever you step into a large organized operation there are going to be some ground rules and if you ignore those rules you will find working with the community very hard

4456127 the number of people in need of food assistance continues to escalate
4456128 during these humanitarian relief operations the united states expects russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open
4456129 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4456130 the expectation was that our two nations despite our differences shared areas of common interest where we could work together as real partners
4456131 has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4456132 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4456133 weve also canceled a u s canadian russian exercise vigilant eagle that was to have begun on aug 20

4456136 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4456137 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4456138 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4456139 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4456140 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4456141 that was heat of the moment stuff he hit it right at me
4456142 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its part of the game you were on top of the game
4456143 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4456144 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4456145 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4456146 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4456147 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4456148 if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4456149 musharraf has been seeking safe passage for a long time but we oppose it the man who subverted the constitution must be impeached and tried we want to set an example for the future
4456150 but we cannot block safe passage to musharraf because we are not at the helm of affairs
4456151 the motion for musharrafs impeachment would be introduced in the national assembly on monday
4456152 we have also heard reports that musharraf would resign before the impeachment process is started however we have been instructed to proceed on the assumption that he will fight the impeachment

4456158 theyre very active and very sincere folks but some of the people i talked with didnt even know what precinct they vote in
4456159 all of a sudden theyre active good im glad but some might say they should not start at the top
4456160 too many times we only hear about the negative news of our world that extends to truck drivers who are truly misunderstood for the role they play in moving freight from the factories to our homes
4456161 we see todays truck driver as the brave men and women who make our highways safer and drive our economy they truly are americas unsung heroes and we want to honor them
4456162 the highway hero program is for those who selflessly risk life and limb to come to the aid of fellow motorists or who make the world a better place for all anyone can nominate a truck driver for this high honor
4456163 a lot of this is coming to completion after a good deal of work and i look forward to go to libya

4456177 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interests
4456178 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4456179 to begin to repair its relations with the united states and europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors

4456181 we continue to believe that enzo with its first mover reach into most major chinese cities and the appeal of its product lines for increasingly affluent and style conscious women places us in a strong position to profit from chinas rapid economic growth we also believe that continuing to increase the chinese share of our sales will help us overcome the weakness in our north american market and resume our historically robust growth next year
4456182 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4456183 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4456184 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4456185 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4456186 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4456187 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4456188 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4456189 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4456190 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach

4456195 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4456196 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4456197 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4456198 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4456199 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4456200 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4456201 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4456202 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4456203 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4456204 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4456205 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4456206 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4456207 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4456208 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4456209 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4456210 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4456211 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4456212 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4456213 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4456214 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4456215 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4456216 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4456217 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4456218 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4456219 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4456220 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4456221 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4456222 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4456223 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4456224 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4456225 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4456226 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4456227 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4456228 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4456229 for 50 years lan has strived to redefine the standard of air travel in south america our financial strength and our reputation for being a leader in providing customers with the best in flight experience is reflected in our award winning service and passenger preference for lan

4456249 now there is a free program in spanish to help negotiate reasonable balances and payment plans the anxiety so many victims of hospital price gouging face is being replaced with real concern real help real discounts and real solutions for these patients
4456250 depression and anxiety disorders tend to have a chronic unremitting course
4456251 so prevention of relapse is as important as lifting patients out of an acute episode
4456252 it helps you step back from automatic reactions built into emotions for evolutionary reasons

4456257 bij het huidige grote media aanbod hebben mensen behoefte aan een gids die het kaf van het koren scheidt we willen nog duidelijker en nadrukkelijker een selectie bieden zonder aan diepgang in te boeten
4456258 de advertentiemarkt voor sport is nog niet geheel volgroeid sportwereld pro haalde een oplage van 100 000 exemplaren
4456259 als ze meer aan promotie hadden gedaan dan hadden ze meer lezers gehad en was de advertentiemarkt enthousiaster geweest het ligt niet aan de kwaliteit van de krant die is gewoon goed
4456260 je moet sponsors de tijd gunnen om aan een nieuwe krant te wennen
4456261 sponsoring werkt pas als je het ondersteunt in de rest van je communicatie
4456262 je kunt breed in de kranten of op tv adverteren en niemand bereiken de media zijn versplinterd vroeger was een spotje op nederland 1 en 2 plus een rondje landelijke dagbladen voldoende om het hele land te bereiken
4456263 je moet de klant anders aanspreken je naam op de muts van schaatser sven kramer dat komt over of op het shirt van huntelaar
4456264 kijk naar de kpn telecompetitie of het wielrennen lezers vinden de aanwezigheid van sponsors doodnormaal in de sport
4456265 wij moeten ons de vraag stellen hoe we op de lange termijn onze manier van journalistiek gaan financieren
4456266 inkomsten uit traditionele advertenties en abonnementen gaan achteruit redactioneel commerci le samenwerking is een antwoord wij zijn nu bezig met verkenningen waaraan we vijf jaar geleden niet moesten denken
4456267 je moet blijven afvragen of we zonder sponsoring evenveel aandacht zouden geven aan een evenement
4456268 hier kennen we niet de sportbeleving die je ziet in spanje of itali op een gegeven moment ben je klaar met het sportnieuws en moet je derderangs onderwerpen behandelen daar zitten lezers niet op te wachten
4456269 als sportliefhebber vind ik het jammer dat ad sportwereld pro stopt
4456270 maar als baas van sportweek vind ik het geweldig de krant is toch een concurrent
4456271 deze aanbestedingsprocedure is illustratief voor elk nieuw te bouwen prominent openbaar gebouw in nederland
4456272 het zijn nu eens niet de europese regels die het probleem zijn maar de angstige manier waarop nederlandse opdrachtgevers die interpreteren
4456273 de bedoeling van die europese aanbesteding was juist om de markt voor meer architecten open te gooien juist ook voor kleine en beginnende bureaus nu gebeurt het tegenovergestelde gemeenten zijn bang te worden teruggefloten en gaan van de weeromstuit op safe spelen
4456274 je krijgt alleen maar grote bureaus die steeds maar hetzelfde doen door dit risico mijdende gedrag worden verrassende idee n a priori uitgesloten en krijgen jonge en kleine bureaus geen kans te laten zien wat ze kunnen terwijl nederland juist met zijn architectuur furore heeft gemaakt door open te staan voor nieuw talent
4456275 het gaat om een opdracht van 90 miljoen dan is het logisch dat we met een bureau in zee willen dat heeft bewezen dit aan te kunnen
4456276 maar die discussie moeten ze niet met de opdrachtgever voeren maar met europa
4456277 een mooi gebouw hoeft niet per se duur te zijn dit budget is toereikend voor hoogwaardige architectuur je kunt niet beweren dat wij hiermee het vak van de architect uithollen
4456278 de prijzen van grondstoffen zijn zo omhooggegaan en personeel is zo schaars dat het oorspronkelijke budget niet meer toereikend is
4456279 we got all those runs near the beginning of the game soi should have been able to go out there and get outs at a better pace but i wasnt able to
4456280 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4456281 we believe there is much more going on than protests
4456282 we are here to reach out to denver to tell them about something else
4456283 politicians respond to pressure and there needs to be a nonviolent movement applying this pressure
4456284 we really want to elevate public dialogue about faith based issues
4456285 we need to steer the country in a way that will result in peace justice and a sustainable environment
4456286 every day of the iraq war costs us 84 elementary schools
4456287 looking ahead to the conventions we had finally hit on the formula that integrated msnbc and nbc news the guy we were going to lean on was tim russert i think wed be best advised to take that time we were going to give to tim and just be silent in his memory i dont know what were going to do without him i mean that in the philosophical way but also practically speaking
4456288 we used to consider ourselves gavel to gavel that doesnt make sense any more for lots of reasons were not cspan they perform a public service but we provide more than that
4456289 my biggest fear is somehow it is marred by something unpredicted
4456290 well do our best to cover dissenting voices but we hope any protests will be done in way we can be proud of everyones a little nervous

4456296 shes 100 per cent healthy its no problem with her health she did feel some pressure earlier in the year but shes physically fitter than ever
4456297 i had a good start and was 5 9 seconds faster than hirvonen on the first stage i really pushed hard
4456298 at the moment everything is okay we are happy and will keep on pushing
4456299 it is difficult to drive on the dirty road it was better in ss2 and i had a better feeling with the car for me though the soft tyres were not the right choice
4456300 it went well apart from a small amount of understeer
4456301 it was slippery in the narrow sections and where the surface changes especially on the opening stage and i dont think ive ever been as sideways on asphalt as i was this morning

4456304 this is brilliant news for chris who continues to go from strength to strength in the sport
4456305 his success is an inspiration to everyone in scotland and shows our athletes can compete at the highest level on the world stage
4456306 its just so phenomenal what the whole gb team has achieved and to get a gold medal from chris hoy on the first day on the track is just absolutely inspirational and we are looking forward to his next two events
4456307 i think for scottish cycling the future is looking really healthy
4456308 to win as part of a team is a totally different feeling from the 1km time trial in athens
4456309 our friendship has been so dominant in the last few years as part of a team you cant let anyone down
4456310 to beat them by half a second made it that exciting honestly it took every inch of effort in beating the french who have been invincible
4456311 the french have been so dominant we have really put all the pieces of the jigsaw together we really focused on the details to stick half a second into them its amazing
4456312 it hasnt sunk in yet its weird but mostly exciting
4456313 we were very disappointed after athens ive given absolutely everything i could into it and it paid off
4456314 my job title should really be travel agent i need a break from these marathon work days would like to actually see calcutta while here

4456361 help help here is something new which i have never seen before woe is me
4456362 i decided to take these two weeks off from tournament golf as with automatic qualification now out of the question i thought it very important to put in some serious practice time so i am ready to perform to the best of my ability should i come into the reckoning for a captains selection
4456363 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared towards qualifying but i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it to the requisite 14 and a half points
4456364 hopefully the crowds will inspire me to a great week it will be a really strong tournament with so many european players in the field battling to improve their positions on the european ryder cup rankings in the final qualifying event
4456365 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it
4456366 i think the whole of formula 1 is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there
4456367 we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit
4456368 with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful
4456369 we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle
4456370 its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
4456371 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia said the brazilian
4456372 despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels
4456373 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up
4456374 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team setanta readers comment of the day

4456422 estas leyes adem s de haber sido legisladas a trav s de una procedimiento muy discutible pues la asamblea nacional se desprendi de su tarea esencial de hacer leyes innova en una serie de delitos que extralimitan aun m s esa mal entendida competencia dada al poder ejecutivo
4456423 se han dispuesto una serie de nuevos delitos se han reagrupado otros que ya exist an y se ha creado un marco jur dico punitivo sancionatorio con consecuencias graves sobre la libertad e inevitablemente sobre la econom a y sociedad misma porque se regulan cosas la posibilidad de inhabilitarte comercialmente hasta diez a os luego de ya haber cumplido una condena
4456424 son leyes draconianas con sanciones m ltiples penas sever simas son penas inconstitucionales exageradas es una extralimitaci n de la funci n reguladora o legislativa dada el ejecutivo adem s son extempor neas nos sit an en la poca del imperio romano
4456425 le ley indica que las penas de prisi n las impondr n los jueces pero en el an lisis de los delitos entre las sanciones administrativas de repente aparecen penas de prisi n las multas las pone el ente con competencia pero y si el juez te dice que eres inocente c mo queda una sanci n previa quedar amos en la situaci n de que no se puede castigar dos veces a una misma persona o deben fijarse como hechos diferentes debe delimitarse si son il citos administrativos y crear un tipo penal para conductas agravadas
4456426 el problema de t cnica legislativa es atroz y eso generar problemas en la pr ctica
4456427 sin tantos controles el mercado es el primer mecanismo preventivo y sancionatorio pues quien se salga de los precios del mercado nadie le compra as de simple

4456503 we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control i have urged all chief ministers to improve and strengthen the pds to ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at reasonable prices the reserve bank of india is moderating the growth of money supply in the country so that inflation can be controlled however while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our growth

4456550 cresterea economica din primul trimestru a fost de 6 1 fata de anul anterior multi polonezi care au plecat la lucru in marea britanie si irlanda s au intors acasa atrasi de salariile mai mari somajul care era de 20 in 2003 aproape a disparut in anumite zone ale tarii
4456551 guvernul s a descurcat surprinzator de bine in refacerea echilibrului macroeconomic dupa ce in ultimii zece ani cheltuielile si imprumuturile publice aproape au dus la un dezastru
4456552 economia ungariei si a mai revenit insa inflatia se mentine la un nivel preocupant de peste 6 intrebarea este daca guvernul va avea puterea sa aplice din nou politici fiscale stranse
4456553 le conflit latent entre la russie et la g orgie sest transform en guerre
4456554 in the last two weeks many of us have learned that tskhinvali is the capital of south ossetia that south ossetia is a region a bit bigger than luxembourg that is legally part of georgia but ruled de facto by moscow that the guy who formally replaced putin is dmitry medvedev that the president of georgia mikhail saakashvili has two
4456555 the cartoon images have shown russia as an angry bear stretching out a claw to maul georgia russia is certainly angry and like a beast provoked has bared its teeth but it is the wrong stereotype what the world has seen last week is a brilliant and brutal display of russias national game chess and moscow has just declared checkmate
4456556 the consequences of this egregious error begin in georgia itself not only is it now defenceless it can kiss goodbye to any restoration of sovereignty over both south ossetia and abkhazia even though french president nicolas sarkozy received tentative agreement from both moscow and tbilisi for the establishment of international talks to settle the status of the two areas they are unlikely to rejoin georgia any time soon the loss of abkhazia with its considerable economic potential is a huge blow the european union and the united states will argue there is no parallel to be drawn between kosovo and the georgian breakaway regions but that is not how much of the world including china south africa and indonesia see it and it is certainly not how russia sees it the first chickens of kosovos independence are coming home to roost
4456557 the latest conflict is humiliating for the us but it may have saved us from a far more catastrophic future namely an offer of nato membership to georgia and ukraine provoking conflicts with russia in which the west would be legally committed to come to these countries aid

4456562 i feel like a different person when i wear my uniform and walk among civilians at a red light a middle aged man made me roll down my window just to tell me that my uniform makes me look amazing that really made my day
4456563 they have money but little job satisfaction they envy me my work and lifestyle after five years in the army i am in a position where i am managing human resources to the tune of 500 personnel and equipment worth crores at 29 years of age most of my school and college friends have yet to make a mark for themselves in their careers
4456564 work in civvie street comes with issues like professional back stabbing monotony and no support systems i worked in the pharmaceutical industry for a short period before getting selected for the army and i know that i could not have survived in that environment for too long
4456565 the only thing that would make my life better is a permanent commission by the time i complete my term i will be 38 and without pensionary benefits i will have to start a new career as a civilian
4456566 perks aside the cash component should be increased if the army has to draw its fair share of talent from the nations youth pool talent has to be bought at the market price

4456585 now for the first time world jewry openly says what it wants germany must die
4456586 and you can read the jews solution in the booklet
4456587 you must ensure through your behavior that jewry never again has even the slightest influence on our people
4456588 you say that religion is a private matter but you fight against the jewish religion
4456589 actually the jewish religion is nothing other than a doctrine to preserve the jewish race
4456590 in resisting all government attempts to nationalize them the jews build a state within the state count helmuth von moltke
4456591 to call this state a religion was one of the cleverest tricks ever invented
4456592 from this first lie that jewry is a religion not a race further lies inevitably follow
4456593 this little phrase after all proves that they are rare exceptions of no significance to our battle against jewry as a whole
4456594 know dear christian and have no doubts about it that next to the devil you have no more bitter poisonous and determined enemy than a genuine jew if they do something good for you it is not because they love you but because they need room to live with us so they have to do something but their heart remains as i have said
4456595 that speaks against the jews not for them the fact that one calls the crooks among us white jews is proof that being a jew implies something bad otherwise one would call crooked jews yellow christians the fact that there are so many white jews among us proves that the destructive jewish spirit has already infected wide circles of our population it is a warning to us that we have to take up the battle against the jewish world plague everywhere
4456596 the party battles the jewish materialistic spirit within and outside of us
4456597 mr levi is not a jew since he has been baptized
4456598 are these long noses a kind of uniform that allows the god king jehovah to recognize his old body guard even if they have deserted
4456599 in case of need a dose of baptismal water saves both business and jewry at the same time
4456600 it is true that mr moses freundenstein is a jew but his parents and grandparents lived here he is one of our old established citizens
4456601 of course the jew is a human being too none of us has ever doubted it but a flea is also an animal but not a very pleasant one since a flea is not a pleasant animal we have no duty to protect and defend it to take care of it so that it can bite and torment and torture us rather we make it harmless it is the same with the jews
4456602 can you live with the uproar and accept responsibility for the misery that the laws of the third reich bring to thousands of jewish families
4456603 it is almost a miracle that absolutely nothing has happened to jews in germany but rather that only gradually the rights they stole from the germans in politics and culture have been restored
4456604 sonderdienst der rpl issue 20 43 it provides extensive material on the jewish question
4456605 it interesting to see you dance to the music of your jewish masters but its a good thing that the english people are finally recognizing the slumbering jewish danger in its midst i hope the knowledge continues to grow
4456606 i do not know your nationality but as long as you live in england enjoy englands protection and are paid in english currency you should try to be english its enough that england was forced into this war against its will which serves no other purpose than to protect jewish financial interests i hope that anti semitism takes hold everywhere in england for too long jewish finance jewish speculation and jewish financial criminals and war profiteers have controlled us the jews in england have become a plague in the future our government should offer them no protection and no entrance visas as a race the jews are cowardly dirty unpatriotic and egocentric we know only too well that our sons are fighting for jewish england and that they are cannon fodder for the jews
4456607 are you a jew yourself or is there some special reason why you dance to the jewish tune the sooner hitler destroys those 5 million jews the better off the world will be let us lift our glasses and drink to the day that there are no jews left in the world
4456608 dont you have anything better to do than to waste valuable paper by defending a human race that sees earning money as the only thing that is worthwhile the jews exploit englands hospitality one almost wants to ask how much the chief rabbi paid you to write your article
4456609 christianity teaches that the jews are good for nothing the jewish religion however teaches that they are the chosen people to whom one day all the other peoples will be subordinate such a doctrine raises our suspicions since the jews are systematically raised to be arrogant is no surprise that no one likes them
4456610 the growing opposition to the jews in england can be traced to the poor
4456611 a telephone call from london can lead to the manufacture of a certain machine part formerly made in germany in some country on the other side of the world the affected firm in germany thus loses what may have been its best customer we give germany as an example since it best demonstrates the results if this action is multiplied the country soon has no trade with its neighbors but instead suffers under growing debt piled on it by the same profit hungry usurious financial figures the suffering country has no other choice but self reliance a noble goal but one that the financiers hate since it robs them of lucrative business the suffering country uses its raw materials for its own purposes and it is understandable that it builds a reserve of war materials in case it is attacked by countries controlled by monopoly finance as long as there are two competing financial systems in the world there will always be potential cause for war between the respective nations
4456612 we are the ones who incite world wars and the main beneficiaries of such wars
4456613 it cannot go on like this if a new world war does not break out in the near future 150 000 or 200 000 jews will have to emigrate
4456614 the jewish question is being discussed by statesmen in a way more acute and compelling than ever before in the history of the world they can do whatever they want but the nations of the earth well never be able to get away from this question the jewish serpent will show its hydras heads everywhere blocking the way to a relaxation of international tensions we jews will not allow peace in the world however hard statesmen and peace advocates try to bring it about
4456615 hitler does not want war but he will be forced into it england will have the last word just as it did in 1914
4456616 we are convinced that at the end of the war jewry will face a humanity that fully understands the jewish question
4456617 anti semitism is spreading like poison in the whole body politic
4456618 i speak prophetically just as the discovery that the earth moved around the sun led to a complete transformation of the way people looked at the world so too the blood and racial teachings of national socialism will change our understanding of mankinds past and its future
4456619 one forgets today that the human race is a single large and catholic race
4456620 the divine is in me i am a part of it i can recognize gods will without the help of priests
4456621 what is the essential trait of jewry practicality self interest what is the culture of the jew haggling what is his god money
4456622 what we require is simple that we control everything necessary for our own good
4456623 no one may be indifferent to the racial principle the racial question it is the key to world history history is often confusing because it is written by people who did not understand the racial question and the aspects relevant to it race is everything and every race that does not keep its blood from being mixed will perish language and religion do not determine a race blood determines it
4456624 it is time for italians to openly affirm racial thinking italian racial policy must be italian in nature and follow the aryan nordic model
4456625 it is necessary to make a clear distinction between the mediterranean peoples of europe on the one side and the oriental and african peoples on the other
4456626 the pure european physical and spiritual traits of the italians may not be altered the pure european character of the italians will be changed by mixing with any other non european race which is the carrier of a culture other than the ancient aryan culture
4456627 the human soul does not exist independent of the body as the church teaches body and soul are an inseparable unity the living body is the manifestation of the soul
4456628 each manifestation of the people depends on the individual and the family the heath and vitality of a people and the extent and degree of its culture depends on whether there are sufficient racially valuable groups the individual and the government have a common task which they can only meet together keeping these racially valuable groups and families pure adolf hitler has led the german people to the realization that the nordic race is the most creative valuable race on earth it has determined their nature their culture and their history therefore caring for the valuable nordic blood is their most important task each of us has a role a consciousness of our proud ancestry must be the guiding force in our behavior we do not want to be the last of a millennia old advanced culture that ends with us but rather members of an unending chain extending from our most ancient ancestors to our distant grandchildren heinrich himmler
4456629 were not real big on pointing fingers or attaching blame or airing this out in public
4456630 the presidential campaigns of senators barack obama and john mccain are volleying back and forth with innovative internet and mobile communications with the expectation that technology may help decide who wins the presidency this november

4456635 katrina has influenced my artwork exponentially its basically my jumping off point
4456636 it is something i knew id have to deal with in rebuilding my life
4456637 he told me if i could put anything together theyd look at it
4456638 it was great to be making art again but i didnt know where i wanted to go with it i wanted to do something pertaining to katrina but i was so angry
4456639 when i came to iowa state i wanted to make work that would help me cope with the aftermath of hurricane katrina i was looking for closure from what i had just been through the emotional and psychological toll that my mind and body endured after katrina left me questioning everything i had ever learned the world seemed to be flipped on its axis and i felt as though i was free falling out of control the ease at which everything i owned was destroyed left me sick to my stomach at times the total lack of respect for human life at the hands of the united states government during hurricane katrina is something i will never forget
4456640 it has the appearance of function but it doesnt actually work thats my critique of the government after katrina
4456641 the dome represents the superdome and its legs are modeled after crawfish the factory denotes new orleans shipping yard the back hoe is the destruction and recovery of the city and the water tower sits on an oil rig structure representing the special interests
4456642 it takes four people to operate the real point is to get people to work together towards a common goal to encourage community
4456643 three of the four stations are dependent upon each other to work properly
4456644 katrina was a life changing experience and i plan on drawing inspiration from it probably for the rest of my life
4456645 but the theme wont be katrina my artwork will be geared toward community getting people involved actively participating i want to stay on the theme of multiple people activating one sculpture
4456646 the people are so glad they have this soccer field again
4456647 before the reopening it seemed like everywhere i went somebody would always mention it to me and tell me how excited they were about the reopening soccer brings everybody together regardless of their age

4456666 it is increasingly difficult to demonstrate that buying a renewable electricity tariff is offering additional carbon emissions reductions
4456667 businesses signed up to green tariffs based on the evidence available at the time but their choices have been producing only limited additional renewable generation capacity
4456668 many companies bought these tariffs in good faith but there are no guarantees that they actually save carbon they didnt pay much of a premium for the carbon savings they could claim in their marketing statements so they have basically been given a free ride
4456669 theyre worried about being ranked badly nobody wants to come bottom of a table of their peers
4456670 this is a serious problem for a number of companies who have followed the governments guidelines and gone out and purchased green electricity and are now being told that green source is no longer valid
4456671 no creo que robinho se niegue a ir a valencia
4456672 preguntad a robinho si est contento o no yo estoy contento de tenerle todos los d as porque para mi es un grand simo futbolista y ojal que no se vaya soy ego sta pero cada uno defiende sus intereses pelea por lo suyo y tanto el futbolista como la instituci n se tienen que poner de acuerdo
4456673 no lo veo triste no tengo ni idea si se va a negar a ir a valencia robinho es un chico inteligente y no creo que vaya a negar a esas cosas
4456674 en primer lugar no es que el club no me dej a los juegos o a una convocatoria de tu selecci n vas si quieres y yo ya lo ten a decidido de antes
4456675 tuve la suerte de ganar unos juegos y decid que este a o necesitaba otras cosas nunca renunciar a mi selecci n y no es que mi club no me dejara se opt por el camino de hablar de la paciencia hablaron las dos partes tambi n conmigo y se decidi lo mejor para los tres
4456676 por supuesto que me hubiera gustado estar pero tambi n necesitaba un par n estoy tranquilo porque s que argentina va a volver a conseguir ganar porque tiene un equipo b rbaro disfruto vi ndolo por televisi n
4456677 parece que la de valencia ser una pista incre ble
4456678 disfruto visitando nuevos circuitos y estoy deseando meterme en el coche parece que ser una pista incre ble de todas formas ir a un nuevo circuito no cambia mis preparativos todo el mundo est en la misma situaci n as que no lo trato de forma muy diferente
4456679 la carrera de hungr a demostr lo impredecible que puede ser la f rmula 1 y sa es una de las razones por las que es un deporte fascinante est claro sin embargo que a n estoy en buena posici n para luchar por el t tulo
4456680 2007 fue muy intenso y la consistencia era muy importante este a o los resultados de todos han sido m s variados y todo piloto que ha ganado una carrera tambi n se ha visto incapaz de conseguir puntos en al menos otras dos ocasiones
4456681 eso hace que conseguir buenos resultados sea a n m s importante pero creo que veremos que la consistencia se hace crucial a medida que avanzamos hacia el final de la temporada
4456682 mejorando y aprendiendo m s del equipo y del coche en cada carrera
4456683 mi objetivo para la ltima parte de la temporada es ganar m s carreras y estar habitualmente entre los primeros es algo que he podido hacer algunas veces en la primera mitad del a o pero ahora me siento m s seguro de poder estar regularmente entre los primeros en las pr ximas carreras
4456684 te acostumbras a que los circuitos urbanos son lentos con muchas curvas lentas y medias y rectas muy cortas pero este es casi lo contrario
4456685 es demasiado pronto para decir si habr oportunidades de adelantamiento
4456686 pero hay un par de horquillas donde podr a ser posible

4456688 results 1 10 of about 28 400 000 sites for dogs
4456689 you wear them close to your skin so you wash them more and they dont have that long of a shelf life
4456690 go for a good fit first and for fabric that doesnt look flimsy
4456691 a great bra can make a 5 to 10 pound difference in your appearance
4456692 the bigger your bust the more important the fit is if you have a smaller chest a quality bra can make the most of what you have
4456693 and investing in a good pair is smart as the wear and tear on them is typically greater than on most wardrobe items
4456694 spend more on at least one pair of well tailored tropical wool black pants
4456695 a very good jacket can do a lot for your overall look
4456696 you could wear just a t shirt and jeans but an expensive fabulous jacket upgrades your outfit
4456697 a dark dress in black or some deep shade of brown or a jewel tone is something to spend a bit more on
4456698 a black suit should be a staple of any womans wardrobe
4456699 if you can afford it i would absolutely encourage buying one pair of really good shoes per season
4456700 dont pay full price how much wear will you really get out of it
4456701 its not worth it to go out and buy an expensive clutch youre not going to use every day
4456702 go to a thrift store and buy a vintage bag for the evening
4456703 some of the newer microfiber coats work really well and are reasonably priced
4456704 a good coat is an essential wrapper for all your wardrobe choices
4456705 it must really fit and the fabric must be of a caliber that will withstand heavy wear and wont wrinkle
4456706 this is the mark of a coat that fits well
4456707 if it looks like a crumpled lunch bag so will you
4456708 it looks like he had a belly suit on and then a day later he takes it off and theres a slim guy underneath it really pisses me off
4456709 when im craving chocolate i have a chocolate coated energy bar or another similar protein bar for 210 calories ive gotten to the point where that tastes like candy to me
4456710 he feels okay maybe even good and really enjoys that steak
4456711 when women start a diet they go from zero to 100 they become perfect overnight which is a hallmark of failure thats why i developed the 80 rule hit your weight loss goals 80 every single day you can one day itll be 120 because it happens to be a great day other days youll hit 50 or even 20 when youre dealing with pms just make sure it averages out to 80
4456712 when a guy goes to the gym hell usually pick an exercise that allows him to use the most impressive looking weights
4456713 a woman on the other hand will go for light dumbbells and do an exercise that allows her to use perfect form but will do the least amount of good

4456769 when we sin and desire forgiveness a broken heart and a contrite spirit mean to experience godly sorrow that worketh repentance 2 corinthians 7 10 this comes when our desire to be cleansed from sin is so consuming that our hearts ache with sorrow and we yearn to feel at peace with our father in heaven those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit are willing to do anything and everything that god asks of them without resistance or resentment we cease doing things our way and learn to do them gods way instead in such a condition of submissiveness the atonement can take effect and true repentance can occur the penitent will then experience the sanctifying power of the holy ghost which will fill them with peace of conscience and the joy of reconciliation with god in a wondrous union of divine attributes the same god who teaches us to walk with a broken heart invites us to rejoice and to be of good cheer

4456821 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4456822 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4456823 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4456824 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4456825 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4456826 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4456827 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4456828 its amazing that shes had something stolen but yet she is the one who has to pay out

4456831 stolen vehicles are a danger to public safety often defective or damaged and likely to be re stolen or destroyed
4456832 all stolen or suspected stolen vehicles found abandoned in suffolk are removed by approved vehicle recovery operators vros contracted by suffolk constabulary to ensure prompt recovery to a secure location where they may be forensically examined
4456833 any vehicle removed under statutory powers will be at the owners expense for this there is a statutory fee of 105
4456834 once the vehicle is released after being examined and the owner is notified of this by either the vro or the constabularys vehicle recovery liaison officer the owner will be liable for a fee for every further day that it remains in storage
4456835 de qu forma se pueden acercar usuarios y de qu forma se puede poner finalmente operativa esta herramienta
4456836 nos preocupa mucho la inactividad del puerto como la carencia de algunas obras de estructura propias del predio de la zona franca y las limitaciones que tiene la ley que rige la zona franca
4456837 con estas carencias por m s que est habilitada la zona franca y en un esquema econ mico que no es el ideal va a ser muy dif cil hacerla funcionar en los t rminos que queremos hacerlo
4456838 impulsar un proyecto que sea importante para la provincia y que funcione
4456839 hubo acuerdo en impulsar en com n las gestiones para favorecer el funcionamiento de la zona franca
4456840 hab amos recibido una suerte de cr tica y quer amos aclararla
4456841 nos consideramos gente seria que hemos invertido sanamente que hemos cre do en este proyecto hemos puesto un gran esfuerzo para hacerlo funcionar y venimos a decirles que no por voluntad nuestra que la zona franca hoy no est funcionando
4456842 es la primera reuni n oficial de los empresarios que tienen a su cargo la concesi n de la zona franca de la provincia de entre r os con las autoridades m ximas del poder ejecutivo as que es un buen paso que era necesario darlo
4456843 hay otras zonas francas de nuestro pa s que est n operando y con buen xito
4456844 dada la ubicaci n de nuestra zona franca y lo que est recibiendo como inversiones nuestra provincia creemos que es una herramienta muy importante
4456845 hay que poner a punto algunos detalles para que est a disposici n de estos empresarios que ven con buenos ojos a entre r os para hacer sus inversiones
4456846 faltar an algunas peque as obras y poner operadores comerciales que atiendan y salgan a buscar los clientes
4456847 una nueva actitud frente al conflicto ofrece la posibilidad de una nueva respuesta
4456848 el estado provincial promueve y fomenta la comunicaci n la utilizaci n difusi n y desarrollo de la instancia de resoluci n pac fica de las controversias la mediaci n negociaci n conciliaci n facilitaci n
4456849 el tema de fondo ni en los contenidos de los ocho proyectos como tampoco un juicio de valor porque quien puede negar la importancia de lo que es el pre mbulo
4456850 lo que no est prohibido est permitido el obst culo es que la 9768 en su art culo 4 define que la convenci n no podr apartarse de la competencia de la presente ley
4456851 no hubo una omisi n sino una voluntad del legislador entrerriano que al momento de acordar los temas no incluy el pre mbulo y ese silencio no puede interpretarse como una autorizaci n
4456852 el dictado de un pre mbulo no constituye un acto de gobierno sino el ejercicio de las funciones que le son propias para insertar un plexo que forma parte de la letra constitucional
4456853 de ninguna manera la 9768 coarta la posibilidad al constituyente de prologar la constituci n de la provincia un pre mbulo es el corolario y lo que explica el esp ritu de quienes hacemos esta tarea que nos compromete con el futuro
4456854 no voy a dejar una brecha abierta para que se entienda que discutimos la forma cuando en realidad lo que subyace es el fondo
4456855 trabajar sobre aspectos legales y no sobre actos reclamativos o de deseos
4456856 esta discusi n establece un marco de posibilidades y cierra o abre los debates de acuerdo a que esas posibilidades est n o no autorizadas
4456857 entendemos y as lo se alamos antes de la selecciones que el tema no se encuentra habilitado por la ley de convocatoria y resulta de toda claridad que se encuentra expresamente prohibido
4456858 siendo el pre mbulo un texto integrativo del texto constitucional no podr tocarse si no est habilitado por la ley de la convocatoria
4456859 el primer argumento es literal y el otro si se quiere es m s interpretativo el literal no est prohibido y el pre mbulo no figura porque no puede reformarse lo que no existe
4456860 nunca vamos a poder poner un pre mbulo a n cuando se lo habilite porque nos van a decir que no se puede comprender el esp ritu del 33 y a adi
4456861 qui n si no somos nosotros ser capaz de hacer un pre mbulo
4456862 el pueblo nos dio mandato para la reforma dentro de determinados l mites no discutimos acerca del pre mbulo como una cuesti n ideol gica sino si es un tema habilitado o no
4456863 preceptivo y si no lo es no tuvo por qu estar en la ley de convocatoria
4456864 fija los l mites del poder constituyente pero el pre mbulo no es constituci n no forma parte de ella y no est incorporado al articulado
4456865 la ley de reforma se hubiera metido en los poderes propios de los constituyentes
4456866 el pre mbulo es una resoluci n de la convenci n no un art culo y as como establece su presupuesto y mecanismos puede por la misma v a t cnica establecer un pre mbulo el pre mbulo a nadie obliga el pre mbulo no es una norma
4456867 un pre mbulo tiene sentido si hacemos uno de nuestros tiempos que rompa los moldes que defina nuestra historia y con ideolog a peronista y que hable de un dios reparador es nsito al poder de la convenci n establecer un pre mbulo que prologue o sea colof n de la constituci n
4456868 no es un poema pico todos los pre mbulos determinan los principios fundamentales que luego desarrolla el contenido normativo de la constituci n
4456869 tenemos que interpretar la norma sin que nos tiemble la decisi n de hacerlo
4456870 no es f cil resolver estas cuestione sin caer en sofismas interminables
4456871 no hay unanimidad en el acierto o en el error
4456872 la suerte no est echada y quiero exhortar a todos para que viabilicemos un pre mbulo y lo hago porque conozco la apertura de coraz n de nuestros colegas si se hubiera aprobado la enmienda tendr amos quiz s la posibilidad
4456873 no permitamos que un rbol nos impida ver el bosque
4456874 que nos ataquen por el pre mbulo por inconstitucional nos hemos jugado por cuestiones m s espinosas
4456875 rech cese la incorporaci n al texto constitucional de un pre mbulo por no contar las iniciativas citadas con la habilitaci n legal correspondiente
4456876 art el estado provincial reconoce la salud como derecho humano fundamental de las personas y garantiza la promoci n protecci n recuperaci n y rehabilitaci n de la salud incluyendo el control de los riesgos biol gicos y socio ambientales de todas las personas desde su concepci n para prevenir la posibilidad de enfermedad o muerte por causas que se pueden evitar

4456935 one of the reasons for having hybrids is to reduce dependence on foreign oil
4456936 you dont want to substitute dependence on foreign oil with dependence on foreign materials for lithium ion batteries
4456937 other countries such as korea and japan have identified advanced battery research and production as competitive priorities we have to make sure not to cede that competitive race
4456938 if we rely on foreign sources for those products we still could in a sense be relying on foreign sources of energy
4456939 i was pleased with the way dossena and keane worked against standard liege but i know that they will both play better
4456940 they are both players with quality and they are both internationals so i am sure that they will improve
4456941 sometimes a player can come into a team and do well straight away but usually they need time to adjust
4456942 when we signed skrtel some people were saying he was not good enough after just one game but we all know of his quality now
4456943 lots of people were saying they should not sponsor us if they are doing things like this
4456944 there is no bigger issue for most liverpool fans than hillsborough and the sun and sensitivity was called for
4456945 we are all wanting jamie to win he is one of the best in the world at his game and we all want him to bring back a medal
4456946 if he brings back a medal i will put up a picture of him he has a massive chance and ill be watching him on the telly
4456947 its great that jamie can come down to show his support my mates are also encouraging me its fantastic

4456963 we inquired from minafet through the diaspora department whether we could be linked to the genocide survivors group who connected us to ibuka
4456964 we knew that there were so many genocide survivors and since we earn a salary we saw it prudent to part with some of it for the good of our needy people
4456965 i thank our brothers and sisters for the donation but most significantly for the compassionate heart they have shown us by visiting and encouraging the children it is a signal of solidarity and love it will add a lot to the people
4456966 i think the best solution is to build roads like the ones in europe that can accommodate all kinds of trucks
4456967 i do not think it will have an effect on us and besides it takes less than eight hours to adjust the axle load
4456968 this is likely to help in increasing the number of trips the trucks make because less time will be required for clearing
4456969 allowing you to attend political party meetings is not part of the national electoral commission responsibilities if you want to do so you would rather ask permission from that political party leader but not under our accreditation
4456970 knowing why rwandan mayors resign or appointed is not your mandate it is totally contrary with the upcoming parliamentary elections
4456971 recently one of the eu observers in the eastern province asked why that place was inhabited and the ethnic group dominating it this was not part of his activities
4456972 ideology is a very powerful weapon that i compare to a bomb the positive ideology of rpf gave birth to policies like decentralization and others that made rwandans be actors in the development of the nation
4456973 usually when a country comes from war genocide in rwandas case the economy may grow because of donations aid and grants and diminishes when some countries pull out but it was not the same case with rwanda her economic growth was sustained which i call a rwandan miracle
4456974 this positive ideology was in the minds of rpf members even before beginning the struggle that is why we have unique policies that have helped this nation grow in a tremendous way economically we have gacaca the umuvunyi ombudsman with others that converge together to create a secure environment
4456975 for reasons we all know our country will not join the free trade area this year as we are not in a position to do so
4456976 we consider that we are not in a position to join the free trade area as yet
4456977 in due time when all conditions that we consider as important are in place to set this step we will do so
4456978 we might live in camps and tents but to me this way of living is better than the one in tanzania
4456979 though we live in the forest we are happy because we know we sleep in peace even though we sleep in tents or outside we are sure of no disturbances it is not as it was in tanzania where we used to spend sleepless nights wandering up and down protecting our properties and lives
4456980 i have come to know that there is no place like home whatever you do and wherever you go home remains the best place says judith mukasine
4456981 we went to tanzania 12 years ago with the hope of achieving our dreams but only to lose even the little we had

4456984 we thought we would live a wealthy life in tanzania but instead to the contrary i have now realized that to achieve anything there has to be peace and security first and this is what we now have yes we sleep badly but we can at least work for something little with a peace of mind and no one to disturb you

4456996 the scariest moment is always before you start after that things can only get better
4456997 im sitting in a hotel room in germany in the middle of my summer tour with the tv news telling me that my is being torn to pieces
4456998 throughout this week i havent been able to stop watching the news ive never seen it like this before its never made me feel so naked isolated and angry
4456999 with the russians still being in gori there are reports that they have stopped fighting but you dont need to be killing a countrys people or its soldiers to paralyse it
4457000 you see gori is right in the middle of the only road that goes from west to east across georgia
4457001 its the road that my mum and brother need to travel on to catch their return flight out of tbilisi
4457002 georgia has always had shaky politics especially after the break up of the and the civil war that followed in the 90s
4457003 more recently things appeared to be getting better the economy was growing the major cities were starting to look cleaner electricity blackouts like the ones when i lived there were almost unheard of
4457004 for next year it seems it will be a little more difficult
4457005 we will examine the governments growth forecast which is now 1 2 percent in mid october based on the available data the risks have increased significantly

4457017 every time i touch the wall its a mystery until i look up
4457018 i think shes an amazing woman and an amazing competitor
4457019 i really admire her im not going to be swimming when im 40 no way
4457020 it felt really easy ive been working on my starts
4457021 my finish was horrible but hopefully by sunday i wont think about anything ill just do it
4457022 its going to be a fast final so ive really got to bring it each round
4457023 its obviously a very different format to have the finals in the morning and the heats at night i really want to make it through to the next round but once youre there its anyones game
4457024 trickett first recorded a sub 24 second time in a race against michael phelps in april 2007 but swimmings world governing body refused to ratify a world mark because it was a mixed gender race
4457025 i had a cold for a couple days and i didnt tell anyone i dont know how it got out
4457026 but its no big deal i had to go out there swim a good pace placed a good time and its just a matter of getting ready for the final
4457027 ryan cochrane of canada erased hacketts olympic record from athens two heats earlier finishing second overall in 14 40 84 yuri prilukov of russia was third and zhang lin of china fourth
4457028 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4457029 the world has shown a special fascination with phelps diet which counts an amazing 12 000 calories a day six times what a normal adult male eats
4457030 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4457031 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4457032 french media have focused on their own swimmer alain bernard who has one gold and one silver but has given phelps his due too
4457033 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4457034 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4457035 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4457036 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him
4457037 nowhere is swimming bigger than in australia and phelps has eclipsed the countrys own ian thorpe the
4457038 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4457039 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4457040 whose islam is the best i e who is a very good muslim
4457041 one who avoids harming the muslims with his tongue amp hands
4457042 theres no permanent effect but it can be very unpleasant
4457043 we want to encourage people to enjoy the outdoor experience and use our lakes we also want to inform people that like mosquitoes and ticks swimmers itch can come with the territory
4457044 i think the opportunity to spend a nice day like this out in a beautiful natural setting outweighs the slight risk of getting swimmers itch

4457054 hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a kafka with his trousers down but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn is like comparing a poem by heinrich heine with an advertising slogan for mcdonald s
4457055 this is some idiot who knows nothing about kafka but writes about him as if he did
4457056 we re talking about a writer whose psyche the experts have been so keen to decipher they have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote every insurance report he ever compiled looking for clues yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff
4457057 i don t remotely claim it s a discovery of mine but i was genuinely shocked when i first saw it because i had never seen it in any academic biography of kafka the experts conspiracy of censorship is entertainingly curious
4457058 at a minimum he is carrying out a direct challenge to khamenei and the old guard leadership

4457067 valencia wird immer f r eine provisorische rennstrecke angesehen dabei ist es viel eher ein permanenter stra enkurs der obendrein noch ziemlich schnell und fl ssig ist
4457068 das ist eine ganz andere geschichte als wir es bisher in monaco gewohnt waren
4457069 auf dieser strecke haben bereits einige rennen mit sportwagen und der spanischen formel 3 stattgefunden wir haben also von diesen l ufen einige informationen aufgesaugt um schon vor dem eigentlichen rennwochenende etwas ber valencia zu lernen dort braucht es wohl mittleren bis wenig abtrieb und es gibt eine ganze reihe schneller kurven die eine sehr herausfordernde strecke in einer aufregenden umgebung ausmachen
4457070 einer der hauptaspekte wird sein dass es sicherlich ziemlich windig sein wird
4457071 aus diesem grund wird der americas cup auch in valencia abgehalten was die abstimmungsarbeit an der balance allerdings zu einer schwierigen angelegenheit macht das wochenende in valencia wird f r die ingenieure eine faszinierende herausforderung und wir alle freuen uns schon darauf
4457072 meine ersten gedanken sind das ist eine neue strecke auf der wir noch niemals zuvor gefahren sind und sie hat rundherum leitplanken ich denke die ganze formel 1 kann es kaum erwarten nach valencia zu fahren es ist eine sch ne stadt und es wird einfach herrlich werden in ihren stra en zu fahren
4457073 mit einem simulator kannst du nicht das feeling im auto reproduzieren
4457074 in unserer britischen basis haben wir einen simulator wie die meisten teams und haben damit viel zeit verbracht das ist essentiell wichtig wenn man die strecke kennenlernen will mit einem simulator kannst du nicht das feeling im auto reproduzieren aber du bekommst immerhin ein verst ndnis daf r wie die distanzen sind und wo sich die bremspunkte befinden das n tzt also durchaus etwas
4457075 wir haben mit monza spa francorchamps und silverstone einige schnelle kurse im rennkalender mit monaco und ungarn eher langsame unseren erwartungen nach wird valencia irgendwo in der mitte liegen es genie t auch die extraportion aufregung da es berall von leitplanken umz unt ist
4457076 das strengt den kopf gewaltig an und verlangt von dir auf jeder einzelnen runde volle konzentration
4457077 die herausforderung eine neue strecke kennen zu lernen ist immer eine aufregende sache besonders wenn es so ein ungew hnlicher ort ist wie der neue stra enkurs in valencia
4457078 abgesehen von unseren vorbereitungen um vorfeld des rennens werden das ablaufen der strecke mit den ingenieuren am donnerstag sowie die trainingssessions am freitag eine wahre schl sselrolle einnehmen um den kurs zu lernen und das gripniveau abzusch tzen
4457079 eine neue strecke ffnet das feld immer ein wenig und bietet dem fahrer die m glichkeit einen gr eren einfluss zu nehmen denn unser feedback wird sehr wichtig sein um das passende setup herauszufinden wir sind gut aufgestellt und ich freue mich schon auf dieses wochenende und die chance punkte zu machen
4457080 wir d rfen ein hei es rennwochenende erwarten was die physische herausforderung f r fahrer auto und team noch erh hen wird ich bin ein gro er fan der stadt valencia
4457081 es ist ein sch ner ort und hoffentlich wird das rennen der formel 1 eine menge neuer fans verschaffen

4457083 the theory is that damage to the nerve due to ear infections somehow alters the perception of food so that the person is more likely to enjoy high fat and sweet food and possibly drink more alcoholic beverages
4457084 all these foods are energy dense and increase the risk of becoming obese
4457085 this might be only one small piece of a larger puzzle
4457086 stress management doesnt have to be a whole lot of hocus pocus

4457093 when chelsea is interviewed its exhibit 154 she tells the police officers very simply that she was serving them 35 cent wings and 2 75 pints 2 75 pints and that the average bill was 30 simple math very basic simple math will tell you that if you had 20 wings at 7 00 if the bill was 25 that leaves 18 if the pints are 2 75 were talking about six pints
4457094 zazelenchuk also was critical of the drinking and driving attitudes held by winnipeg police officers he said two officers drinking with harvey zenk admitted to drinking four pitchers of beer during a two hour period and the evidence showed that on average all the officers at the lounge had an average of eight pitchers of beer in a two to three hour period
4457095 the average bill was 30 simple math very basic simple math will tell you that if you had 20 wings at 7 00 if the bill was 25 that leaves 18 if the pints are 2 75

4457097 the achievement gap is the greatest civil rights issue facing our country today
4457098 when you have a healthy middle class it really does change the dynamic of schools and housing
4457099 i recognize there is still a huge achievement gap but i dont want to lose the idea that our kids are gaining
4457100 some are gaining at a faster rate that is what is widening our gap
4457101 it gives me hope when we find out there are some places in spite of difficult situations that are doing well
4457102 all of this work is going to be around the achievement gap
4457103 they are focused like a laser beam on making sure all kids get a quality education all kids get what they need out of schools
4457104 were not going to wait for a state level mandate
4457105 parents and school administrators of english learners are impatient with this yearly lament over the persistent achievement gap and the failure to offer practical solutions to reverse the negative trend in the academic achievement of english learners
4457106 with this rate of progress it would take 55 years for all of our current english learners to become proficient
4457107 if you spend all your time teaching kids to take multiple choice tests you cant spend as much time teaching them to write a literary essay
4457108 our focus is on giving them the skills they need
4457109 at the beginning of the twentieth century a composer named luigi russolo authored a manifesto called the art of noises where he called for a new pallet of sounds for music that would reflect a more modern time the early 20th century way of pulling this off was to bring bells sirens and motorized gadgets on stage with an orchestra check out george antheils ballet mecanique while this served as the inspiration for a minor musical movement in the 1920s the whole idea soon faded away that is until samplers came along in the 1980s once the sample genie was let out of the bottle everyone from rappers to synth poppers made music out of any sound you could imagine so what makes this samsung commercial so compelling to me its really remarkable that an idea that was so radical in the last century can now be put front and center before a prime time mass market audience on mainstream tv the idea that you can grab just about any sound loop it and make music may be familiar to electronic musicians but putting in front of the summers biggest ad market is pretty darn cool

4457128 i know there are going to be those who are opposed to it
4457129 my thoughts are that when you have a possible situation where its a rider versus the concrete or asphalt i want the head protected
4457130 i also understand that the last thing some people want to do is wear a helmet
4457131 and i could also argue theyd probably say they arent going to do it anyway
4457132 it may be possible for each to think too much of his own potential glory hereafter it is hardly possible for him to think too often or too deeply about that of his neighbor
4457133 we took a very business like approach to the race
4457134 our start is typically fast but what we did really really well today was the middle 1000 metres we owned it
4457135 we probably relaxed just a bit more than we should have in the last 500 metres it would have been nice to finish first in the semi but were in the final and thats important
4457136 i was incredibly nervous the entire morning leading up to the competition and i didnt really know why
4457137 what happened today is good but im going to leave it behind me and know that saturday we all start at zero
4457138 a big high and then six outs away from even a higher high
4457139 of course i wanted to break the canadian record but to swim an olympic final and improve my ranking is something that i will cherish forever i always knew i had it in me to make an olympic final and today was the highlight of my career
4457140 to go in and be in the race with these girls and swim a lifetime best is just amazing

4457147 in short the merger has allowed frautschi and rowland to take far more for themselves than that to which they are legally or equitably entitled
4457148 the windfall that the defendants generated for themselves is no accident rather it is the result of a carefully planned and deftly engineered scheme
4457149 go into the hallways of our schools and we think its very ugly
4457150 i see it as inflammatory as using the n word which no one would do in a movie at that level

4457154 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4457155 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4457156 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors

4457163 this decision by the state of maryland to drop the charges shows that our side of the story was the true story
4457164 there were no traffic jams there were no people running in and out of traffic there was no refusal to disperse they plainly and simply violated our first amendment rights
4457165 we congratulate the courageous men and women with defend life on having their unjust charges dropped this is a tremendous victory for those arrested in maryland as well as for the innocent children for which we advocate
4457166 every now and then we see rogue police officers who think they can inflict their personal biases on the public without regard to the law this kind of injustice is a type of tyranny that cannot be allowed to stand

4457173 because addictions can manifest themselves differently in youth than in adults many young people can develop serious problems and yet do not receive the help they need
4457174 the signs are not picked up by those around them or their behaviour is dismissed as part of being young and growing up
4457175 selling came in and triggered a lot of stops below the market
4457176 once we broke the 800 mark it was a freefall from there
4457177 the schedule definitely was a lot tougher than i thought it was going to be doing it twice including the olympic trials in late june
4457178 im just proud of winning three medals would have hoped to do a little bit better but you cant really stick your nose up at three olympic medals
4457179 if im going to be in the sport for a while i want some fun
4457180 and this schedule you look at it and you dont go into it as excited as i feel i would have been if i was swimming two or three so i think i will evaluate and maybe focus in on three or four or two or three instead of five events

4457200 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4457201 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4457202 if i may be so bold there was another president

4457216 youve seen all the stuff in the papers and i havent got to say what the situation is
4457217 stephen warnock has come back and said he had no intention of putting a transfer request in
4457218 as for roque he has said he wants to stay it is silly because were preparing for a massive game against everton and some people seem to be creating so many issues at blackburn which arent there its not right and its not professional
4457219 the players that i want to keep are not leaving this club its as simple as that we have got two weeks to bring in two or three more players and once thats done we can crack on again

4457245 here is the difficulty for unless in disingenuousness or in thoughtlessness or in breathless haste to get the system finished we let this one thought slip away from us it is in all simplicity sufficient to decide that no existential system is possible and that no logical system may boast of an absolute beginning since such a beginning like pure being is a pure chimera
4457246 i think you can sometimes sense especially when he is interviewing alex salmond that he has a difficulty about scotland and scottish culture and it is possible that might be contributing to his views on burns
4457247 burns is a subtle and consummate poet and i dont think we need to worry about what jeremy paxman says about him
4457248 one of the fine things about burns is that he was not sentimental
4457249 of course he wrote a lot of trash but at his best he respected ordinary people and took their feelings seriously
4457250 divided between satire and sentimentality explosive vernacular and insipid english vigorous bawdry and pietistic moralising who was prevented from writing sustained poetry of the very highest sort
4457251 jeremy paxman should spend more time reading burns as burns wrote in to a louse o wad some powr the giftie gie us to see oursels as others see us in light of his daft comments about burns jeremy looks like a gowk

4457277 to set some context more than 2 000 women give birth at the infirmary annually there is no need for anyone who has not been contacted by us to take any action whatsoever

4457285 ive always been a fan of racing games and working on need for speed undercover was an amazing experience
4457286 i was so impressed by the scope and quality of the overall production that goes into a videogame these days it was like any other day on a hollywood set i felt right at home the black box team is doing tremendous work here and i cant wait to see the final game
4457287 the wizzard media player allows for unprecedented producer control and customization it incorporates all of the best features i have seen in other web video players and several that are innovative and unique
4457288 i expect a surge of content producers moving to this media player it has been my pleasure to work with wizzard in the development of a media player that exceeds my own lofty expectations it is exactly what i was looking for
4457289 the goal for wizzard is to bring the latest cutting edge video technologies to video producers and their audiences without sacrificing backward compatibility for legacy users
4457290 and in doing so we are simplifying the video producers workflow to one upload that enjoys all the benefits of total distribution
4457291 i am confident that bills strategic thinking global perspective international business experience and established track record of strong results will allow us to continue to build on the success of cigna international

4457297 hollywood is an integral part of californias culture and economy every industry and culture in the state has played a role in making hollywood what it is today

4457300 the addition of mr spencer broadens our board expertise as we venture ahead
4457301 working with accelerator to license our technology to this new venture is an exciting new area for nanogen
4457302 our mgb technology has been widely licensed for research and diagnostic applications extending its utility to therapeutics is in keeping with our mission to improve patient care and will provide the company with new opportunities for revenues from non competing markets
4457303 mirina is the ninth company in which we have invested at accelerator
4457304 and it is the first based upon spinning technology out of an established publicly traded biotechnology company we are very excited to be entering the interesting area of nucleic acid based therapeutics and believe that the nanogen mgb technology should confer a significant advantage and differentiation to this effort
4457305 we continue to be impressed by accelerators ability to identify evaluate and license novel and exciting proprietary technologies
4457306 the field of mirna holds great promise for treating a wide variety of diseases and we are hopeful that the proven mgb core technology will provide mirina with significant advantages in this highly competitive and potentially lucrative area of therapeutic product development
4457307 aside from the traditional billing obstacles faced by any medical practice our specialty faces constant regulatory change and oversight that has required us to now use a new kind of practice management service that we feel will enable us to better navigate what is an increasingly challenging reimbursement environment for anesthesiologists
4457308 we were impressed with not only athenahealths services but also with their people because they are a large factor in facilitating the life of each claim resulting in fewer rejections and ultimately getting us reimbursed more efficiently by adding a fully integrated service operation to their athenacollector practice management offering they have built real time intelligence into our billing system we just dont know of any other vendor with this capability
4457309 athenahealth has worked for over a year to bolster our service offering to the anesthesiologist group segment as this is an extremely difficult specialty to service for traditional software only practice management vendors
4457310 we see a growing market opportunity to service this specialty and we are extremely excited that a leading anesthesiologist group is now leveraging our abilities specifically around new government initiatives like the expanded 2008 physician quality reporting initiative pqri from the centers for medicare and medicaid services
4457311 the overarching benefit of on demand services delivered via a national network like athenahealths is our ability to research qualify and update the network daily with new rules and measures athenahealths virtual back office service enables providers to participate in performance reporting programs without the disruption of having to maintain and update their traditional software only solutions

4457332 i have had a meeting with trevor purt chief executive of the primary care trust asking him to look at working with transport bosses to provide a free service from our hospital to fairfield
4457333 the people in charge of making the decision to axe services claimed they wouldnt slash any services from rochdale until alternatives including transport infrastructure were in place this promise has not been kept that is why extending this scheme with the full backing of the pct is so important

4457390 kurang lebih setelah tujuh tahun setengah setelah peristiwa 11 september muncul pernyataan yang sangat populer kenapa mereka membenci kita maka yang terpenting adalah memperkenalkan as kepada mereka dan memperbaiki nama baiknya di luar negeri
4457391 di antara upaya yang bisa digunakan sekarang ini adalah memberikan julukan julukan untuk kaum muslimin guna menghadapi agama islam di dunia dan julukan yang paling tepat adalah menyebut mereka dengan radikal
4457392 kebijakan baru ini tidak akan lagi dijuluki dengan perang salib karena kebijakan baru ini menyerang pemikiran dengan hal ini kita akan bisa mereaslisasikan tujuan kita

4457402 we are pleased to have ralph roberts join our board of directors ralphs extensive professional and worldwide business experience are valuable attributes as we continue to execute our long term profitable growth strategy and leverage our global footprint
4457403 our strong performance and cash flow enable us to return value to shareholders through dividends this action is a part of the process we have undertaken to enhance shareholder value as we continue to explore other options that we believe will help align the market value of the companys common stock with cablevisions underlying operating performance

4457405 for people of color living in under served communities access to the arts goes beyond entertainment it is critically important that members of our community both adults and youth are motivated to value the arts as a tool of empowerment professionally and educationally
4457406 our business continued to gain traction during the quarter and we achieved several significant milestones
4457407 we continue to see solid demand for our service offerings in the market as our core client sets are seeking ways in which to reduce cost on their embedded networks because of the general tightening of credit within the market with respect to our network optimization solutions we are presently analyzing networks throughout 40 countries we see this trend expanding in the second half of the year
4457408 today 75 of our revenues are predictable therefore 25 of our revenues are non predictable over the next twelve months we expect to see our total predictable revenue stream grow to approximately 6 million per month and become 70 of our total revenues producing gross margins of more than 50
4457409 the energy and economic environment have heightened the awareness of our customers of the benefits of phev technology odyne through its partner dueco inc has begun to deliver plug in parallel hybrid systems to some of the largest utility companies in the u s
4457410 our key objective is to insure that in addition to delivering fuel efficiency and lessening the environmental impact of the utility fleet we are delivering on the reliability expectations of our customers
4457411 odyne intends to increase its commitment of human and financial resources to the testing and validation of its parallel kits but until such time as we have furthered this process odyne does not expect to meet the production targets set out at the beginning of the year
4457412 yet price has become an increasingly important consideration for customers in the current economic environment
4457413 as a result despite our incremental investment in testing amp validation of parallel systems we still expect a lower cost structure for the company going forward
4457414 we would like to thank our advisors halter financial group and wlt brothers capital inc for their assistance in this process we appreciate the confidence of our investors in our business with the newly raised capital we hope to take advantage of significant growth opportunity in our business sector by leveraging our know how and industry leading position with the ultimate goal of delivering value to our shareholders

4457429 sekiranya fathimah binti muhammad saw mencuri maka aku sendiri yang memotong tangannya
4457430 ini semua fitnah dan ingin membunuh karakter saya di publik
4457431 ini adalah sikap yang tidak dewasa dan menunjukkan hati kerdil yang tidak bisa menerima sebuah perbedaan pendapat seharusnya ust m tholib tidak perlu bicara demikian karena hal ini hanya akan membuat perpecahan pada umat
4457432 masak saya di bilang syiah dan ahmadiyah padahal saya sedang mati matian memerangi ahmadiyah bersama para aktifis islam lainnya di indonesia ini justeru ust m tholib lah yang tak pernah kedengaran ikut aktif dalam memerangi ahmadiyah
4457433 menuduh orang sebagai syiah memang paling enak karena ketika tidak terbukti maka si penuduh bisa dengan enteng mengatakan bahwa si tertuduh sedang ber taqiyah hingga tuduhan itu akan selalu tersemat pada orang tersebut walaupun tidak pernah bisa di buktikan
4457434 ini semua fitnah dan ingin membunuh karakter saya di publik
4457435 ini adalah sikap yang tidak dewasa dan menunjukkan hati kerdil yang tidak bisa menerima sebuah perbedaan pendapat
4457436 seharusnya ustadz m tholib tidak perlu bicara demikian karena hal ini hanya akan membuat perpecahan pada umat
4457437 masak saya di bilang syiah dan ahmadiyah padahal saya sedang mati matian memerangi ahmadiyah bersama para aktivis islam lainnya di indonesia ini justru ust m tholib lah yang tak pernah kedengaran ikut aktif dalam memerangi ahmadiyah
4457438 menuduh orang sebagai syiah memang paling enak karena ketika tidak terbukti maka si penuduh bisa dengan enteng mengatakan bahwa si tertuduh sedang ber taqiyah hingga tuduhan itu akan selalu tersemat pada orang tersebut walaupun tidak pernah bisa dibuktikan
4457439 i think sen gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that
4457440 all i can remember is going up i went up and i came down and i hit something very very hard
4457441 a soldier told me i hit the footpath but as far as i was concerned i thought i hit a telegraph pole cause all i could see was sparks and the smell of rubber
4457442 i looked down and i could see annes skirt and i thought oh poor annes been injured too
4457443 i thought wheres the rest of the girls and they werent i couldnt see anybody
4457444 i think the intelligence services have not fully cooperated with the investigation
4457445 my father said and i do believe his words theres a time for you to be born into this world and a time for you to be taken out of it
4457446 thats quite true cause its been proved cause all those people round me were all taken and i was saved but in saying that it was a hard fight a very hard fight
4457447 well respect the aspirations of the nepali people for peace
4457448 and well work for the preparation of a new constitution and for the forward looking transformation of the society
4457449 well try to bring other political parties on board as well
4457450 in my regular life i have a little brother who looks up to me so i just try to behave for him
4457451 the biggest thing ive learned is that everything that seemed so important when you were younger just goes out the window what other people think of you you just dont care anymore when you get a bit older you become more comfortable with yourself
4457452 we are gathering figures from various areas and it is close to 100 000 it may be more than that
4457453 this will create a big humanitarian problem we are going to appeal to civil society and international donor agencies for help
4457454 whatever is the courts judgment some of them would not be satisfied it is not far fetched that such dissatisfaction would further impinge on the fluid security situation in mindanao
4457455 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4457456 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4457457 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4457458 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4457459 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4457460 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4457461 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4457462 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4457463 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4457464 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4457465 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4457466 some sad incidents happened at a time when we had a boom in the tourism industry it is as if the sun had set at noon
4457467 my effort will be bring the leaders of the agitation to the table so that all the problems are resolved
4457468 hes the leading evangelical figure hes trying to craft a new direction a new image for evangelicals the fact that this is happening at saddleback not focus on the family makes it more neutral ground its an audience that both obama and mccain have a real shot at getting
4457469 take up the causes that are politically correct and dont want to take up issues that are controversial
4457470 we thank god for his emphasis but its interesting that the candidates are going to a voice that has been somewhat silent on the great foundational issues of abortion and marriage even though he would stand for those
4457471 we are in danger of losing this whole country to the secularism of europe
4457472 i dont see any conflict at all and if there was i wouldnt be a part of it
4457473 im focused on the same thing rick warren is focused on i think evangelicals must be talking about disease and poverty
4457474 i believe that pastor rick is going to ask a wide range of questions and i believe he will ask questions about issues of life efforts to redefine marriage the importance of family and other issues that are of concern to traditional evangelicals
4457475 i dont know how hard he will press its sort of a new role for him
4457476 no matter what you answer somebodys going to disagree with you
4457477 there are a lot of americans who feel disaffected by both the left and the right
4457478 using his influence to become the next jerry falwell or james dobson
4457479 if you dont just focus on those two issues if you say there are a variety of issues that ought to be of concern to evangelicals you can plausibly see evangelicals saying obama is better on the first three mccain is better on the last two
4457480 mccain and the republicans need to have evangelicals vote mostly on social issues
4457481 if they do that theyll vote mccain obama is a very strong candidate to appeal to moderate evangelicals he talks about his faith in a compelling way and appeals to them on poverty the environment and the desire for change
4457482 counter my convictions and the convictions of masses of believing americans
4457483 i think the church is in danger of a deception of being courted by senator obama
4457484 its not one of our key worries for the rating at this stage
4457485 we are more worried about the current account deficit rising external debt levels and inflation
4457486 but if you had escalation or even if a small clash simply prompted capital flight then that would have a negative effect conflict would certainly be negative but that is not something we see as very likely at this stage
4457487 if inflation stays at these levels in quite high double figures then that would add to risks to the macroeconomy and possibly prompt negative ratings action
4457488 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case
4457489 lots of people were saying they should not sponsor us if they are doing things like this
4457490 there is no bigger issue for most liverpool fans than hillsborough and the sun and sensitivity was called for
4457491 lost for words theres no way on gods earth ill ever buy that stuff again
4457492 disgusting lfc should sever all connections with carlsberg after this utter disrespect for the 96 and the loyal fans who actively campaign against that rag mag
4457493 we are quite aware there has been mistake and we are very sorry about this we are doing all we can to repair the damage
4457494 xbox 360 has been an important partner in our efforts to offer consumers more ways to experience our artists music and this is especially true among gamers who are some of the most passionate music fans with this agreement we can take advantage of microsofts music platform and provide gamers what they want music videos from their favorite artists that can be downloaded quickly and easily

4457498 if you read a mainstream media news report about file sharing or talk to a reporter about illicit filesharing you would think that the only case involving the riaa was capitol v thomas a case that made news nationwide for the size of the fines however there are a number of cases going on around the country cases where the riaa did not win atlantic v anderson which has taken over 3 years from start to finish the riaa eventually dropped it with prejudice meaning they accept the fault was theirs in this case a similar thing happened in the case against another alleged filesharer foster but both cases were relatively under reported in mainstream media copyright law like most other aspects of civil law allows for the prevailing party to recoup legal fees and costs incurred in the case this is exactly what foster and anderson did with success the foster case was awarded over 68 000 in attorney fees and costs likewise the anderson case was awarded fees and costs but of a substantially greater amount 107 834 to be precise in an order dated july 28th 2008 it is encouraging to finally hear that last night the riaa and the member companies that were involved in the case finally paid the fees they refused first putting an end to this protracted legal wrangling the amount paid was not however 107 834 but a figure of 107 951 a figure which takes into account interest accrued due to delay it should be noted that while this is the end of atlantic v anderson it is not the end of anderson v atlantic the case where ms anderson is taking her former accusers to task over their practices in this field it is a heartening victory and one that is spurring the tide mistrial making the 222 000 judgment null and void the two largest decisions in the riaas war on downloading have been against them in both cases the riaa admitted it was wrong and ordered to pay the fees

4457537 i have to say sorry to dpp members and supporters with a heavy heart i let everybody down and caused irreparable damage to the party this was not my intention but i made mistakes
4457538 to show my deepest remorse my wife wu shu chen and i leave the dpp from now
4457539 have requested assistance in their investigation and we have immediately started our own probe
4457540 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
4457541 in many cases all candidates have three as and increasingly four as
4457542 some talented pupils do more than three a levels because they enjoy the work and the challenge
4457543 in fact they might be disadvantaging themselves by taking the edge off their overall performance by doing so much
4457544 but im sure there are those who think that offering something extra will give them extra credit with universities it wont
4457545 increasingly pupils have opted for four or five as a way of distinguishing themselves from other candidates
4457546 my own feeling is that pupils should not be encouraged to do too many a levels because it eats into time that should be devoted to all those other important aspects of an education such as sport public speaking and the performing arts
4457547 it would have been more than 30 000 for the academic year and that doesnt count summer right
4457548 but theres a big caveat here and thats that weve never experienced the perfect storm before rising tuitions well beyond inflation in a recessionary climate with a shrinking school age population
4457549 who knows if it will ever be this low again
4457550 but this is not just about money its the countrys reputation for quality lack of corruption and huge range of choice that attracts students
4457551 the number is 4 000 the number of accredited colleges and universities in the u s about a third of the higher education capacity in the whole world
4457552 our students did a research project last spring about students experiences acquiring visas and entering the country and there was no shortage of unpleasant experiences shared

4457581 sekiranya dia benar dia akan selamat tetapi jika dia berbohong lambat laun kelaknatan allah akan turun kepadanya dalam berbagai perkara yang tidak tergambar oleh dirinya sendiri
4457582 keberanian saiful melafazkan lafaz yang seperti itu menunjukkan samada dia meyakini apa yang dia dakwa ataupun dia tidak faham akan kesan terhadap lafaz berkenaan pada masa hadapan
4457583 bukan mudah seseorang melafazkan sumpah mubahalah itu melainkan dia dalam keadaan tidak siuman ataupun dia sedar apa yang diyakini itu benar
4457584 oleh kerana akan timbul kesangsian pihak yang di cabar dan untuk menghilangkan keraguan masyarakat maka pihak yang didakwa iaitu datuk seri anwar ibrahim hendaklah melafazkan sumpah bermubahalah dengan bentuk yang sama maka jadilah mubahalah yang mana kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti

4457590 in a nation in which 66 of the voting age population is overweight and 32 is obese could sen obamas skinniness be a liability despite his visits to waffle houses ice cream parlors and greasy spoon diners around the country his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
4457591 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones
4457592 the pew forum on religion and public life found that while a majority of young white evangelicals describe themselves as conservative on social issues slightly more identified this year as either independents or democrats than as republicans in 2001 about the time that merritt was working as precinct captain for the republican party an overwhelming majority of young evangelicals identified with the gop
4457593 although polling suggests voters view faith as an essential ingredient in a president mccain has never been a candidate to invoke god or dwell on religion
4457594 in vietnam mccains fellow prisoners say their faith was a matter of life and death we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves said orson swindle a marine captain who spent six years in captivity the prisoners had developed a tap code system for communicating through the walls through that tapping we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week swindle said

4457597 youre talking about a couple of points but this is very very close potentially thats the election
4457598 only once at the beginning of the week did mr
4457599 standing behind a lectern in michigan this week with two trusted senators ready to do his bidding john mccain seemed to forget for a moment that he was only running for president
4457600 asked about his tough rhetoric on the ongoing conflict in georgia mccain began if i may be so bold there was another president he caught himself and started again at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4457601 with his democratic opponent on vacation in hawaii the senator from arizona has been doing all he can in recent days to look like president mccain particularly when it comes to the ongoing international crisis in georgia we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable said lawrence korb a reagan defense department official who now acts as an informal adviser to the obama campaign its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4457602 andrew k mccain 46 was on the board of silver state bancorp for five months before he resigned on july 25 for unspecified personal reasons according to a news release issued by the bank at the time a week after mr mccains departure the henderson nev company reported a loss of 62 7 million in the second quarter and said its capital the banks cushion to absorb losses had eroded significantly at the same time silver state announced the resignations of its chief executive and chairman

4457618 sen obama outlined a plan thursday to raise tax rates on capital gains and dividend income from 15 to 20 for individuals and families making more than 200 000 and 250 000 respectively he also detailed a plan to levy payroll taxes on earnings above 250 000 at a rate between 2 and 4 though that increase wouldnt occur for at least a decade right now payroll taxes used to fund retirement benefits are levied on income up to 102 000
4457619 jason furman sen obamas economic policy director said the plan would cut taxes to less than 18 2 of gross domestic product thats lower than the level of taxes when ronald reagan was president he said the proposed rates are below the levels many had expected given sen obamas campaign rhetoric nonetheless critics said the plan would exacerbate an economic downturn and harm workers
4457620 obama blinked and stands guilty of appeasing clinton by agreeing to a roll call vote for her nomination that he might not have had much choice if he wanted peace only proves the point that hes playing defense at his own convention what does he get out of it not much and not for long
4457621 the fleeting sense that he is a magnanimous nominee wont get him a single vote he wouldnt get anyway ditto for the idea that hes going the extra mile to unify the party those who refuse to accept him as the legitimate winner arent likely to do so just because he caves into her demands
4457622 we find that proper tire inflation could save more than a billion gallons of fuel per year and do it several years sooner than expanded drilling could produce a single drop mccain has exaggerated by representing obamas suggestion as a silly notion or implying that it constitutes his entire energy policy but we also figure that expanded offshore drilling is projected to produce far more oil eventually than can be saved by proper tire inflation nearly three times as much even by the conservative estimate of government experts and more than 10 times as much if an industry endorsed estimate is correct
4457623 it absolutely floored me said phil burress head of the ohio based citizens for community values it would doom him in ohio burress emailed about a dozen pro family leaders he knows outside ohio and forwarded it to three mccain aides tasked with christian conservative outreach that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates burress wrote in the message
4457624 he and other ohio conservatives met privately with mccain in june and while the nominee didnt promise them an anti abortion rights running mate his staff said they could almost guarantee that would be the case burress recalled
4457625 some analysts dismissed that explanation saying the mccain organization has several experienced operatives who are themselves evangelicals or catholics and strongly pro life and so it already knew what the reaction would be
4457626 if tom ridge is on the ticket i will not be voting republican home school legal defense association president mike farris said told the washington times
4457627 there is nothing under delaware law that would prevent biden from running for both vice president and the senate this year
4457628 obama has also shown he is willing to hold the liberal blogosphere at arms length most recently by ignoring internet entreaties to abandon support for a compromise bill on warrantless wiretapping
4457629 the main thing is im trying to help sen mccain but to the extent i can bring some minnesota ideas or minnesota perspective to the table hopefully thats good for minnesota and good for the country
4457630 ive not been told anything in that regard and i just dont get into it ive just stopped talking about it
4457631 after initially saying that he did not know how the lawyers were chosen to represent ms hunter and mr young mr baron acknowledged that he might have played a role
4457632 the revelations of ties among the lawyers emerged through public records and interviews with people close to mr edwards and ms hunter which suggested that their affair went on longer than mr edwards admitted and that the effort to conceal it by mr edwardss inner circle was much more extensive than has been reported the review found that mr edwardss political action committee went to unusual lengths to make a final 14 000 payment to ms hunters film company months after its contract with the committee had ended the payment was issued while the committee was short on cash and could pay its bills only after receiving thousands of dollars from mr edwardss presidential campaign and donations from four people including mr barons wife
4457633 now i know youre probably asking yourself how much of this is true well fuck you whats important is i saved that girl

4457641 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4457642 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4457643 im concerned with the way the attorney general frames the problem
4457644 he talks about arbitrary or irrelevant differences between criminal and national security investigations but these were corrections originally designed to prevent the type of overreach the fbi engaged in for years
4457645 nobodys complaining about the fbi collecting domestic intelligence when its appropriate and authorized under the law
4457646 what the attorney general is doing is expanding the bureaus intelligence collection without addressing the mismanagement within the fbi if you have an agency collecting more with less oversight its only going to get worse
4457647 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4457648 but i feel like this journey has been so long

4457675 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
4457676 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result
4457677 when the player has similar downsides it means we can make a lot more interesting monsters we dont have to kill you to challenge you we can make a monster that affects your mobility we can make a monster that has different kinds of attacks that are dangerous to you and that you actually have to avoid and so it makes the combat a lot more interesting
4457678 a lot of the choices we make are styled towards knowing the long term
4457679 i think that hardcore players long term will find a game that has lot more depth for them but we distinctly made the choice that in the first stage of difficulty the games really easy so its easy to get through its fun to play and you can kind of spam with one skill but as you get further and further into the game you start having to go okay now ive really got to use this ground stomp thing to stun some monsters and get some distance from them to recover thats something that we focus on more later in the game
4457680 before i came here this morning i passed by the grave of those that were killed during the rice riot and told them that i am going to tell your story
4457681 my father was killed by the tolbert government because he was the father of d karn carlor
4457682 we were beaten and tortured in prison because we had a concern that was in the interest of every liberian
4457683 villages were burnt in the south eastern region of this country my grandfather and others died thousands of parents were killed and nobody talked about them because they were nobody to dare confront the so called americo liberians people were killed because they were pal members people said we were reckless but we were not reckless because we followed the law on the books if somebody says pal people committed a crime because we follow the law then i submit but then i will again say we did not because we followed the constitution
4457684 any way as long as monrovia was where they resided liberia was nice
4457685 oliver bright the justice minister during the rice riot refused to grant us permit to carry out our demonstration rather he ordered the army and the police to shoot and kill any child that was found in the street on april 14 1980
4457686 people thought we had no right to be heard and had no part to play because the government wanted to increase the price of rice and we questioned it so we had committed a crime
4457687 the luxury you have today was not there during our time because they were all managed by the true whig party twp we were beaten tortured and killed for you to have the luxury you have today therefore if anybody is taken to task because of the work of the trc pal will go to court because we have legitimate claims
4457688 we wanted to teach them a lesson very badly and to rub their nose in the sand
4457689 do you understand that the people producing and importing this rice need to make profit
4457690 yes indeed its true that he went there but to stop a coup

4457695 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
4457696 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
4457697 one thing wed like to do next is to treat an animal model which already has considerable quantities of alpha synuclein aggregates to see if hsp104 can actually reverse the process in the rat brain
4457698 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4457709 gangs in palestine serious incidents spread alarm throughout the country
4457710 several armed gunmen formed a barricade on the highway between nablus tulkaram and jaffa they stopped every car that passed and asked the passengers if there were jews or british soldiers among them if there were none they asked the arab passengers with the utmost courtesy to hand over the money they had on them saying it was for the national cause within three quarters of an hour they had succeeded in collecting between 300 and 400 pounds however they did assault three jews swearing revenge for al qassam
4457711 for obstructing commerce and traffic by throwing large quantities of nails onto the street
4457712 the rebels are holed up in the mountains and airplanes are flying overhead in order to locate their positions while soldiers swarm the cities in pursuit of others

4457719 katrina has influenced my artwork exponentially its basically my jumping off point
4457720 it is something i knew id have to deal with in rebuilding my life
4457721 he told me if i could put anything together theyd look at it
4457722 it was great to be making art again but i didnt know where i wanted to go with it i wanted to do something pertaining to katrina but i was so angry
4457723 when i came to iowa state i wanted to make work that would help me cope with the aftermath of hurricane katrina i was looking for closure from what i had just been through the emotional and psychological toll that my mind and body endured after katrina left me questioning everything i had ever learned the world seemed to be flipped on its axis and i felt as though i was free falling out of control the ease at which everything i owned was destroyed left me sick to my stomach at times the total lack of respect for human life at the hands of the united states government during hurricane katrina is something i will never forget
4457724 it has the appearance of function but it doesnt actually work thats my critique of the government after katrina
4457725 the dome represents the superdome and its legs are modeled after crawfish the factory denotes new orleans shipping yard the back hoe is the destruction and recovery of the city and the water tower sits on an oil rig structure representing the special interests
4457726 it takes four people to operate the real point is to get people to work together towards a common goal to encourage community
4457727 three of the four stations are dependent upon each other to work properly
4457728 katrina was a life changing experience and i plan on drawing inspiration from it probably for the rest of my life
4457729 but the theme wont be katrina my artwork will be geared toward community getting people involved actively participating i want to stay on the theme of multiple people activating one sculpture
4457730 disparities in screening between racial and ethnic groups even in a homogeneous state such as nebraska are a problem and by digging into some of the differences we were able to have an impact on breast and cervical cancer screening
4457731 a snapshot of the women served through the program and the services they received
4457732 we have used the data to direct program resources and manpower
4457733 programs such as ewm together with other outreach efforts in the state might have helped to improve or increase preventive services such as screening for breast and cervical cancer to the point where nebraska ranked 26th in screening for these conditions in 1990 and now ranks 16th nationwide
4457734 we look for eligible populations then see who is not being screened and target them
4457735 i think this is really about tapping into both online and offline
4457736 i think thats also a big part of what marketers want to do

4457827 i came to the conclusion that god probably has better things to do than worry about or interfere with every little thing that is important to me i figure creation is basically rolling along and me and you roll with it some things are in our control and we do what we can with those like wearing a seatbelt or getting a decent education and so on

4457849 the foreign minister of russia said thursday that georgia could forget about getting back its two breakaway provinces and the former soviet republic remained on edge as russia sent tank columns to search out and destroy georgian military equipment uncertainty about russias intentions and back and forth charges clouded the conflict two days after russia and georgia signaled acceptance of a french brokered cease fire and a week after georgias crackdown on the two provinces drew a russian military response

4457852 the new international tax rankings are out for 2008 and congratulations to washington d c are again in order our political class has managed to maintain americas rank with the second highest corporate tax rate in the world at 39 3 average combined federal and state only japan is slightly higher overall though if you are silly enough to base a corporation in california iowa new jersey pennsylvania or other states with high corporate levies your tax rate on business income is even higher than in tokyo for the first time the u s statutory rate is now 50 higher than the average of our international competitors
4457853 why are optimists about the state of the world disproportionately represented by classical liberals libertarians and free market conservatives while pessimists about the state of the world are disproportionately represented by statists this pattern is so familiar that it eludes our attention and yet reflection on it is fascinating theres no obvious reason why persons on the left should be biased into perceiving the state of the current world to be especially dire and no obvious reason why market friendly people should be biased into perceiving roses where there is really only rot
4457854 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

4457869 albertas beef producers raise world class beef and are stewards of the land livestock and the industry and we feel that the raised right campaign truly celebrates their commitment and work ethic
4457870 the raised right campaign is a reflection of the heritage and values that producers across the province stand for and for the world renowned beef that they deliver
4457871 we couldnt think of a better place to kick off the campaign the bar u ranch commemorates the history and importance of ranching in alberta and the murals are a tribute to the people who make the industry what it is today
4457872 we are excited to launch the raised right campaign and we hope everyone will enjoy it and share in our pride for the people who continue to build the industry and ensure its future
4457873 help avoid misuse of the esa to regulate climate change
4457874 esa consultations in the 21st century address increasingly complex issues we need a regulatory framework to guide those consultations that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as climate change
4457875 the esa was not the right tool to set u s climate policy or regulate green house gas emissions
4457876 we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat

4457880 although lingayats in past centuries were noted for their religious poetry and philosophical writings today the chief arts are the singing and playing of hymns there is no marked ability shown in the visual arts
4457881 lingayat priests called ayya or swami are also astrologers and medicine men often dispensing herbal remedies to sick villagers this is a useful craft for them to possess rather than a learned profession
4457882 diabetes is unique in that it requires significant commitment and adherence by the patient to keep it in control if patients are not comfortable communicating issues related to their quality of life over time they may adhere less and less to their regimen putting them increasingly at risk for complications
4457883 as this survey shows a percentage of individuals living with diabetes and taking insulin are altering what they eat during the day to avoid injections or even skipping the injection entirely even if that only happens rarely omission of insulin depending on the circumstance may have an impact on a patients overall health and potentially leave them at risk for serious diabetes related complications
4457884 i am not surprised that many people with diabetes are not talking with the doctors or diabetes educators about their injections
4457885 for years i skipped meals or injections to avoid the hassle and discomfort of taking them but when it came to talking with my doctor about it i did not speak up as much as i could have when i did finally talk to my diabetes educator about my injections i learned there were other less painful ways to manage my diabetes effectively i am so happy i finally said something

4457900 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4457901 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4457902 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4457903 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4457904 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4457905 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4457906 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4457907 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4457908 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4457927 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4457928 we agreed with french president sarkozys main principles for resolving the conflict these principles must be accepted by the georgian side
4457929 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4457930 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4457931 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4457932 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4457933 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4457934 to begin to repair its relations with the united states and europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbours
4457935 the surprise was not so much that the next move in rates is likely to be down that has been our forecast for some time but that the central bank seems happy to nurture this expectation

4457941 we took up station guarding the opposed landing on the abkhaz shore when all of a sudden four high speed targets were detected we sent out an iff signal and the targets didnt react receiving a command from the flagship we got into formation and right at that moment the unidentified targets opened fire on the ship formation and flagship the cruiser was damaged and a small fire broke out aboard then fearing for seaworthiness the flagship withdrew from the firing area

4458017 quando iniziai a lavorare allufficio non avevo unidea precisa ero contrario al consumo ma con lapertura mentale per trovare la migliore soluzione per risolvere il problema non ero certamente favorevole alla decriminalizzazione ma presto mi resi conto che le leggi erano inutili e senza alcun impatto sulla diffusione o il prezzo delle droghe

4458031 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4458032 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4458033 we agreed with french president sarkozys main principles for resolving the conflict these principles must be accepted by the georgian side
4458034 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4458035 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4458036 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4458037 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4458038 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4458039 to begin to repair its relations with the united states and europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbours

4458048 el gobierno tiene la responsabilidad de defender el inter s general sobre los particulares esto pasa con la venta de alcohol en las estaciones de servicio hay muchos de los que venden alcohol que se quejan porque no tomamos medidas y se quejan porque tomamos estas medidas o se quejan por los accidentes de tr nsito que hay
4458049 en nuestro sistema jur dico existe normativa de diferentes jerarqu as que se han ocupado en forma fragmentaria del tema y dando soluciones parcializadas resultando absolutamente insuficientes para abordar la problem tica del consumo abusivo de alcohol
4458050 el considerable aumento del consumo de alcohol por menores que se viene produciendo en uruguay en los ltimos a os es especialmente preocupante
4458051 entre los agentes que explican este aumento exponencial del consumo de alcohol se encuentra el rol que cumplen los mensajes que llegan permanentemente a los j venes a trav s de los medios de comunicaci n y como se relacionan con sus comportamientos
4458052 j venes y adultos son persuadidos y seducidos hacia el consumo de alcohol en campa as intensas que recurren a todo el potencial comunicacional que no cuenta con el principio de responsabilidad social
4458053 genera honda preocupaci n el consecuente esfuerzo de la industria publicitaria en asociar el consumo de al cohol al concepto de bebida necesaria para las personas en su desarrollo social
4458054 se proh be cualquier forma de publicidad de bebidas alcoh licas que contenga o presente a menores de edad o personas que por sus caracter sticas fison micas lo parezcan o a personas de notoriedad p blica entre los menores de 18 a os

4458065 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
4458066 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
4458067 one thing wed like to do next is to treat an animal model which already has considerable quantities of alpha synuclein aggregates to see if hsp104 can actually reverse the process in the rat brain
4458068 disparities in screening between racial and ethnic groups even in a homogeneous state such as nebraska are a problem and by digging into some of the differences we were able to have an impact on breast and cervical cancer screening
4458069 a snapshot of the women served through the program and the services they received
4458070 we have used the data to direct program resources and manpower
4458071 programs such as ewm together with other outreach efforts in the state might have helped to improve or increase preventive services such as screening for breast and cervical cancer to the point where nebraska ranked 26th in screening for these conditions in 1990 and now ranks 16th nationwide
4458072 we look for eligible populations then see who is not being screened and target them

4458101 we take the information received in our surveys as well as data from economic sources roll all of that up and get the aggregate average from those numbers
4458102 this was all direct spending which in turn resulted in indirect money being contributed to the local economy in the form of wages and taxes from tourism related employees
4458103 visitors and tourists spent 14 043 223 in direct expenditures in 2007 which resulted in 351 952 in indirect spending a year ago
4458104 our study gives us a relevant perspective of local residents versus travelers in jefferson county
4458105 tourism is actually not a large part of the economy in jefferson county in spite of the significant increase in tourism dollars last year only one in every 15 jobs are directly related to the tourism industry in the county

4458187 you would expect six or seven tests this is a feature of increased awareness in the sports population the figures are encouraging rather than showing anything else
4458188 i dont think officials should enter into speculation like that and unfairly question the achievements of athletes in beijing

4458192 one of the most common places for people to sue because they will generally win are nations that are or have formerly been part of the british commonwealth where there is no first amendment and the law looks more toward protecting the reputation of people than protecting the free speech of speakers

4458200 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4458201 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4458202 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory

4458205 repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4458206 i spent the last week in colombia with edgar ramirez talking pablo and he has every intention of portraying escobar
4458207 down turned lips become rounded and lifted giving the entire face a younger appearance
4458208 slide the shield along the outside of teeth all the way back into mouth while pushing in the front so half moon flaps rest behind front teeth study this drawing which shows how the device would look if you could see inside your mouth
4458209 theres never been a study thats shown that flexing the muscles does anything
4458210 the idea for some of these flexing devices is that by flexing the muscle it becomes stronger and hopefully doesnt droop as much
4458211 but the problem with a drooping muscle is not that its weak its that its lax scientifically as a physician and one whos taken many gross anatomy courses it makes absolutely no scientific sense to me at all that these claims are true
4458212 after one laser treatment i get so many compliments on my beautiful radiant skin
4458213 your skins outer layers make or break your glow factor if yours are dry they wont allow light in
4458214 chronic stress can produce hormones that damage the skin robbing it of many of the nutrients it needs to look healthy and dullness can be the result
4458215 before the peels i relied on thick concealers to hide my marks but now i dont even use foundation
4458216 my skin flaked for a few days but about one week later the peeling stopped my marks were gone after the second treatment
4458217 if you lighten four or five of your darkest spots you can look 10 years younger
4458218 because it doesnt distinguish between your normal tone and a splotch it will leave skin with bleached areas if used across your face
4458219 my lines have practically vanished and my skin looks smoother the cost of my treatments was worth it
4458220 i loved that i could go right back to work
4458221 theyre not going to erase deep wrinkles but they can make shallow lines look better after three months
4458222 they could have leveraged their current strength to create opportunities for consumers to use video online but it makes it makes sense monetarily for nbc to focus on their main revenue source and large global brands

4458225 photoaging which is the damage to skin caused by sunlight accounts for approximately 80 percent of wrinkles
4458226 thats why monks who live their lives in dark monasteries have skin like a teenager when theyre 80
4458227 a topical product with the right ingredients can make a significant difference in the early stages of aging
4458228 the skin around the eyes is the thinnest on the body
4458229 there isnt as much collagen and elastin there to begin with which means once you start acquiring some sun damage its one of the first areas on the face to wrinkle
4458230 the better antioxidants can also make skin less sensitive to the sun
4458231 they cause inflammation around the sinuses and dilated blood vessels under the eyes
4458232 directly beneath the surface of the thin undereye skin youve got a multitude of tiny veins stacked on top of one another in crisscrossing directions its this confluence of color right beneath the skin that can give it the darkish hue
4458233 the reason you see lines here early on is because the skin is exposed and its a delicate area
4458234 even if you diligently apply sunscreen to your face it often gets rubbed off right near the mouth when you use a napkin or lick your lips
4458235 by regularly getting rid of the dead skin here you reduce the appearance of lines
4458236 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4458237 sailing is a very happy sport its not like running
4458238 sailors like to have their cake and eat it too i helped them clean up their diets and lower body fat
4458239 the right foods can make the difference between medalists and hopefuls the last thing you want is to be upchucking or cramping out on the water

4458270 although indians may sell goods to other indians free of sales taxes most indian sales are to non indians tribes argue that treaties dating to the 19 th century allow them to avoid state government sales taxes but state officials going back to the 1980s have argued sales to non indians are taxable and the money should be collected

4458284 hes very even keel very cerebral he plays and lives at the same level even when he gets hit hard or throws an interception he bounces right back hes just not a guy that gets intimidated
4458285 he doesnt have to do everything hes got a lot of people on that team that can do great things andrews role is to make good decisions and manage the offense well thats his forte hes good at making good decisions under pressure
4458286 i remember in high school he went four for five in a baseball game

4458377 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4458416 i am getting a puppy this weekend and i have read your my smart puppy book and watched the video but i am not clear on how to teach the no command please help
4458417 i know youre very excited but im have class now
4458418 i am very excited i have been up against aris in the past and i have come to understand that this is a very good team with excellent organization on all levels that it has amazing fans that passionately support the team and it is definitely going to be an amazing stop n my career now that i am going to be an aris member i feel wonderful about the fans the team and everything in general
4458419 to start of the presence of andrea mazzon means a lot to me i had him as coach last year on fortitudo bologna and i enjoy playing for him the other reason that greatly influenced my decision was the goal to once again send the team off to euroleague i had the same goal last season while playing for fortitudo i would like to help aris go out to euroleague that was also the main discussion i had with the coach when we spoke on the phone once he became the coach we spoke and he told me that he would like to help the team in going off to euroleague and he would be very happy if i could contribute to that effort it was easy for me to come to aris since i have cooperated with him in the past and i really like the way he works he is a very good coach and a very good person this is the best combination for me since he gets respect from those around him and he knows how to make a player better my family was also excited about my coming to aris since i have a young daughter and i want to live in a city that she would like i have heard from nikos zisis when we were playing for benetton treviso that thessaloniki is very nice and after all of this i really want to come
4458420 whenever you play for a team like aris who has achieved many great things in the past then it is logical for you to wish for the same things in the future we have a difficult year ahead of us but we have the same aspirations as all the other teams that wish to go higher we will be especially competitive both in the greek championship and the eurocup we will set high goals and we will work hard at achieving them
4458421 the first thing they should expect from me is that i always give it my 100 both in defense and offense even if i am on the bench i will find ways to make myself useful to the team i also have many leadership characteristics and i know how to play european basketball and what i need to do to be successful what i expect is to help aris and become a piece of the puzzle that will help the team be successful next season
4458422 unfortunately last season i had some injuries that did not allow me to play as i know and can play i had one injury that left me out of game time for some time and when i returned bad luck once again hit me that is all part of the past and now i am fine i worked hard through out the whole summer so that i can keep my body in shape and i am anxious to come back to europe so that i can compete on the same level as before
4458423 i remember that game very well but honestly before the game i had no idea i would have such a performance to be exact i saw that game just as i did any other game in the competition that is how i look at every game that night everything i tried had worked sometimes i go back in time and think of all the good moments but i would rather look ahead at what the future holds what i would like is to have many more nights like that but this time with aris and also to be productive for my team
4458424 concerning myself on an individual level i am not concerned with becoming mvp what i am concerned with is winning games if you are focused on this then success will come on an individual and team level like i said before i want aris to win
4458425 what i clearly remember is the atmosphere in the stadium and the dedication and passion of the teams fans with regards to the teams playing abilities aris is a very powerful competitor that plays a highly intelligent game this type of playing is one i can admire and relate to in short the committed fans the passion for the game and the teams intelligent playing style are the elements that stood out the most every time i played against them
4458426 definitely i always wanted to be part of a historic team i am aware that the fans of aris expect many victories this season and i hope that we can meet their expectations i find that it is very important that your fans expect the best from the team which they support in regards to aris specifically we have a great many new players and we will need some time in order to get used to one another this means that the public will have to be a little bit patient however if you have a good coach skilled players and committed fans everything will fall into place and i am confident that at with some time will be the team that can achieve many great things in the greek championship the greek cup and the eurocup

4458460 this transaction has far reaching economic and transportation benefits to the chicago region the midwest and the nation as well as for cn and its customers
4458461 this transaction enjoys significant support from a broad array of shippers and the range of other parties who have a stake in making sure that the serious rail congestion issues plaguing chicago are being addressed by sound transportation initiatives such as the acquisition by cn of the ej amp e
4458462 at the same time we are well aware of the concerns raised by communities along the ej amp e line about the environmental impacts of increased train traffic we are asking the stb to set a schedule providing for a decision on the merits which if favorable to cn would allow us to close on this transaction before the end of this year but would not cause any adverse environmental impacts before the board completes its environmental review and develops a full record on which to base the environmental mitigation that it may impose on the transaction
4458463 cn is prepared to take the positive step of closing this transaction before year end in a way that provides the stb with additional time to complete its environmental review by early 2009
4458464 we are hopeful that the final eis will conform to the view that this transaction is clearly beneficial to the environment of the broader chicago region and that the legitimate impacts on affected communities are not novel and can all be reasonably mitigated in accordance with sound stb precedents and the long established public policy framework governing railroad transactions throughout the united states
4458465 the chief concerns raised by opponents of this transaction are the impacts of train traffic that will be diverted from cn lines in chicago onto the ej amp e
4458466 our proposal would ensure that the stb has sufficient time to review those matters fully before it authorizes any diversion of traffic
4458467 we have consistently stated that we understand and are willing to address the concerns of communities that will experience train traffic increases as a result of this transaction

4458717 la liga deportiva de quito de ecuador venci este jueves de local por 4 2 al bol var de la paz de bolivia en el estadio casa blanca ubicado en la capital este partido correspondi a la primera fecha de la copa sudamericana
4458718 pese a dominar la segunda etapa liga no liquid el cotejo y a un minuto de finalizar el juego la desconcentraci n de su defensa permiti el descuento del equipo boliviano que lo mantiene con la esperanza para el partido de vuelta
4458719 el campe n de am rica comenz con fuerza su segundo reto internacional del a o bajo la batuta del volante argentino dami n manso liga de quito gole al bol var de la paz en su debut en la copa sudamericana

4458723 why should a servicer take a haircut or have a cram down for any borrower that truly has the ability to pay
4458724 just about anything that is on a local multiple listing service will be on realtor com
4458725 a consumer has to go to multiple sites to figure out the whole landscape
4458726 agents list about 77 to 78 percent of the homes on the market so there is another 22 to 23 percent of homes that 10 to 15 years ago people wouldnt be able to find
4458727 using sites that are not agent related is really critical
4458728 rather than actually pulling the information from a particular source you want that information pushed to you

4458733 young people now just dont know what it can do

4458735 we had to work that much harder to get development going

4458741 sometimes people listen to the news and hear that prices are falling nationally and they think that utah has dropped as far as some of the other states have
4458742 the problem is that over the past 10 years home prices have gone up at least twice as fast as incomes
4458743 a lot of the raises people have gotten in the past 10 years have been eaten up by huge increases in the cost of health insurance
4458744 if youre a renter trying to buy your first home its getting more and more difficult to buy anything unless you have a very high income
4458745 how much they are willing to negotiate depends on what kind of equity is left in the home

4458759 like millions of filipinos we want to watch the reunion concert but when we look for ways to get the tickets we are redirected to marlboro ph this is clearly tantamount to advertising
4458760 philip morris sought to gloss over any likely illegality which may arise from its sponsorship of the event by calling the reunion a promotional event not open to the general public but restricted to trade partners and adult smokers who have to obtain an invitation by registering in marlboros website
4458761 its leaders and other moros frequently stated that unless the us government became involved and used its influence to persuade the grp to implement a fair settlement the talks would not succeed

4458934 although google havent informed me exactly which post on this blog caused the activation of their hate crimes division the strength of feeling in the comments section here leads me to believe it was this one

4458944 why are we sometimes met with silence when we pray
4458945 if i regard wickedness in my heart the lord will not hear
4458946 behold the lords hand is not so short that it cannot save nor is his ear so dull that it cannot hear but your iniquities sins have made a separation between you and your god and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear
4458947 clearly god maintains the right to withhold answers to our prayers
4458948 so when you spread out your hands in prayer i will hide my eyes from you yes even though you multiply prayers i will not listen your hands are covered with blood
4458949 the bible singles out a particular sin that impedes our prayer life
4458950 therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you leave your offering there before the altar and go first be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your offering
4458951 you husbands in the same way live with your wives in an understanding way and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life so that your prayers will not be hindered
4458952 and forgive our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors
4458953 for if you forgive people their wrongdoing your heavenly father will forgive you as well but if you dont forgive people then your heavenly father will not forgive your wrongdoing
4458954 if christ has not been raised our preaching is useless and so is your faith

4458972 in sachen charme und anspruch k nnte das rennen in valencia dem gro en preis von monaco am n chsten kommen
4458973 ich freue mich sehr auf das rennen in valencia ich bin generell ein gro er fan von stadtkursen sie sind sehr anspruchsvoll weil sie oft wellig sind und wechselnden stra enbelag aufweisen
4458974 wenn man einen fehler macht landet man schnell an der leitplanke valencia wird nicht komplett stadtkurscharakter haben es gibt aus sicherheitsgr nden viele auslaufzonen die fia unternimmt diesbez glich gro e anstrengungen und das ist gut

4458981 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year

4458990 the egyptian air force has been a key customer of northrop grummans for
4458991 they said the border would be opened if hamas abided by the cease fire and stopped the rocket attacks on israel
4458992 they are all afraid that the reopening of the border would strengthen hamas and weaken the palestinian authority leadership in ramallah
4458993 pa president mahmoud abbas is also exerting heavy pressure on egypt not to reopen rafah he doesnt want hamas to be in control of the palestinian side of the terminal he abbas wants his men to return to the terminal as was the case before june 2007
4458994 were not completely opposed to the deployment of some of abbass loyalists at the border but we insist that such a move be done in coordination with the legitimate hamas government
4458995 the egyptian position is that the reopening of the rafah border crossing would exempt israel from fulfilling its duties toward the residents of the gaza strip
4458996 the egyptians also told us that if we wanted to import fuel gas and food we should do so only through israel because they insist that the rafah terminal be used only for the passage of civilians
4458997 ricorda solo nel buio della notte che puoi vedere le stelle e quelle stelle ti ricondurranno a casa quindi non avere paura di commettere degli errori perch il pi delle volte le ricompense pi grandi ti arrivano dallaver fatto le cose che ci mettono pi paura forse otterrai tutto quello che desideri forse otterrai addirittura di pi di quanto avevi immaginato chiss dove ti porter la vita la strada lunga e alla fine il viaggio quello che pi conta
4458998 if youre as hooked on coverage of the presidential election as i am youre probably aware of a pernicious new euphemism thats crept into the political lexicon low information voters as an abuse of the english language this may not rank with advanced interrogation techniques but it still raises my blood pressure every time i hear it i believe the more precise terminology is ignorant clowns that may sound cruel but if the media showed less sensitivity to such people perhaps there wouldnt be quite so many of them unlike blindness or retardation ignorance is easily cured ignorant clowns are but one segment of the larger more defensible group known as swing voters some of these voters are badly needed moderates in a political landscape so polarized the federal government barely functions some are intelligent reasonably well informed people who realize that both parties serve special interests and that election day is the only time independents have any power at all but some of them are just ignorant clowns more susceptible than most people to slick commercials emotional appeals and brazen distortions of fact such is the great paradox of electoral democracy by the time the polls open the voters with the most influence are those who deserve it the least
4458999 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4459000 the philosophy of materialism holds that the only things that can be truly proven to exist is matter fundamentally material composes all things and all phenomena are the result of material interactions therefore matter is the only substance and can neither be created or destroyed hence we are all made of only what came before us yet discretely conceived through form we are all made of earth and sky and stars

4459008 we dont have time now to get into long discussions on blame
4459009 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
4459010 we dont see anything that supports the russians are in gori i dont know why the georgians are saying that

4459018 the six characters last names remain the same but their first names and bios have been updated for example miss scarlet is now kasandra scarlet a famous actress often featured in tabloids and mr green is now jacob green an african american with all the ins colonel mustard is now jack mustard a former football player the professor now victor plum a billionaire video game designer
4459019 most of the western media is based in georgia the russians were slow to give access from their side and this has helped them lose the propaganda war
4459020 georgia has dominated the psychological playing field from the beginning
4459021 russias propaganda has been clumsy while georgias has been effective but both kinds pose serious problems
4459022 moscow is using novel methods to spread a very unsubtle cold war version of the caucasian conflict to the world chief among them is russia today a state 24 hour news channel that is fronted much of the time by cheery british and other english speaking television professionals the smiles and studio banter could come from bbc world or cnn but the story is unrelentingly the kremlin version
4459023 i wouldnt trust such eyewitnesses too much as many of them resemble too much goebbels propaganda trying to present white as black and vice versa trying to present a victim of an aggression as the initiator of the aggression and vice versa our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone instead they launched strikes in response to the georgian forces attacks such as artillery which were still targeting tskhinvali there was speculation panicky rumours and disinformation that russian tanks had allegedly entered gori stories of russian planes bombing tbilisi they were all goebbels style lies invented by the georgian leadership
4459024 insofar as america is seen as weak our enemies will redouble their actions and our friends will hold back fearing that association with us will not protect them and single them out for attack those consequences are immediate traveling across the airwaves of the bbc and al jazeera and the other propaganda outlets favored by our enemies

4459059 the bottom line is politics is a persuasive business the demonstration of ones ability to be persuasive is right at the core of effective politics
4459060 the truth of the matter is everybody sympathizes with senator johnson and with his physical condition everybody wants to tiptoe around that condition and they dont want to seem callous and insensitive to it
4459061 but the bottom line is people have got to wonder
4459062 a lot more people have talked to me they are looking at our web site they are researching my positions there are more editorials more appearances of my name in print over the last week and i dont see any evidence of it going away it clearly has become the issue of the campaign
4459063 i think the plan fails to uphold the intent of the highlands act
4459064 while its not hard to argue that a weak plan is better than no plan this plan is not protective of the highlands water supply and the multiple amendments which were rejected speak to that failure
4459065 were going to do what we think is right with regard to the overall issue

4459073 do you believe that the european powers should be leading the western response to russias invasion of georgia
4459074 should the u s get involved in the russia georgia crisis
4459075 several months ago we carried out an evaluation of the situation in georgia and realized that georgia and russia were on a collision course we have good relations with both and dont want to back either in this conflict
4459076 we therefore made a decision to drastically minimize sales of weapons to georgia
4459077 we saw that there was a surge in requests for weapons and we therefore decided to in effect minimize the entire issue after our decision we sold only defensive weapons in small quantities to georgia

4459132 moreover i found director giuseppe marotta the first person in the world of football to understand me and all his colleagues
4459133 as soon as i make a mistake he sends me a message to let me now that they are close to me thats never happened to me
4459134 ive told the director well stay here for life him and me and ill stop at 34 and see what happens
4459135 i gave up a lot of money for happiness which doesnt have a price
4459136 i found happiness here even if i played at the most important club in the world real madrid where many would pay to be able to go to
4459137 but for me samp is the most important club they gave me life faith they restored my smile
4459138 with all respect to those who dont have much money matters little to me
4459139 i wont ever forget my first day here four or five thousand people welcomed me just when i needed affection they are my people i am their footballer
4459140 we can do well this season we will fight again to reach the uefa cup like we did last year
4459141 but my dream is to wear this shirt in the champions league in about two or three years it would be like winning a world cup
4459142 inter have 25 incredible players and moreover a coach with guts
4459143 whenever hes made a promise hes always kept it winning everything
4459144 i think that inter in the next three years can really take home every trophy
4459145 i feel i have improved as a man since i have been at samp
4459146 if before i did 10 idiotic things a day now i only do five
4459147 but i havent changed my nature is like that even if its right that one improves with time otherwise you havent learnt anything from life
4459148 ive had pressure on me since i was born every game i always have to demonstrate something because everybody will look at any mistake i make with a microscope
4459149 even when im walking down the street i have to show people what im not im used to these things
4459150 now im only interested in being well physically on the pitch i dont have to learn anything from anybody
4459151 ive always said to marotta imagine that with all the stupid things ive done i went and played at real
4459152 theoretically everyone can win the premier league realistically they cannot
4459153 i call it the tiger woods factor tiger woods winning every week does not reduce interest it creates interest
4459154 last season was fantastic everything was played out right to the end with so much was at stake then two of our clubs reached the champions league final
4459155 it will be difficult to have another season as good as that again
4459156 what we must avoid is one club winning it on a sustained basis
4459157 but i have seen manchester united win it three times on the trot and chelsea win it twice
4459158 on both occasions people said they will win it 10 years in a row even united fans were saying they would not get anywhere near chelsea but look what happened
4459159 it was an idea to look at but it was almost as if the players were boarding the plane
4459160 but we cannot just throw the concept away say no more international thoughts and just carry on
4459161 it is hard to appreciate what a phenomenon we are we are an export any country in the world knows about the premier league and we want to keep it that way
4459162 we have said we will put something together in february that will be a little bit more concrete until then nothing will be ruled out or in
4459163 there is a strategic opportunity to develop our second and third tier clubs
4459164 this idea would get them closer to the big four the way we work the money we gain internationally gets divided equally
4459165 when i first heard the song i said wow this girl is angry and then i said oh man i think its alanis

4459172 all of the sudden i realized that i had just done something that separated me from the human race and it was something that could never be undone i realized that from that point on i could never be like normal people i must have stood there in that state for 20 minutes i have never felt an emptiness of self like i did right then and i never will forget that feeling it was like i crossed over into a realm i could never come back from

4459177 im detail muss jedoch beachtet werden dass die verbraucher auch weiterhin qualit tsvergleiche anstellen

4459183 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4459184 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4459185 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4459186 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4459187 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4459188 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4459189 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4459191 15 08 2008 hezbollah secretary general sayyed hasan nasrallah addressed the lebanese thursday night in a televised speech to mark the 2nd anniversary of the 2006 victory on israel the results of the war are evident even today in both the military and political fields in israel
4459192 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
4459193 he has worked today and it went very well and he seems in great form
4459194 there is no decision on whether he will run at york yet
4459195 i will be speaking to john ferguson bloodstock advisor to sheikh mohammed tomorrow and we will make a decision then
4459196 he has played at a high level in the bundesliga premier league and the american national team
4459197 he is an exciting player that i am looking forward to seeing
4459198 agf is a club on the way up where i feel i fit well in and can perform my best
4459199 i have heard very good things about the danish league which i am looking forward to playing in
4459200 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
4459201 it will be an authentic street circuit in the sense that it runs through the town centre unlike the melbourne or montreal tracks
4459202 in terms of its charms and challenges the valencia race will probably come closest to the monaco grand prix
4459203 the first few metres in a brand new car are always a very special experience
4459204 early this year i spent a few days in valencia with my family between the rollout and the next test we had a great time went to the beach and in town theres a dried out riverbed that has nature parks and playgrounds
4459205 that was very nice especially for the children valencia is also a great place for shopping and eating out needless to say and i love the contrast between its historic and futuristic architecture im looking forward to the weekend
4459206 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
4459207 they are very demanding as they are often bumpy and the street surface changes when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers
4459208 anyway valencia will not be a complete street circuit there will be lots of run off areas for safety reasons the fia puts a lot of effort into safety which is good
4459209 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style setanta readers comment of the day
4459210 hold my breath as i wish for death oh please god wake me
4459211 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4459212 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4459213 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4459214 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4459215 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4459216 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4459217 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4459218 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4459219 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4459220 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4459221 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4459222 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4459223 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4459224 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4459225 who are open to doing something on the production side
4459226 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4459227 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4459228 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4459229 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4459238 weil in den vergangenen jahrzehnten verst rkt j ngere abgewandert sind schuld war vor allem die schlechte erwerbssituation au erdem liegt die zahl der studienpl tze im ruhrgebiet immer noch weit unter dem landesdurchschnitt
4459239 dass die haushaltszahlen zurzeit noch steigen stimmt nat rlich aber es ist ein durchschnittswert f r die h lfte der region trifft das schon jetzt nicht mehr zu
4459240 es kann doch nicht wahr sein dass wir erst dann t tig werden wenn wir die gleichen leerstandsquoten haben wie in den neuen bundesl ndern

4459246 there is no divide between our common desire to make the border region an economic powerhouse
4459247 we know that when storms or other natural disasters occur they do not respect political boundaries

4459252 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there
4459253 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4459254 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4459255 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4459256 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4459257 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4459258 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4459259 ganar una medalla es impresionante y jugar la final mucho m s
4459260 est claro que me gusta que entren los tiros pero no es lo que m s me preocupa me preocupan mis sensaciones me preocupa ser til al equipo creo que los puntos y el tiro son una faceta importante para un equipo y que si a veces no est s acertado concentras tus energ as en otras cosas
4459261 a lo mejor he llamado un poco m s la atenci n porque han entrado un par de tiros pero en los dos primeros partidos casi no he anotado y creo que he ayudado al equipo cada d a estoy preparado y en una cancha de baloncesto hay muchas cosas que hacer adem s de meter puntos
4459262 los rivales tambi n juegan y a todo el mundo le gustar a empezar el partido sacar veinte y aguantar as los cuarenta minutos pero no es f cil
4459263 ellos alemania son muy buen equipo y a las nueve de la ma ana es inc modo jugar para todos tampoco es para tirar cohetes pero estamos contentos de lo que hemos hecho en el encuentro
4459264 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4459265 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4459266 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4459267 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4459268 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4459269 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4459270 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4459271 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4459272 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4459273 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4459274 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4459275 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4459276 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4459277 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4459278 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4459279 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4459280 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4459281 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4459282 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4459283 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4459284 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4459285 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4459286 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4459287 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4459288 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4459289 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4459290 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4459291 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4459292 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4459293 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4459294 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4459295 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4459296 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4459297 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4459298 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4459299 during the course of the investigation of this matter matt celotti made an application for early discharge from the 2008 australian olympic team said team spokesman mike tancred

4459301 we found out this morning when someone from 3aw in melbourne called me that was the first we knew of it
4459302 we then called the aoc section manager and she then spoke to the athlete but we had no idea
4459303 wed hope the sport if they knew would have informed us but were not sure whether the sport knew either
4459304 we both were wearing usa and we wanted the best for each other

4459306 the mp3 floating around was the result of a late night jam session and something we did for a bit of a laugh featuring a blues riff we have been playing live recently upon which skinner recorded some vocals it is not intended to be a serious release so we are happy for it to be leaked unofficially
4459307 ive finally done it i finally bought the legendary 909 drum machine i always wanted im bringin it home for the final streets album not this one you might have to wait two years for this shit its gonna be called computers and blues and its all about dancing and chatting shit 45 minutes of 130 bpm style straight spittin

4459312 i told him that we had an offer of 32million euros from
4459313 he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4459314 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100 million he was very emphatic
4459315 i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4459316 i told calderon that they are doing the same to robinho as fifa president sepp blatter said united were doing to cristiano ronaldo
4459317 they dont want to release the striker the same as united did with the portugal player
4459318 if they do not release him robinho will continue sad and in the year that comes he could leave for a sum that is much less than chelseas current offer

4459324 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding
4459325 estoy muy a gusto aqu la gente me trata muy bien por eso se renuncian a cosas pero soy joven y quiero seguir mejorando mi primera opci n era seguir en el valencia
4459326 para m la familia es lo principal siempre me han ayudado en todo es una cosa muy importante que est n muy bien como yo
4459327 tenemos un buen equipo no hay muchos fichajes este a o pero esperamos recuperar a gente para el grupo porque la temporada pasada fue complicada estamos en uefa pensamos en la liga y esperemos que lleguen momentos muy buenos
4459328 est m s tranquila y eso es lo m s importante para m
4459329 creemos que es conveniente que jozy est con el equipo el m ximo tiempo posible ya que luego tiene que volver a marcharse con su selecci n es bueno que aprovechemos esta semana para que trabaje con el grupo e incluso que pueda disputar alg n partido
4459330 es un recuerdo para siempre algo hermoso para m y estoy s per contenta de haberlo hecho
4459331 lo primero que tenemos que hacer es recuperarnos ricky rubio que ayer por el mi rcoles no pudo entrenarse ha estado en muy buena l nea f sica otra vez contra alemania aunque todav a sigue con molestias navarro sigue con problemas en un pie por una herida y carlos jim nez no ha podido jugar as que vamos a ver si nos recuperamos bien porque aqu no hay dos o tres d as de margen ni dos o tres d as de entrenamiento
4459332 el d a de entrenamiento no puede ser fuerte porque se recupera del d a anterior y se prepara el siguiente por tanto lo que tenemos que hacer es casi entrenarnos en los partidos y lo estamos intentando hacer con todas las dificultades que supone
4459333 afrontaremos el partido con el deseo de ganar sabiendo el potencial t cnico y sobre todo f sico de los americanos que es tremendo
4459334 lo dem s depende de temas econ micos y del presupuesto

4459337 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4459338 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4459339 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4459340 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4459341 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4459342 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4459343 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4459344 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4459345 there is one clear winner in the bei ca ching advertising and branding sweepstakes
4459346 yes i know they don t appear to be on any of the lists of official partners sponsors or suppliers yes i know they don t seem to be purchasing any ads but what is the one thing viewers keep seeing on such athletes as super swimmer michael phelps the distinctive white ear buds of apple s ipod
4459347 this may be the finest example of product placement in world history and it may have cost apple absolutely nothing
4459348 how do we know those ear buds are attached to an apple product i hear someone ask couldn t they actually hook up to a zune
4459349 couldn t they actually hook up to a zune well no first of all michael phelps is a winner
4459350 second and most important it doesn t matter if they re hooked up to an apple product a zune or nothing at all sorry to repeat myself the point is that apple owns the white cord and buds so when you see them you think apple i do believe they call that part of the branding thing
4459351 it takes big brains but it doesn t necessarily take a big budget
4459352 couldn t they actually hook up to a zune well no first of all michael phelps is a winner
4459353 yes i know they don t seem to be purchasing any ads
4459354 weve been working diligently over the last 10 years to secure project financing to realize the satellite constellation while simultaneously producing a wide variety of services which our own satellite imagery can soon be integrated into the combination of our frequent revisit capabilities large area coverage system reliability and the know how of our international team members and partners will open up new possibilities in management information and geo information services we wil be able to deliver imagery and services to our customers for crop planning crop identification and damage assessment following a natural disaster we can expect the satellites to be commercially operational before the end of the year which will be just as much of an important milestone for our company as the launch
4459355 this is also an important moment for us as a company
4459356 rapideye is the first operational small satellite constellation developed by mda the development of the rapideye constellation including the ground planning and processing system represents a breakthrough in offering world class data from a turn key mission we are proud to have worked with rapideye to enable their mission
4459357 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4459358 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4459359 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4459360 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4459361 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4459362 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4459363 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4459364 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe

4459385 nosotros lo hicimos con cari o y no pensando en ofender a nadie somos uno de los pa ses m s multiculturales del mundo quiz alguien tenga alg n problema con nosotros pero nosotros no tenemos ning n problema con nadie

4459391 no estoy feliz con lo que me ha deparado este torneo en los ltimos tiempos no he llevado la trayectoria esperada a pesar de que los torneos han sido en pista dura termin pronto en toronto y cincinnati tengo que buscar nuevas expectativas
4459392 la competici n sigue y est el tramo final de la temporada con el abierto de estados unidos y la copa masters en shangai
4459393 la confianza falla cuando los resultados son adversos y uno pierde partidos
4459394 no es normal estos resultados mi juego y mi r cord es muy distinto estoy lejos de esos n meros
4459395 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4459396 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4459397 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4459398 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4459399 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4459400 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4459401 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4459402 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4459403 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4459404 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4459405 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4459406 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4459407 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4459408 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4459409 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4459410 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4459411 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4459412 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4459413 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4459414 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4459415 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4459416 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4459417 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4459418 i think sen gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that
4459419 its going to be a tough race tomorrow and even though i have a 12 point margin you can never have enough
4459420 i think a top 10 medal race which scores double points notches up the pressure a bit more than for a world championship or a european championship
4459421 were prepared for it to be a close race and its not like we havent been in this position before tomorrow we have one thing to do and we know we can do it
4459422 there may be a few butterflies beforehand but i think thats healthy we want gold and will do everything to win gold

4459443 initially marshall told arriving police the girlfriends sisters attacked him with a knife cutting his hand according to a police report on the march 4 fight at his high rise atlanta condominium
4459444 but according to new documents obtained thursday when police asked who had the knife
4459445 she said they began arguing and marshall allegedly began to destroy the apartment threw her on the bed grasped her head with his hand and began to slap her according to the police report her sisters adilah watley 21 and aliyah 16 gave similar accounts of the alleged assault
4459446 basically what it was is i had just gotten into town and the relationship was basically over said marshall who owns the atlanta condo

4459498 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4459499 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls these types of areas did not fare so well in the study

4459507 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4459508 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4459509 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4459510 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4459511 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4459512 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4459513 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4459514 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4459515 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field

4459532 there are a lot of folks who want to get a divorce and the house is an impediment because nobody wants it
4459533 one of the ways they pay their legal fees is by selling or refinancing their home and selling the home is getting more difficult
4459534 its in inventory with homes that are just like it
4459535 a lot of times both of them cannot agree on what to do
4459536 it can be a huge financial mess in the past a lot of times folks wanted to keep the house and lately thats not the case
4459537 tenemos la obligaci n de que el club se estabilice y vuelva crecer
4459538 como tengo esa experiencia s que la situaci n a priori no parece demasiado f cil pero s como van a ir las cosas a partir de ahora
4459539 cuando me enter del inter s del levante me hizo ilusi n es un proyecto nuevo y pienso que a partir de ahora va a crecer
4459540 los partidos y el tiempo dar n la medida de este equipo y si funciona la gente se enganchar

4459544 we intend to take a series of steps to liquidate the fund and redeem all fund investors at the same pace
4459545 after labor day we will commence a sell down of the funds security holdings in order to raise cash to fund redemptions
4459546 its what i call real representation which is just being available for communication with residents and promoting their partnering with that representation
4459547 id do it simply by being available via phone internet being at neighborhood meetings being in the neighborhoods id hold regular meetings have newsletters a web site just to be a vigorous representative for the needs and desires of the district
4459548 i think theres been some leadership missing im an independent guy i stand up id make sure the district is getting its fair share of stuff im not sure were getting what we deserve
4459549 id open up the lines of communication between people ive had people say theyre not getting calls back from council people leadership is more than just a word
4459550 in the 5th district we intend to maintain the strong effort on enforcement that has led to the cleaning up of 12 street corners that notoriously served as headquarters for drug and crime activity
4459551 the crackdown on graffiti and other so called minor crime helps keep more serious crime at bay the police respond quickly efficiently and professionally to any call and we will support improved communications and logistics to enhance what is already successful
4459552 its just making sure we have responsible growth which encompasses several other key components like affordable housing and police and fire presence which increase as the population increases
4459553 infrastructure is a part of that as well the more people you have using more public infrastructure youre going to have to attend to maintenance and building new infrastructure
4459554 that comes into planning really sitting down and coming up with a plan of how to address those things before they hit you you begin with the budget but also with the departments where are we and how do we position ourselves to handle additional growth in the population
4459555 right now the city is in good shape ive always thought that
4459556 i thought that before the current mayor got in people are coming back to the city i think we need to continue to encourage more home ownership which is good and raises the tax base
4459557 but we need to keep tax rates low assessments go up which is good thing but we cant chase people out of the city with tax rates id like to see if we can cap tax rates for seniors
4459558 i think the first step is to have people present on council and a mayor that residents can have faith that theyre there to really turn it around and to get projects accomplished and to run things in a truly responsible way
4459559 short of that its just getting out and meeting people and shaking hands putting ideas forward and pursing them and getting them interested in partnering with city
4459560 weve got to do it as tri city area not just as richmond chesterfield or henrico some things would benefit all of us but would take all to come up with ideas and pay for it
4459561 apart from stony point mall carytown is the largest shopping center in town and the venue for the annual watermelon festival the largest one day festival on the east coast
4459562 provision of such simple amenities such as new trash containers street paving bicycle racks and sidewalk clean ups will keep people flocking to this vital area which puts so much back into the city
4459563 i want jobs for our city and job stability and homes people can afford to live in
4459564 these are economic issues and the surest way to get there is to have a strong and growing business base
4459565 as a council member our input into the management of schools is basically through fiscal management
4459566 i will continue to scrutinize school budgets to cut what is unnecessary and to increase what works and what makes life more promising for our young people
4459567 my experiences have really opened my eyes to some of the issues that should be addressed and i do believe that i could be a good part of helping richmond public schools to continue in a positive direction
4459568 there are some problems but there are some very positive things that we can also continue to grow on as we change the negative things that are affecting our school system
4459569 the only way to do that is to enforce the student code of conduct and we have to implement safety initiatives that provide alternatives for aggressive behavior
4459570 we have a lot of young people that have a lot of aggressive behavior we need to address these issues and find out whats causing it we need to sit down with them and come to some understanding we have to be very firm on discipline because with that i think we can establish a rapport of respect
4459571 a new school will provide economic benefits to the entire community because where there are good schools they will attract businesses and good businesses attract people who want to move into the city and make their home in city
4459572 i do believe that if we were to partner with others we would have large range of support and opportunities for our kids in our system
4459573 i think if business leaders are involved they would be able to educate kids in the area of business and let them know certain things that are expected to maintain decent employment in the future
4459574 civically it would let them know each of them have responsibility for our community to do what we can as an adult or a child to help make our community a better place to live
4459575 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4459576 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4459577 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault

4459650 this report clearly shows that there are alternatives to closing the emergency unit which can retain vital services locally without compromising on patient safety
4459651 it is important to emphasis that no final decisions have been taken but this report will inform future work
4459652 in reality we can expect a figure somewhere in between those two levels and for planning purposes we might expect at least half of those currently admitted to continue to be admitted
4459653 it is now for this board to take forward these new ideas to help inform a consultation that will secure a sustainable and safe long term future for the hospital backed with a programme of investment

4459664 before liberating shebaa farms it must be established that they are lebanese through the syrian governments acknowledgment by means of a joint document with the lebanese government which will be sent to the united nations
4459665 the lebanese syrian joint committee that mouallem said will work on the issue of missing persons lacks independence and it is not neutral the committees of the parents of the missing and jailed lebanese is not represented in the committee we demand the adoption of proper mechanisms to deal with this issue in accordance with international standards

4459670 the united states will soon leave the region then regional countries should fill the security vacuum there is no need for interference of other countries

4459675 i will be speaking to john ferguson bloodstock advisor to sheikh mohammed tomorrow and we will make a decision then
4459676 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it
4459677 i think the whole of formula 1 is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there
4459678 we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit
4459679 with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful
4459680 we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle
4459681 its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
4459682 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia said the brazilian
4459683 despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels
4459684 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up
4459685 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team setanta readers comment of the day
4459686 he has played at a high level in the bundesliga premier league and the american national team
4459687 he is an exciting player that i am looking forward to seeing
4459688 agf is a club on the way up where i feel i fit well in and can perform my best
4459689 i have heard very good things about the danish league which i am looking forward to playing in
4459690 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
4459691 it will be an authentic street circuit in the sense that it runs through the town centre unlike the melbourne or montreal tracks
4459692 in terms of its charms and challenges the valencia race will probably come closest to the monaco grand prix
4459693 the first few metres in a brand new car are always a very special experience
4459694 early this year i spent a few days in valencia with my family between the rollout and the next test we had a great time went to the beach and in town theres a dried out riverbed that has nature parks and playgrounds
4459695 that was very nice especially for the children valencia is also a great place for shopping and eating out needless to say and i love the contrast between its historic and futuristic architecture im looking forward to the weekend
4459696 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
4459697 they are very demanding as they are often bumpy and the street surface changes when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers
4459698 anyway valencia will not be a complete street circuit there will be lots of run off areas for safety reasons the fia puts a lot of effort into safety which is good
4459699 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style setanta readers comment of the day

4459753 travellers who had earlier shifted from second ac and third ac to low cost airlines are now coming back to the railways owing to the rise in airfares in the past few months
4459754 when low cost flights were introduced many people who travelled by ac ii and ac iii went for air travel as they were inexpensive now with the increase in airfare they have reverted to train travel
4459755 the increase in airfares is not the only reason why people are choosing our premier trains we have also taken measures to increase passenger comfort and cater to the increased demand by adding extra coaches
4459756 talk to your kids about your situation if you are in financial difficulty

4459768 the wizzard media player is expected to attract video producers with its innovative functionality and highly customizable features
4459769 the wizzard media player allows for unprecedented producer control and customization it incorporates all of the best features i have seen in other web video players and several that are innovative and unique
4459770 i expect a surge of content producers moving to this media player it has been my pleasure to work with wizzard in the development of a media player that exceeds my own lofty expectations it is exactly what i was looking for
4459771 the goal for wizzard is to bring the latest cutting edge video technologies to video producers and their audiences without sacrificing backward compatibility for legacy users

4459774 were just trying to see the situation on the ground
4459775 we need to take some bold transformative steps we need to find some potential areas to invest and see some long term dividends
4459776 we need almost a new deal type investment in alternative resources
4459777 honey ive been here for 85 years i would never leave
4459778 i see where the hope and potential is you have a system in place here
4459779 the problems that used to be associated with places like detroit or toledo are now felt across the board
4459780 we recognize theres a lot of competition for these funds
4459781 thats my biggest concern that well lose the momentum that we have now
4459782 you owe it to yourselves and your neighbors and the world to preserve this
4459783 lake tahoe is one of the most beloved and special places on earth
4459784 but the lake and surrounding basin are natural treasures at risk
4459785 as stewards of this jewel of the sierra it is our responsibility to do everything we can to preserve the lake
4459786 you cant think of the long term without recognizing climate change
4459787 the big buzz we should and need to focus on is preventing these invaders from coming into the lake
4459788 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4459789 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4459790 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4459791 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4459792 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4459793 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4459794 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4459795 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4459796 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
4459797 the 28 youngsters under 45 collectively enjoyed a 5 9 per cent increase in overall compensation
4459798 though it takes a lot of time to learn a business inside and out earn the respect of the board and perhaps the hardest of all win the hearts of employees
4459799 excluding four founding entrepreneurs including 39 year old yahoo chief jerry yang and nvidias huang the 45 and under set spent an average of nine years climbing the ranks before moving into their corner offices
4459800 strong economic fundamentals such as continuing high employment levels rising incomes and low mortgage rates will provide a solid foundation for healthy housing markets this year
4459801 increased competition from the existing home market coupled with the elimination of the pent up demand that built up during the 1990s will exert downward pressure on housing starts which will decline to 194 000 units in 2009 from 215 000 in 2008
4459802 there was a sense that we have got to do something the conservatives in the state had gone so far to the right that it was just out of control they believed the number one threat to colorado was gay marriage and whether they posted the ten commandments in the public schools just absurd considering even at that time the huge number of foreclosures not to mention health care
4459803 mccains going to prevail the more people see of obama in the general race they start to see him as very left wing
4459804 even with a strong progressive infrastructure when it comes to presidential politics there are so many other things that decide it
4459805 he is one of the great american leaders whose support of the jewish state is inviolable
4459806 it would be very problematic for israel to give up the west bank from their own standpoint of security the same thing with the golan heights giving up the golan heights makes most of the galilee a sitting target
4459807 there is an enormous amount of land in arab control all over the middle east and to say that it a palestinian state has to be on the west bank limits the capacity to bring some type of resolution but lets be honest there is not going to be some instant kumbaya moment where everybody builds the campfire toasts marshmallows and sings holding hands this conflict is not new it has been going on since all the way to the time of abraham and its not going to be resolved any time in the immediate future
4459808 i think hes a great man and if john mccain as president picked him to be secretary of state or some other cabinet position i dont think anyone has a problem with that but i dont know that he would be a good fit to be vice president
4459809 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4459810 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4459811 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying
4459812 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4459813 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4459814 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4459815 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4459816 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4459817 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4459818 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4459819 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4459820 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4459821 es ist in china eine tradition bei auff hrungen dass verschiedene trachten getragen werden um zu symbolisieren dass die volksgruppen freundlich und gl cklich zusammenleben

4459828 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4459829 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4459830 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4459831 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4459832 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4459833 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4459834 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4459835 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4459836 had thought a great deal about the potential of the vice presidency carter talked at length about how he saw the office as a wasted national asset he was determined to use his vice presidency in a way no president had done previously
4459837 made it clear to carter that he did not want to be considered if it was to be a strictly ceremonial office he was only interested in a truly substantive role
4459838 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4459839 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4459840 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4459841 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4459842 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4459843 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4459844 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4459845 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4459846 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4459847 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4459848 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4459849 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4459850 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4459851 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4459852 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4459853 for us to be anywhere close to double digits represented a huge change from the past
4459854 now in august weve had two new polls one showing about a 6 point lead one a 7 point lead
4459855 but franklin said there has been a shift statewide in party identification
4459856 so the upshot of that is theres been a shift in party balance over the last four years that could be very important to the state and democratic candidates in the state
4459857 i think the polls that come out a week or two after the conventions are going to be critical for telling us whether were going to be again one of these competitive swing states or whether the state has shifted enough that one candidate or the other will maintain a lead
4459858 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4459859 the last eight years have been nothing short of a disaster
4459860 we need a new start not only domestically but internationally
4459861 i am very delighted to see that the obamas campaign has reached out to many community activists from all asian american and pacific islander communities including those who erstwhile were ardent supporters of hillary clinton and john edwards
4459862 is from a new generation of leaders as immigrants to this country we can easily identify ourselves with his life story he is an inspiration for our children born here that is perhaps the reason why so many of young generation indian americans have flocked to his campaign obama has also surrounded himself with many political veterans of indian origin
4459863 each of these individuals are deeply committed to ensuring that the rapidly growing south asian american communities are engaged and participating in this years historic elections
4459864 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4459865 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4459866 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4459867 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4459868 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4459869 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4459870 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4459871 i want them to know i am sorry it has taken a great toll on them
4459872 somewhere along the way i lost my path i made horrible decisions
4459873 this is a sad case its obvious that you have good skills
4459874 you destroyed the most valuable asset that you possess your good name
4459875 he was not saying oh im sorry i was arrested
4459876 his crime wasnt just ripping people off hes left a trail of devastation in his wake boarded up buildings are going to stay that way for years to come thats what hes done for his community
4459877 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4459878 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4459879 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4459880 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4459881 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4459882 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4459883 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4459884 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4459885 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4459886 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours

4459895 los trajes de ba o de la sharia no son pr cticos
4459896 el objetivo es mostrarle a la gente que aqu est pasando algo mostrarle los sucios secretos que la gran mayor a de la gente desconoce
4459897 cuando hablamos de turismo y la gente viene a visitar los ngeles no van a los lugares desagradables
4459898 la yuxtaposici n de una refiner a y un barrio residencial me impact
4459899 dieses gegenseitige erschie ungskommando ist unattraktiv unprofessionell skrupellos und unakzeptabel
4459900 verwurzelung in den grundlegenden amerikanischen werten und der kultur ist allenfalls begrenzt
4459901 er lieferte keine starken und berzeugenden argumente um dem designierten kandidaten den r cken zu st rken
4459902 statt dessen konzentrierte er sich auf sein lieblingsthema sich selbst
4459903 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4459904 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4459905 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4459906 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4459907 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4459908 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4459909 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4459910 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4459911 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4459912 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4459913 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4459914 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4459915 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4459916 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4459917 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4459918 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4459919 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4459920 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4459921 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4459922 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4459923 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4459924 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4459925 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4459926 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4459927 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4459928 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4459929 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4459930 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4459931 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4459932 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4459933 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4459934 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4459935 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position

4459944 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4459945 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum

4459974 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4459975 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
