3540002 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3540003 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3540004 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3540005 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3540006 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3540007 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3540008 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3540009 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3540010 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3540011 ley para la promoci n de la organizaci n de los productores agrarios y la consolidaci n de la propiedad rural para el cr dito agrario
3540012 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3540013 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3540014 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3540015 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3540016 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3540017 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3540018 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3540019 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3540020 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3540021 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3540022 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3540023 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3540024 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3540025 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3540026 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3540027 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3540028 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3540029 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3540030 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3540031 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3540032 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3540033 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3540034 going forward were now without a city manager were minus two council members and we are facing another election
3540035 the past seven months i found myself in the middle of this game that i refuse to play
3540036 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3540037 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3540038 god bless our government troops and people dont like it its a free country move out
3540039 next time you guys are here lets come back and bring a picnic
3540040 this is not the tombstone i ordered wheres the cheese and pepperoni
3540041 que el zulia es la piedra en el zapato de ellos porque vienen otra vez con la reforma constitucional con la intenci n de nombrar un presidente para toda la vida vienen con todo para acabar con la propiedad privada para acabar con la autonom a del banco central de venezuela
3540042 we think its long past time for the u s to adopt a national broadband policy so that we can have affordable quality high speed internet available to everybody in america this is the infrastructure of the 21st century in the same way that the government helped build roads and canals and railroads and assured that every american has affordable telephone service its now time to make sure that every american can participate in the information age
3540043 they dont have anything else for him to do so hes sitting in china watching games
3540044 i was absolutely thrilled to see angelina jolie lindsay and sam haunt lax
3540045 they dont have anything else for him to do so hes sitting in china watching games
3540046 apart from short sections in the prison service orders on disability and women there remains no national strategy for older prisoners
3540047 there is still far too much reliance on the unsupported initiative of particularly committed officers and too great an assumption that the care of older prisoners including their social care is a matter for health services and not for the whole prison
3540048 an ageing prison population is being squeezed into overcrowded jails designed and run for young men
3540049 as well greater use of community punishments for older offenders ministers should also consider developing specialist secure accommodation for the elderly in cases where a custodial sentence is necessary
3540050 the national offender management service has felt to date that a national strategy for older prisoners was not appropriate
3540051 every single polling place of the 98 we have opened on time and everyone showed up
3540052 theres kind of a uniqueness to first person shooters in that they lend themselves nicely to all kinds of games within a game from an ads perspective
3540053 the most progressive publisher in the in game ad space
3540054 i guess i view this as kind of a value add for those that want to self select into the game within the game
3540055 for those that dont its not going to bother anybody as any consumer can avoid messaging in any other media format
3540056 were in talks with sony frequently on a number of issues while we are a microsoft owned company and i realize theres competition between consoles we just say can we provide through advertising value back to the publisher perhaps to the platform and hopefully do cool stuff for the gamer
3540057 if the gamer doesnt like what we do then its a house of cards
3540058 if the environment is ad relevant they actually prefer to see real brands and real messaging that mirrors their terrestrial experience versus fake stuff
3540059 the city of madison and dane county have been leaders in the nation on protecting people from mercury but we want to do even more
3540060 our goal is to reduce our carbon footprint on the environment
3540061 these efforts are our commitment to the environment but are good core practices
3540062 weve got to begin somewhere it begins with good businesses like coca cola
3540063 if we were able to cut our gas use by 32 percent we would cut 4 to 5 million barrels of oil per day
3540064 there are no seat belts on the buses no standards for windows the windows will break and bodies will fly out the window something has to be done
3540065 cant you hear my heart beat for the very first time
3540066 in the last couple of seasons ive always gone into competitions as if it were my last
3540067 i am not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against standard liege tomorrow i am only concentrating on this game
3540068 and i have not needed to contact the owners because they cannot help with the preparation for this match i prefer not to say anything else
3540069 i was really calm last week and i am concentrating on the game
3540070 hes the man hes been there before hes been around the block a few times
3540071 but when youve got him in your side youve always got a chance the gaffer has brought quality in as well
3540072 the gaffer has tried to give him days off and he wont have them
3540073 he works hard hes never been the quickest so hes not lost his legs in that respect and he sets standards in our football club
3540074 it would be typical of him to score the opening goal
3540075 there have been a lot of rumours flying around but i am not going anywhere and i dont anticipate going anywhere
3540076 there is a job to do here and i am looking forward to it
3540077 there is speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i joined the club but from my own point of view i am very focused on what i am about and what i aim to achieve here and that means success on the pitch
3540078 nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club
3540079 the door is shut now the players cant go full stop
3540080 clubs are trying to unsettle some of my players i dont like it its my first job in the premier league and the last thing i want to do is sell my best players
3540081 benni is definitely one of them and theres plenty more
3540082 we have submitted a bid and we are waiting for arsenal to respond
3540083 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
3540084 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
3540085 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
3540086 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees
3540087 i think his followers have a different sexual preference than most men
3540088 im not qualified to write for online media let alone mainstream media
3540089 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3540090 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3540091 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3540092 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3540093 the english are the greatest sea pirates who ever have lived

3540096 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we gelatopocalpyse with ciao bella
3540097 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire
3540098 learning that my husband and i had diabetes was very nerve wracking i didnt know what to do next
3540099 most of the people that take the class knew they had diabetes but didnt know what to do about it
3540100 the health system in the united states focuses on diagnosis and treatment but if we educate people on prevention they can take charge of their health
3540101 although we didnt evaluate the quality of the information presented by the media 41 percent of people said they acted on that information changing their diet and exercising or seeking more information from their physician
3540102 without regular check ups it is more difficult to diagnose chronic diseases in time
3540103 high blood pressure and sugar imbalances are less likely to be felt by individuals until they are a real problem

3540111 if the house republicans lose five seats this november the few remaining of the house republicans will be no more than empty carcasses
3540112 if we lose five seats the chance of maintaining a veto ever again under our governor is done finished extinct
3540113 there is a clear and present danger in this purple state we call home and it is the possibility of a dfl controlled house and senate that can override every veto by governor pawlenty if that happens we may as well be extinct
3540114 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime

3540117 he heard a scraping sound on the roof of the car

3540122 hes not a hothead thats russian propaganda thats the way they would like to see him portrayed in the west
3540123 but i think it was a mistake for him to act as he did and the better policy would have been to show restraint did he make a tactical blunder the answer is almost certainly yes but i dont think it was more than a tactical blunder
3540124 i think he knew the russians were looking for an opportunity or a pretext to seize south ossetia and abkhazia he felt he had a last opportunity to consolidate south ossetia because the russian plan was already laid
3540125 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3540126 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3540127 it would be impossible to clean the water in the manila bay as long as domestic wastes flow into the canals into the pasig river and into manila bay
3540128 we have turned the manila bay into a toilet bowl which is not even flushed
3540129 unfortunately in the ethnic cleansing being carried out by the burmese military junta in eastern burma rape is being used as a tool of war as it is in darfur
3540130 the obvious purpose in my view is to destroy the fabric of the community if the women are raped they are obviously shamed in the eyes of their community often times the husbands divorce the women who are left alone
3540131 victimized by the fighters and then be victimized by the men that you love
3540132 it is very very painful and for the women it is pain you live with all your life
3540133 as for the girls you can imagine the trauma and sometimes i would look at the eyes of the women in the camp and just wonder whether she is one of those who was raped and what is going on in her heart and mind
3540134 within the space of the hour that i had with them ive heard of seven tell the stories of their gang rape
3540135 one woman was 35 years old and she had been raped by several of the janjaweed arab militia in sudan and by the time she saw her husband he already knew she was raped and he divorced her on the spot leaving her with eight children
3540136 obviously if you do this to enough communities you destroy the family you destroy the fabric of a community and if you do it throughout enough villages you can shred the fabric of an ethnic group which is what they are doing in darfur and which is what they have done in the eastern part of burma
3540137 this young woman was going to stand up and struggle for her sister for her community showing again the resilience in the face of such brutality which amazes me
3540138 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3540139 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3540140 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3540141 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3540142 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3540143 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3540144 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3540145 the platform is a switchboard between anything in the world that can update or use location information
3540146 we wanted to build the platform and make it open so others could build on it
3540147 oh please dear sir could you spare a little piece of your asphalt
3540148 hes a proven big league pitcher at a time in which its hard to find pitching hes always pitched well
3540149 hes healthy now after the surgery its just he needs to build up his arm strength i dont know if theres enough time to do it but we also figure that we dont have anything to lose to try hes a guy that weve always liked
3540150 right now im feeling really good i need to throw innings so ill throw some innings at lakeland
3540151 i think its a shot i think freddy took a shot and obviously thought enough of us to sign with us and certainly we thought enough to sign him
3540152 take a shot see what happens i dont think either party has anything to lose but i think its a good deal for both parties
3540153 he has shown a lot of improvement the last few times and people feel hes ready to pitch there toledo

3540168 im delighted for callum i live in preston and people are always talking about him
3540169 he would have become a regular for scotland if it hadnt been for injury
3540170 many people may not remember but he played for scotland in the last game that we played england in the european championship play off in 1999
3540171 paul ritchie did a man marking job in the first game at hampden but we lost 2 0 and so we had to go for it at wembley
3540172 we wanted to be more offensive so i played callum at left back and he was up against david beckham and had an outstanding game that night
3540173 hes a versatile player and had a great season for preston last season often playing in midfield
3540174 he came to preston with an injury so initially it was a pay as you play deal but he did so well that billy davies gave him a contract
3540175 hes still a fit boy at 32 and im pleased that hes back hes a great lad
3540176 andy goram don hutchison and stuart mccall all had english accents and they werent bad players for scotland were they
3540177 so there will be no problem for kris and the fans will like him
3540178 i watched him play for nottingham forest last season and he was outstanding
3540179 he is a stockier version of john collins a left side midfielder who plays from middle to front
3540180 hes mobile powerful got a good left foot and he can create and score goals so he will do fine
3540181 my job is to try to help clubs produce scottish players and give them an opportunity to play for their country
3540182 if they get opportunities for their clubs especially on a big stage with a team like rangers that can only be good for the scottish game
3540183 finances in england are huge because of the tv money and the income they bring in thats the reality
3540184 players do leave but good players come in as well the spl is a very competitive league it was tremendous last season going to the last game and there was some exciting football
3540185 i said at the time when barry got injured that it would be a huge loss for scottish football both for rangers and for scotland
3540186 it has been shown how much rangers have missed him but we cant do anything about it
3540187 barry is working hard on his rehabilitation and hopefully he will have a speedy recovery but he has to be right before he can play and that could be another couple of months
3540188 we have other players in our squad who we feel are very capable in that department ive still got selection problems in terms of who to leave out so weve got players who can fill that role
3540189 as a country we are fortunate to have so many outstanding midfield players i think ive got the midfield squad to cope while rangers got a few injuries at the worst possible time for them
3540190 we have a number of older players with experience who i know can do the job
3540191 certainly for the world cup qualifiers ill have a look at things and it might be a case of bringing more experience in
3540192 none of these players have been ruled out but ive taken the opportunity to bring younger players in to have a look at knowing ill probably bring one or two more experienced players in for the world cup qualifiers
3540193 weve brought a few new players into the squad and the game is only two and a half weeks before the world cup qualifiers start
3540194 ill be looking for a positive game in terms of hopefully winning the game which i think would be important and in terms of being a bit more positive in our attacking play
3540195 i watched northern ireland on video beating georgia 4 1 and they were excellent so its going to be a tough game i know they are bringing 5 000 or 6 000 fans and im sure there will be a good turn out
3540196 im certainly looking for a positive game we will take the opportunity to have a look at one or two players but the nucleus of the squad for the macedonia game will be playing
3540197 i might introduce one or two experienced players for the world cup but there wont be major changes
3540198 its a game that we can go out and enjoy we could get a result get a draw and take them to penalties who knows
3540199 its lovely its on sky good for the supporters also as they will be watching players that played in the premier league last season it should be a good game
3540200 its a game we want to win and well try and have a very good football match well be looking forward to it
3540201 this date is not only a celebration of the clubs past but signals the beginning of a new era at coventry city
3540202 we all know about the troubles the club has faced in recent years but with a new chairman and an exciting new squad and management team in place i believe we can look forward to a successful future both on and off the field
3540203 we saw the effect a good cup run can have on the city when 11 000 supporters travelled to watch us beat manchester united last season and i hope our fans will show the same level of support on wednesday night and join us in celebrating this important date in our history
3540204 personally i think last season and the season before i laid down benchmarks but i have to look for improvement
3540205 i watched city recently against ac milan and saw joe hart in good form capello has to be happy with the state of english goalkeepers
3540206 i sat down with our goalkeeping coach david coles a couple of days ago and we had a good chat about how pre season was going
3540207 i said to him then i feel good there were a few things early on against manchester united which werent great but i am on the road to improvement and it was nice for 90 minutes to hold out
3540208 my missus stopped me watching too many games and my kids stopped me because they wanted to go out for meals
3540209 the qualification for the world cup with the international team is a major must i dont like summer holidays and we have had the longest summer holiday we have had for many a year
3540210 hopefully we can put things right with the england qualifying games coming up and in two years time hopefully i will have a busy summer
3540211 you want to do well in every game but unless you win it it becomes a big ask
3540212 europe is a double edged sword we have a uefa cup bid and that is going to put a strain on us with the amount of games and the size of our squad
3540213 middlesbrough proved you can go so far in the uefa cup but unless you win it it becomes a bit of a fruitless task and for us it is going to be important we keep our players fit to do well in europe and on the other front do well in the league
3540214 we finished eighth last year but it was slightly misleading because with three games to go we lost all three and our focus was more on the fa cup
3540215 we have submitted a bid and we are waiting for arsenal to respond
3540216 what i see is they have failed to diversify into areas where they could be making more money
3540217 there is nothing additional to say about staffing changes it continues to be a challenging time for micron
3540218 weve seen just tremendous expansion in manufacturing in the asian factories and so theres huge competition in this market
3540219 as the market heats up and competitors get out of the business as the overstock gets sold off then prices will come up and they have to come up otherwise theyre will be no manufactures left
3540220 i would still like to strengthen and im confident well bring in at least two possibly three more faces
3540221 if those players are of the quality of the likes of gutierrez and guthrie then well take our chances add to that all the players weve got to come back then weve got a strong quality squad with competition for places
3540222 our supporters have already had a glimpse of steve in our pre season friendly against wigan athletic and im sure they will appreciate that he is a quick and exciting forward
3540223 we are delighted to have such a highly rated player at hibernian for the season
3540224 kami sudah menunggu kesempatan ini selama dua tahun untuk kembali ke liga champions kami siap dan para pemain punya semangat yang bagus bagi sebagian besar pemain pertandingan ini akan menjadi kesempatan emas untuk meraih gelar juara sebagai bayaran atas pengorbanan selama dua tahun absen tak ada yang akan melewatkan kesempatan emas ini meski kami tetap menghormati lawan
3540225 saya tahu pergantian pemain sangat penting sangat logis seorang pelatih berharap semua pemainnya siap bermain tapi inilah sepakbola terkadang kita tak bisa meenurunkan beberapa pemain tapi saya sudah punya rancangan tim yang akan kami turunkan
3540226 kami menghormati kemampuan lawan mereka sudah mencetak 10 gol di babak penyisihan dua tahun lalu artmedia juga tampil bagus mereka mengalahkan celtic 5 0 dan menang 3 2 secara agregat lawan fc porto mereka memiliki empat atau lima pemain yang sangat menarik
3540227 saya akhirnya bayar juga sebab anak saya dimintai terus sama gurunya
3540228 kalau perpisahan kan bisa di sekolah saja tidak perlu ke luar kota
3540229 saat rapat bersama orangtua murid semua menyatakan setuju tidak ada yang keberatan dan kita juga bilang ini sumbangan bukan iuran wajib jadi sifatnya sukarela
3540230 kalau dipaksa setelah tanggal 10 saya masih akan minta tapi ini kan tidak
3540231 kami tidak mengambil keuntungan sepeser pun dari acara ini justru kami pengurus yang keluar uang untuk ini sebab kami peduli kepada pengajar
3540232 saya hanya mengetahui asalkan tidak memaksa dan memberatkan saya persilakan tapi masalah berapa yang terkumpul saya tidak tahu sama sekali
3540233 ada orangtua yang anaknya tiga di sekolah ini dia cuma bayar rp 30 000 itu berarti cuma rp 10 000 per anak
3540234 mungkin orangtua itu tidak mendapat pesan yang jelas dari kami atau mungkin tidak datang dalam rapat
3540235 im lost could you help me find my way to xxx
3540236 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3540237 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3540238 boeing fears that the bush administration has made up its mind on what tanker it wants and so all of these meetings will have no real bearing on the outcome of the competition

3540240 some american cases of attempted infiltration since 2001 that have been made public
3540241 investigators suspect espionage is probable as she produced highly sensitive health hazard documents for toxic compounds and chemical pesticides ms tehseen also was an expert in parasitology as it relates to public water systems
3540242 damn thats their problem theyre going through all that as a team trying to figure out if brett favre or aaron rodgers was the man while weve got the same team we had all offseason im glad they got all that darn press cause when we go down there itll be the kids first start and his first damn loss
3540243 playing green bay on monday night to start the season thats everything you want hopefully i can put my helmet square in the back of his rodgers spine if i can do that and knock the ball loose itll be a good day
3540244 we will be basically just ramping up our production and carrying it out to capacity so it wouldnt be a strain but it would be a welcome opportunity
3540245 when we go back online our line will be enhanced with those improvements
3540246 well also do some minor adjustments to ensure that when we do produce tundras all tundras here well be prepared to do that at the number we expect
3540247 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident

3540322 its making it possible for every kid in brazil to know their songs by the time they turn five
3540323 its actually good for a lot of money you give it away and it will come back thats literally true with information not with property
3540324 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
3540325 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
3540326 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists
3540327 before you couldnt get your record played on the radio if you couldnt afford payola now if a song hits big with the aparelhagens the radio has no choice but to play it

3540383 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3540384 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3540385 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3540386 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3540387 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3540388 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3540389 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3540390 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3540391 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3540392 we believe that standard chartered needs to strengthen its equity tier 1 ratio from the current level of 6 1 per cent which puts it close to the bottom versus 70 asian banks under coverage
3540393 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage
3540394 will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3540395 worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3540396 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3540397 weakening consumer spending will likely hurt all ad categories in 2008 we think 2009 may be just as bad if not worse
3540398 relative upside at the other end of this tunnel with regional newspapers retaining local higher priced advertising
3540399 our view is that micro focus is very well attuned to the current economic climate anticipating that the market and operational commentary should remain positive we retain our buy
3540400 doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results
3540401 calls for photographing and scanning the license plates of cars and trucks at all bridges and tunnels and using sensors to detect the presence of radioactivity
3540402 let me give you a piece of advice about your washing machine it too requires zero emotional intelligence but shell do more than kiss if you lean on her just so

3540623 the global nature of climate change warrants investigation of statewide thresholds of significance for ghg emissions
3540624 ceqa can be a more effective tool for ghg emission analysis and mitigation if it is supported and implemented by sound development policies that will reduce ghg emissions on a broad planning scale and that can provide the basis for a programmatic approach to project specific ceqa analysis and mitigation

3540649 whenever we talk to developers one of the major pain points that they face is deployment of their net applications due to the time it takes to install the net framework this is something we know we needed to work on and have delivered a great solution in sp1 with the net framework client profile

3540669 they are seeing unprecedented demand says cote adding that there appears to be no signs of a let up yet cote a former t mobile executive has been extremely accurate with wireless predictions in the past
3540670 the blistering sales pace of apples new gadget defies the otherwise downward trends in consumer spending employment levels and overall economic health the 3 million figure is much higher than wall street analysts had anticipated forecasts called for total quarterly sales of three million to four million
3540671 three days after the new iphones july 11 debut apple announced that it had sold 1 million iphones
3540672 the demand is so strong it may impact or delay the new countries coming on cote says

3540704 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3540705 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3540706 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3540707 present came only weeks after lawmakers got 3 8 percent cost of living increases on july 1 that bumped the based salary of a rank and file lawmaker to 67 833 and legislative leaders close to 100 000
3540708 its a sham its a shame its a farce it is clearly designed to score points and it amplifies the infighting going on between the speaker and the governor
3540709 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3540710 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3540711 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3540712 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3540713 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3540714 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3540715 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3540716 i was watching mike brian and my brother and i was saying to my mom as we went to the opening ceremonies i want to be an olympian and i want to represent the usa and how can i do it there was no womens hockey and im a 15 year old kid thinking i can conquer the world
3540717 its special for me because i remember her playing hockey with all the boys
3540718 i remember her changing her name to carl to play in a tournament because girls werent allowed to play i saw her putting her ponytail under her helmet so nobody would know she was a girl i saw all that theres someone who plays hockey for the love of the game
3540719 and its not just cammi but all the girls who played in the first olympics and world championships they didnt play for any other reason except they loved the game what they did for the womens game and womens sports you cant take your hat off enough
3540720 what do you mean youre going to play for the blackhawks well why not
3540721 well why not im a good player so all along thats the way it was she taught me a lot about the fire inside the drive to motivate yourself
3540722 going into that locker room and sharing so many of those same stories with all those girls who played growing up with boys people told them they shouldnt play that we should quit its a mans sport we all had the same exact stories
3540723 the biggest change for hockey i noticed was when we returned from nagano in 98 because all of a sudden our sport had credibility
3540724 if we carried a hockey bag into the arena people didnt look at us funny and there was now a respect to our sport its been growing steadily since then
3540725 there were a lot of proud guys in that locker room
3540726 and when i look back on it i still have that same feeling about that team and that time
3540727 and it was instantly hilarious that team was so much fun to be on the ice with
3540728 usa hockey showed faith they saw a young kid and his ability which isnt always easy to do
3540729 especially now that im a gm in the nhl to just look and see potential is a difficult thing to see
3540730 there was a lot of booing but you know what the greatest part of that was they never once said anything they never booed until we became that team that was able to beat canada and when they got scared of us as a group playing against us thats when they started that was a great feeling because we knew that we were a great team and i think the rest of the guys realized they were booing because they were afraid of us that really made me feel good and i think down it made the other guys feel good as well
3540731 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3540732 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3540733 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3540734 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3540735 you dont have to do it if you are in the middle of something else or if you dont think you want to
3540736 there is actually an answer other than sure of course thats no problem
3540737 i really dont have time would you mind taking care of that for me
3540738 in 1979 dyson began work on a radical design for a vacuum cleaner in the stables behind his house
3540739 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3540740 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3540741 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3540742 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3540743 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3540744 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3540745 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3540746 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3540747 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3540748 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3540749 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3540750 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3540751 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3540752 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3540753 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3540754 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3540755 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3540756 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year
3540757 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee
3540758 everyones body reacts differently i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3540759 i dont know what the doctors are going to tell me about playing golf down the road
3540760 the history of behaviour of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3540761 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3540762 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3540763 a listing of credits on april 28 1960 with a theater review of west side story on its return to the winter garden theater misstated the surname of the actor who played action
3540764 weve only had one to two weeks this summer that weve been able to work a full week on the project because of the rain
3540765 with the financial aid problem it wasnt a software issue so we dont anticipate the same challenges this year
3540766 the biggest problem would probably be the adjustment for the new processing for financial aid but we took many steps to ensure students werent inconvenienced as much as we could
3540767 the good news it that new students will know no difference and each year the students are a little more tech savvy
3540768 on starmu the separate systems did different things so communication between them had to happen overnight now all activity happens immediately so myzou can be accessed 24 7 since all the systems are in one place
3540769 theyve had to learn something new and its been different than completing the pencil and paper bubble sheet
3540770 i love myzou and i havent had any system issues
3540771 the biggest challenge has probably been learning how you look at course enrollments how you see what the capacity is and what the current enrollment is
3540772 some faculty members are finding it easier to handle their responsibilities this year yet some are still finding grades a challenge
3540773 it probably just had to do with my computer but i still cannot get to the web site from my own computer
3540774 i have had the same problem on my laptop myzou doesnt work but from my desktop it does work i thought it was because of everyone signing on for classes but it still doesnt work
3540775 it could not be assumed that all students wanted to e consent
3540776 there was a paper letter sent home in the summer about e consenting then once a student e consented there was a confirmation e mail sent out although due to federal guidelines you cant have both online and paper billing
3540777 they act like agreeing to the e consent is a choice but if you want to have access to online information about financial aid finances or process a loan then you have to agree to e consent
3540778 but the drawback of agreeing to e consent is that your bills are no longer mailed to your permanent address aka your parents and im assuming that much like myself a large percentage of mu students are lucky enough to have their parents pay for their tuition so then it becomes your responsibility
3540779 after three years of my parents paying my bill perfectly and on time my last year of college involved a lot of late payments and a lot of fees
3540780 myzou needs to acknowledge that many parents are involved in the payment of the students bills and should make it easy and simple for the parents to continue paying them
3540781 i am always very aware of anything that comes from mu in the mail billing information especially
3540782 my daughter was abroad in the fall and when she got back we were both very confused as to why we hadnt gotten the regular billing statement that normally comes in the mail
3540783 i take care of her educational finances and now i have to sit on the phone with her while we confusingly walk through the online billing process
3540784 i definitely dont like how you have to change the semester every time you access a new page i also dont like that your actual schedule is mixed in with your dropped classes
3540785 myzous general interface is way complicated there are tons of sections that general students dont need to use and getting to add classes or drop classes can take a bit of searching if youre a first time user
3540786 there are some tools that students have that are slowly getting added so they can see everything advisors can see
3540787 there is good support and were all trying to get used to stuff thats new and allowing kinks to get worked out year two shows a lot of progress
3540788 as far as the to do list goes wed like to see other offices and units learn how that system works and use it more to help with communication
3540789 this new clinic will bring veterans in southwest missouri the quality care they need closer to home
3540790 it is critical that we provide for the patriots who served our nation and clinics like this one will help those veterans in underserved rural areas receive prompt medical care

3540796 the lake cumberland health department in kentuckiana ky has confirmed that taylor county elementary school has a mold mildew and asbestos problem and parents are not happy
3540797 the lake cumberland health department stated that past inspections reveal that the elementary school has had consistent mold and other problems but that the problems have always been addressed in a timely manner parents claim that the school simply paint over the mold and mildew before each new school year
3540798 currently my son has the sniffles the coughs the sort throat

3540805 i actually believe the heart program saved my life and i wouldnt be here without it
3540806 i was scared for the 450 000 people who make up greater waterbury
3540807 had we not had the heart center there is no way she would have survived
3540808 the longer the court delays in enforcing the settlement between the parties the more likely the value of the consideration subject of the settlement i e the value of the stock of each company will change
3540809 this means that the status quo cannot be preserved with a stay
3540810 great vocals let us know if youre interested in our samples
3540811 oh hi thanks this is just a side thing thanks though
3540812 english is one of the easiest languages to learn but the hardest to master
3540813 the short answer about what we do is that were in the business of helping agents answer for their clients
3540814 the suspect attempted to use a stun gun of some type on the victim he hit her with it several times shocked her tried to get her to submit
3540815 screamed very loud kicked at him hit him with a mop handle and eventually he did flee prior to actually committing a sexual assault but it was clear that was his intent
3540816 i have a great niece living with me whos only 17 years old it worries me
3540817 it concerns me a lot she could become a victim
3540818 if that was me i probably wouldnt have been able to do that being stunned and scared like that
3540819 if he got away with it here where else can he get away with it and the scary part is next time he may complete the act
3540820 hes treating and hes frustrated as well but hes got a great great attitude
3540821 from all indications everyone feels great about madieu getting back on the field and being 100 percent soon
3540822 i think i earned a little bit of respect when i was out there friday playing with them and made a few touchdown saving tackles
3540823 thats how you earn the defenses respect just by making plays
3540824 it was just good to see him out there with the lights on
3540825 he had to make a couple of tackles in the back end which is all you care about when it gets to you right there to get him on the ground and he did a good job of doing that
3540826 my guard is still up can it be this easy can my responsibilities be this easy thats the biggest thing just relaxing and playing
3540827 if youre talking you know what youre doing you just call it out
3540828 i could imagine it makes the coaches a little bit more comfortable but it makes me a little bit more comfortable calling it out and making sure everybodys on the same page
3540829 by the end of the year i knew it pretty well
3540830 this is a new year and i can apply that

3540835 as good as this record may be theres a problem all of misanthropy pure sounds exactly the same there are no clean vocals save the occasional half spoken bark no slow mo bass drops no blatant half time low e chug mosh parts to get the x on hand kids moving the riffs are mostly jagged and angular jam packed with spindly guitar lines and offset with the occasional chunky chords
3540836 divert your attention elsewhere and youll find yourself two tracks further into the disc not knowing how the hell you got there
3540837 noen ganger f les det som om hardcore idag bare dreier seg om kverne nostalgisk p gammal storhet at det aldri kommer noe nytt som ikke bare er bra men ogs originalt
3540838 terror er kongene i piten de er brutale entusiastiske og trofaste til d den n r alle bandene rundt dem faller for fristelser kommersielle eller kunstneriske holder terror stand og leverer den mest rensk rne hardcoren du kan finne i 2008 her er alt dill dall og t ys brutalt revet bort og tilbake st r ren pumpende aggresjon og kompromissl st sinne liker du hatebreed last to remain eller first blood m du sjekke ut dette
3540839 i likhet med moshcore h vdingene hatebreed er det en slags kj rlighetserkl ring til alle som befinner seg p utsida av det etablerte samfunnet i kombinasjon med illsinte og muskul se riff som er terrors plattform
3540840 all people should have the freedom to say what they think
3540841 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
3540842 the cma medal of honour recognizes personal contributions to advancing medical research and education
3540843 louise millers dedication to the advancement of medical research health care and health education related to spinal cord injuries is nothing short of inspirational she is a very worthy recipient of this award
3540844 i have never stopped for a second to think that i cant do something i have always thought that i could find a way to get it done
3540845 to promote awareness and create opportunities for people affected by spinal cord injuries to enhance their quality of life
3540846 in recognition of her tireless dedication to the needs of the spinal cord injured her pioneering efforts in the acquisition of the functional electrical stimulation technology and in recognition of her leadership in the origin operation and development of the scitcs organization
3540847 it describes how the human spirit can overcome just about everything no matter how devastating
3540848 i strongly believe that research particularly translational research is the backbone by which people with a spinal cord injury can participate in physical activities to maintain their health while waiting for a cure this has been my focus for the past twenty plus years

3540864 this is a divide that goes deeper than economics into the way people perceive the world if you show an american an image of a fish tank the american will usually describe the biggest fish in the tank and what it is doing if you ask a chinese person to describe a fish tank the chinese will usually describe the context in which the fish swim these sorts of experiments have been done over and over again and the results reveal the same underlying pattern americans usually see individuals chinese and other asians see contexts
3540865 people in collectivist societies tend to underestimate their own skills and are more self effacing when describing their contributions to group efforts
3540866 we are pleased to report our third consecutive profitable quarter since we commenced operations in december 2007 during the second quarter 2008 we acquired two additional vessels bringing our acquisition total to five vessels since we completed the redomiciliation merger out of these five vessels we have already taken delivery of four and expect to take delivery of the fifth vessel in september 2008 also during the second quarter we agreed to sell our oldest vessel star iota which once delivered will lower our average age of our fleet to 8 9 years following the completion of this sale and purchase activity we will have a fleet of twelve vessels with a cargo capacity of over one million in dwt furthermore our strong balance sheet which is approximately 27 of our debt to fleet value provides us with the ability to look for further fleet growth we also declared a dividend of 0 35 per share our third consecutive quarterly dividend since our inception i would like to mention that our time charter coverage protects our dividend payment from any market volatility the dividend represents approximately 57 of our expected 2008 free cash flow and i would also like to mention that we are not a full payout company as having one of the highest dividend yields in the sector we believe it is important to focus on opportunities for further fleet expansion thereby creating long term shareholder value
3540867 no queremos de ninguna manera extinguir el tlcan no somos ilusos ni siquiera el cap tulo agropecuario en su totalidad sino donde no tenemos posibilidades de competir con estados unidos y canad que es en materia de granos espec ficamente ma z y frijol y adem s en leche y carne
3540868 lo nico que falta es la voluntad pol tica del ejecutivo pareciera ser que es el m s reacio que el propio estado unidos llora antes que nos peguen diciendo que si se abre la caja de pandora van a querer revisar otros cap tulos donde m xico ha salido beneficiado
3540869 yo pregunto cu les son otros cap tulos si realmente quitamos la cuesti n de las exportaciones de petr leo si quitamos la cuesti n de la maquila pues realmente no hay sectores exitosos y que no debemos tampoco actuar de manera timorata
3540870 estados unidos s tiene porque para ellos no es un tratado es un acuerdo ustedes sab an eso est debajo de su constituci n est debajo de sus leyes secundarias est debajo de sus leyes estatales ese acuerdo para nosotros est arriba inclusive de las leyes federales y secundarias pero est debajo de nuestra constituci n
3540871 no estamos de acuerdo con los tratados de libre comercio respetamos la posici n del per pero tambi n pedimos que se nos respete pedimos que respeten la normativa andina
3540872 hay varios temas tenemos un proceso de negociaci n con la uni n europea para eso los pa ses andinos tenemos una decisi n en la cual se establece el respeto a la diversidad a los diferentes pa ses
3540873 como parte de una estrategia com n para enfrentar el fracaso de la ronda de doha
3540874 el colapso de las negociaciones de doha le da una oportunidad al mercosur de revalorizar el acuerdo que se negocia desde hace una d cada con la uni n europea
3540875 tan lejos de dios como cerca de los estados unidos

3540880 the major story for kinross in 2008 continues to be the successful development of our three growth projects
3540881 the start up at kupol has gone as planned with strong initial production and excellent grades
3540882 our revenues margins operating earnings and cash flow before working capital have all increased year over year reflecting a strong gold price and solid operating performance
3540883 a key part of our response to industry wide cost pressures is the start up of kinross new growth projects
3540884 the announcement of our friendly offer to acquire aurelian resources demonstrates kinross continued commitment to long term disciplined growth through maintaining a pipeline of high quality development projects and developing them responsibly in close cooperation with the governments and local communities where we operate
3540885 we wish to thank our employees at julietta for their dedicated efforts and contributions our decision to sell our interest in julietta is consistent with our strategy to streamline our portfolio and to focus on core assets in the geographic regions where we operate
3540886 lo vi muy bien con esa fuerza caracter stica de l
3540887 yes with a thought in my head a thought that is stuck there like a fly caught in wet tar
3540888 what do you mean a thought that wont go away
3540889 well you see grandma i saw a help wanted sign it caught my eye made me stare and suddenly a thought flew into my head that i cant imagine me to think of that thought was i might want to help them i mean why would i care i already have enough to do with looking after midnight and making sure all the candles in the house are lit so that it wont be pitch black i also need to get my chores done and buy fresh flowers from wallys flower shop to stop the smell of the rats that live in the wall see what i mean
3540890 well i guess i know what youre getting at but why is that so strange i mean that you thought that
3540891 how if i may ask did you appear out of thin air and zap into our kitchen and who are you
3540892 what a nice girl you have julie how old is she

3540894 i am saying that jasmine is needed at velecitor to help us if you protest then we will turn you into a pig permanently
3540895 i would have zapped you there but if the destination is not on the planet earth we have to fly there
3540896 velecitor isnt on earth if it isnt on earth where is it
3540897 velecitor is on planet amoria the planet that is invisible to a mortals eyes
3540898 shes falling and bawling so bring her up here then the poor soul will be freed of its fear
3540899 jasmine dear when you get to velecitor you will need to learn how to ride a broom without falling off
3540900 well im sorry that i have never ridden a broom before
3540901 falling off of a broom will not get you into miss penderwicks good books id be prepared for her sharp attitude if i were you
3540902 she will shout her guts out if you make the simplest mistake like pronouncing a word in a spell wrong
3540903 ok i guess ill have to get used to it
3540904 well jasmine we have arrived how do you like the looks of velecitor

3540913 poss vel escapar de uma cela usando apenas gua e s dio
3540914 poss vel fazer um ultraleve usando bambus e uma m quina de cortar grama
3540915 oh so you do your own washing dear how very strange
3540916 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3540917 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
3540918 we were trying to produce revenue that would support our expenses and our debt service but also balance that against the realities that tickets were going to be going up for our customers we were going to deliver qualitatively a far far higher product for them
3540919 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3540920 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3540921 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3540922 depends on what it is cause im going to the moon and there is nothing that u can say or do that will keep me here
3540923 i cant tell you but i just i cant kiss you goodbye
3540924 fine then go to the moon i dont care if you ever come back or not you dont care about me anyway
3540925 trying to get rid of me already come on you at least have to hear my singing voice everyone holds on until i try to sing
3540926 dont worry about it after all the other stuff im carrying this will be no hey what do you got in here
3540927 im not trying to be funny what are you trying to smuggle my bathtub in this thing
3540928 it means that im not supposed to hold that book probably no one but you is i can still take your bag if you want but the books all you
3540929 we were planning on doing some traveling at some point right
3540930 so do you miss it home i mean do you miss home
3540931 weve been gone for only a couple of hours its a bit early to start getting homesick isnt it
3540932 no not everywhere town home the place you lived before you came to journeys end
3540933 you dont have to talk about it if you dont want to
3540934 just its okay really one of the things that bothered me the most about what i left behind is that it shouldnt have bothered me i didnt have room to complain worse i always felt that if i did complain or say something i would turn into you know the jock with a soul
3540935 you want to laugh dont you she wanted to laugh but wasnt quite sure why
3540936 no i wont laugh tell me how you became the jock with a soul
3540937 at least i dont think i did lindsey smiled at him
3540938 i think im trying to make it easier on you
3540939 so im not doing a very good job go on
3540940 but it wasnt like i was a jerk or anything i didnt have some alcoholic father who insisted on trying to relive his glory days through me neither and i wasnt that guy who had a ton of girlfriends
3540941 i was still unhappy and i think one of my big problems was that i wasnt happy but i didnt feel like i had a right to complain about it here i am football guy popular guy my life in high school was what you want your life in high school to be like but because i had that i didnt have the right to say hey this isnt so great there were other kids out there who really did have a miserable time in high school and what were my problems compared to theirs
3540942 so i kept doing it i would find myself steering away from certain things i would want to do because after a while it felt like i was just another character in a movie and if i broke from the script the part i had worked so hard for would be taken from me like i like chess my dad taught me how to play when i was a kid but join the chess club no way
3540943 youre inner nerd was just begging to get out wasnt it
3540944 like i said i realize i didnt have it hard
3540945 after a while i began to realize how pointless it all was here i was desperate to maintain my image or whatever and i looked around me and the whole cast was there
3540946 but here everyone likes him because hes a nice guy and likes to help other people out
3540947 i dont know at least i didnt know until you said what you did its better here because people have real purposes instead of just making up stuff that usually isnt very good
3540948 you know i didnt like high school very much either
3540949 i mean look at you half the school was probably your friend and the other half wanted to be
3540950 im sorry i just realized that if this were a movie you and i would
3540951 the discussion we just had comes at the end of the movie right not long after trevor and lindsey decided it would be as good a time as any to stop for the day
3540952 do you want to get ran over by someone not paying attention to where theyre going in the middle of the night
3540953 no i dont think so but you cant be too careful right
3540954 no i just a new spell appeared in my book and i thought id give it a try
3540955 whats the spell lindsey helped him back up onto his feet and was relieved to see he hadnt been harmed in the slightest by her spell
3540956 nothing its all just gibberish really im starved lets eat
3540957 one of the hunters taught me how to make it as he explained it to me when the hunters go out sometimes they dont have the luxury of washing their pots and pans so whatever they cooked the night before becomes part of what theyre cooking now according to him they just got used to the taste of harvest berries and golden deer being cooked together it wasnt until one of them brought the recipe back to everywhere town that it became a big hit
3540958 two bowls i would have thought you were just trying to be nice but three
3540959 now if you know any good ghost stories he chuckled
3540960 sorry im kind of a wimp when it comes to ghost stories
3540961 my dad would take us camping and tell some pretty mean ghost stories lindsey chuckled as she shook her head
3540962 he wasnt very good at it telling ghost stories i mean hed usually forget a part and have to retell it or something stupid like that there were a couple of times where he would end the story and all we could do was laugh because he screwed up so badly
3540963 jeez you guys couldnt cut him a break your family must be vicious
3540964 okay thats it im never telling you anything ever again
3540965 we better get this fire out and get some sleep we got a lot of walking to do tomorrow if we dont drag our feet we might get pretty far into the golden woods
3540966 we need to establish mass manufacturing incentives so we can credibly compete
3540967 lets go to a pool party its in a mansion with rich boys
3540968 am i going to be able to handle whats in store for me
3540969 i was the last guy into this from the pga professional national championship and to be able to bump up to the top and have a chance to be here for the weekend was a good accomplishment
3540970 i hit the approach too hard it must have been a little adrenaline
3540971 i didnt know what the cut mark was until i got into the scoring area and looked on the monitor
3540972 it wouldnt have dictated how i played had i known i thought i played hard and fought hard it was a great experience for me it was nerve wracking at times and you do things that you normally dont do you have to trust yourself will i be upset tonight yeah im italian with some greek mixed in i cant help it
3540973 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3540974 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3540975 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3540976 we started seeing this trend even before some of these escalating issues like the mortgage crisis and gas prices
3540977 but now its kind of exploded with so many people canceling big vacations and staying closer to home
3540978 people are asking themselves is this what i want to do
3540979 wed rather have that three grand in the bank in case something happens with the economy
3540980 we all loaded in the car and went to lincoln park one day
3540981 we brought a football and went to a festival for dinner and the zoo because the zoos free
3540982 were going to rent a popcorn machine and a slushie machine and invite the neighbors over
3540983 people are really getting familiar with their town city or area
3540984 theyre surprised by how much there is to do in their own backyard literally
3540985 were still selling season passes which is unusual this time of year
3540986 with gas prices soaring and airline fees on the rise travelers are looking to save by exploring what their own city has to offer instead of leaving town
3540987 we want to encourage them to do this in an eco friendly fashion using public transportation
3540988 plan out what youre going to do each day just like you would do if you were going to disney
3540989 when you go on vacation you tend to leave those toys behind
3540990 if youre looking at a staycation as family bonding time then you have to leave those things behind
3540991 we are excited to bring the junior pga championship to a venue like tpc rivers bend
3540992 the level of competition will be high and junior ryder cup spots are up for grabs so we are expecting a great championship
3540993 that i spend most of my time and energy trying to acquire what i have determined to be good whether its financial security or health or retirement or whatever and i spend a huge amount of energy and worry fearing what ive determined to be evil
3540994 remember this it allows you to play god in your independence thats why a part of you prefers not to see me and you dont need me at all to create your list of good and evil but you do need me if you have any desire to stop such an insane lust for independence
3540995 you must give up your right to decide what is good and evil on your own terms that is a hard pill to swallow choosing to only live in me to do that you must know me enough to trust me and learn to rest in my inherent goodness
3540996 our concern comes in now to finding her safely so we can get her to a hospital
3540997 she has a huge family here i pleaded with the med she needed some type of mental help assisted living not a place to live i dont know how the homeless shelter came into play
3540998 the question i wanted to know was can she take care of herself because we are a homeless shelter independent living they said yes she is fine
3540999 at this point i dont care whos to blame we just want some help
3541000 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3541001 the pga championship continues to elevate its reach to new audiences with perennially the strongest field in golf and the deepest international field of any u s major
3541002 we are very pleased to begin a long term agreement with tsn canada that will enhance all our major spectator championships and prepare for our centennial in 2016
3541003 is the perfect complement for the outstanding coverage that we have enjoyed over the years through cbs and turner which continues a tradition of delivering the great moments and superb performances of the worlds finest players
3541004 we have more business booked now for this months pga fall expo than we almost have time to accommodate
3541005 we expect a busy two days with current customers and look forward to establishing new accounts as well
3541006 the pga fall expo traditionally has been very busy for tour edge
3541007 this year we are scheduling more advance appointments than ever before and expect a good deal of business to support our fall 2008 product launch
3541008 with the little hiccup in the economy this year the difference between those golf facilities succeeding and those that arent comes down to being able to exceed customers expectations
3541009 the pga fall expo offers a unique opportunity to look at new products that create retail excitement to study in seminars that teach new methods of attracting customers and networking opportunities that share incredible insights on whats working around the industry to having customers return again and again theres absolutely no alternative nearly as effective as this show and its sister the pga merchandise show to bettering your business
3541010 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3541011 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3541012 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this
3541013 presley place where the money will go we contribute to them every year
3541014 also i want that on display in my living room in a curio cabinet
3541015 it was a fabulous week a great presentation and a great setting and i couldnt believe how many pga professionals were there
3541016 jim has been a great help and im feeling that i can really drive the ball well now
3541017 i was hitting the ball long when i didnt have the prosthesis
3541018 but im getting better adjusted now jim has been great to work with
3541019 to be honest i had underestimated the difficulty of oakland hills
3541020 i didnt think the fairways would be that tight and it was almost a u s open for me i was very honored to have had ben and david following me around for 18 holes they were in pain walking but that was very special to me to see that support
3541021 i may have a bad day on the golf course but there are a lot of guys like ben and david where it would be one of their greatest days to be out on the golf course
3541022 my goal is to keep helping these guys and the many more veterans who want to find enjoyment through golf my wife said once to me that playing full time on the tour wasnt in the cards and now you have found a new mission in life i believe that i have been able to help carry on a greater mission
3541023 you struggle to find ways to get people to play better golf
3541024 the veterans we see have many of the physical attributes needed to play golf before they arrive they have balance mobility good hand eye coordination and can think under pressure above all they are not afraid to fail you hear how discipline breeds in the military that transfers over when you are teaching them
3541025 there are many things that my dad and i have discussed to help in instruction
3541026 it is so rewarding for me to see golf play a vital role in their recovery overall i think that this has been the best year of my pga life
3541027 when you can do things for other people it comes back we hope that the work we have been doing with the veterans will be replicated around the country there are no limits to what golf can do when it comes to making these men and women find value in their lives
3541028 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny

3541237 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3541238 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3541239 beneath photography grew from a side project created by young rising photographer andrew ferguson after being involved in a graphic design course at hull school of art and design andrew got his hands on his first slr camera and set his sights on the world of photography in the hopes of mastering the techniques of his boy hood idols needless to say andrew could not have imagined the level of un edited talent that was seemingly harboring inside of him waiting for a chance to break out

3541345 georgia does not stop its treacherous actions on abkhazias border and continues to intensify its military presence the armed forces of the republic were forced to enter the security zone and advance towards the georgian border
3541346 georgia has a 2 000 strong contingent supporting the u s led coalition in iraq and washington provides training and equipment to the georgian military
3541347 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
3541348 were already here in the store we already know how to do everything why dont we go ahead and work
3541349 the u s military instructors directly command and coordinate actions of mercenaries without being involved in actual fighting the source specified according to intelligence data there are roughly 1 000 military instructors of the united states in georgia
3541350 task force of russia has annihilated a few groups of mercenaries some of mercenaries have been captured and investigators are working with them the source said
3541351 we have detained 10 agents of the georgian special services who were spying on military facilities and preparing terrorist attacks including on russian territory
3541352 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3541353 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3541354 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3541355 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3541356 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
3541357 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
3541358 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
3541359 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
3541360 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3541361 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3541362 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals

3541376 small businesses that are going to be liable for a lot of income tax are likely to use other tax forms so they only pay individual income taxes
3541377 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes
3541378 the u s corporate tax rate stayed the same while foreign countries have drifted down which increases the incentive for companies to report income in other countries
3541379 if the u s drops the rate to 30 but closes other tax loopholes that may ultimately generate more tax revenue for the government

3541395 ah ka chan i forgot to tell you yesterday some of these are live plants uh ayumin said you were into gardening before
3541396 oh before we had a garden my sisters and i we had one with ka san back home
3541397 yeah thats what ayumin said well i figured you might want some plants in the house

3541400 i am happy im happy because im me and youre you and im with you and i love you
3541401 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment

3541405 not so long ago it seems we all knew a great uncle harold or aunty irene but sadly it seems these names could soon be lost forever
3541406 it is clear that modern parents are increasingly being influenced by fashions and celebrity however we also need to remember that there are now more choices available
3541407 the columbia river represents a renewable resource that has the potential to keep taxes low and give our children a world class education
3541408 every day millions of gallons of water pour into the ocean that could be sold to other states that desperately need our abundant water supply the state revenue generated from utilizing this wasted resource could be used to lower oregons class sizes improve pay for teachers and create more opportunity at oregons community colleges and universities
3541409 selling this water will allow us to raise money to educate our kids
3541410 smith is the last republican standing in a state where democrats now occupy every other statewide office majorities in the state legislature and four out of five congressional seats oregon after all hasnt voted for a republican presidential candidate since ronald reagan and has had a democratic governor since 1986 all that said there is a reason why smith is still standing today and the democratic primary in this race allowed smith to capture the center
3541411 i would sincerely hope that the italian parliament would pass this law
3541412 we athletes go through major sacrifices to get to this level it would be the right thing to do to remove the taxes from what we get here it would be a very good thing

3541446 we had hoped that the secretary of states elections division would recognize their mistake correct it and allow us to move on
3541447 the opinion of our legal advisors is that the states actions are inconsistent with oregon law and we need the court to step in and make a determination
3541448 there appears to be a difference of opinion in the interpretation of the law and the independent party is asking the courts to clearly define the law
3541449 the independent party makes a strong argument that the statutory changes in 1995 require that party nominations accepted by a candidate should appear on that candidates ballot line
3541450 the statute seems to indicate that both nominations should be printed in this case

3541453 that love is reverence and worship and glory and the upward glance not a bandage for dirty sores but they dont know it those who s peak of love most promiscuously are the ones whove never felt it they make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy compassion contempt and general indifference and they call it love once youve felt what it means to love as you and i know it the total passion for the total height you are unable of anything else

3541461 they do feel they have a right to saturate and question everyone who happens to be in an area but that is the unconstitutional nature of it
3541462 the fact they think they can stop everyone for no reason
3541463 these residents giving up their right to travel giving up their 4th amendment rights its not making them safer
3541464 i understand her view and i appreciate it but its academic it works in the law schools of the world but out here on the ground what were doing is perfectly legal nobodys constitutional rights are being violated

3541472 they will judge us not by what we say but by what we do
3541473 the production of bamboo would fall under our perennial crop standards so in theory we could certify the crop but the problem is the processing the process needed to break down the bamboo to make the fibres is very similar to that used to make viscose and weve yet to see a method that would come anywhere close to complying with our production standards people always say bamboo is great because it grows so quickly but so does cotton
3541474 wed be happy to certify bamboo at the soil association if someone could come up with a sustainable method that goes all through the supply chain not just the growing

3541476 its a great opera a work of serious genius the father son relationship is rich and powerful but you have to do all the recitatives
3541477 there were too many bmws in the car park and i can say that because i drive one myself i had originally intended the company to become site specific but never managed it because touring used to be the big god if you toured you got funding but in order to tour you have to have a product to sell that wasnt what i wanted
3541478 the appeal was listened to and we got the funding back so all fairness to the arts council for that
3541479 i dont want to create an opera company in that sense
3541480 it offers a conduit which is the opposite of what you get across an orchestra pit with an all white cast and chorus
3541481 yes with great care i consciously set out more or less to match the demographic of the city
3541482 is that to do it well costs a lot of money
3541483 without subsidy it wont exist anyone in this show will tell you what opera can do for them that nothing else can its a luxury but so are most things these events become very important to these peoples lives they buy the cds they listen they go to see other shows
3541484 i can do nothing it doesnt depend on what i do any more i dont think critics read my books
3541485 but i always go to the locations when i write a novel in this case some of the locations were so impressive that the idea for the film came from that
3541486 i enjoyed the preparation of the movie i mean the period immediately before the shooting when you choose everything all the details when you create the world i enjoyed a lot of the shooting too
3541487 bauchau has something in him that is to do with sincere spirituality
3541488 he gives the impression of someone who believes in something that is honest

3541490 i tried but they are extremely boring i dont understand their success
3541491 the actors are good but that in my opinion was the only good thing technically it is not very good the script is not good
3541492 it is disgusting i dont like people talking about my private life

3541497 mugabe wanted tsvangirai as a ceremonial prime minister there was never any serious intent by mugabe to give up power
3541498 there is no future for these talks unless the facilitator mbeki is able to come forward with proposals that demonstrate a change in mugabes position
3541499 the pressure only went one way on tsvangirai and he had no proposals to break the logjam

3541511 i dont want to push these guys to play and then tomorrow he comes in and says he cant play
3541512 i want to make sure that when they walk through the door in their mind they are ready to play rather than trying to come in and find out if they can play
3541513 its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
3541514 i didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy

3541519 as far as i know life of brian is still banned from being shown at the cinema
3541520 i didnt even know the ban was in existence until friday
3541521 it is intriguing to think it is banned but i suppose these things come into place and unless they are revoked the ban remains
3541522 maybe you can still get prosecuted for showing it i think it has been shown in the town before but it was shown quietly
3541523 we are talking 30 years ago now and things have moved on rapidly in terms of censorship
3541524 then it was to do with the religious controversy rather than the nudity but you could say in respect of the religious side that it has become more controversial with it being so much to the fore
3541525 i think anything should be strong enough to take this sort of probing that is my opinion and it is not shared with everybody
3541526 i dont think it would harm the religious faith im going to talk to my town clerk jim griffiths and we will be investigating
3541527 it was quite an experience we were out filming in tunisia for two and a half months and we had to adjust to a different heat and a different culture
3541528 it was quite chaotic the financial situation was quite dodgy for them although i wasnt aware of that
3541529 it was what is the word fluid everybody pitched in and it was great fun
3541530 it was wonderful to have been part of it and it has stayed with me ever since people remember that when they forget everything else
3541531 what is toleration it is the natural attribute of humanity we are all formed of weakness and error let us pardon reciprocally each others folly that is the first law of nature
3541532 we wanted to cheer her up and there arent many things you can give to someone who is ill
3541533 i thought it was taking away something very important from someone who wasnt very well if i was on a ward id like to receive cards
3541534 we had never heard of this before and can only assume it is due to any bugs in the flowers or vases being knocked over
3541535 we asked if they could be left in a dayroom or nurses quarters but this was also rejected and they wouldnt dispose of them so the alternative was to bin them or bring them home
3541536 frenchay is a wonderful hospital but it seems a shame people cant receive cards or flowers they could maybe put the cards and flowers in an area away from the beds
3541537 many older people find get well cards to be a reassuring and pleasant distraction from illness while in hospital
3541538 while we fully understand the paramount importance of keeping hospital wards clean and tidy we cant help wondering whether this isnt a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut we would hope that with a bit of flexible thinking it would be possible to allow older people to recover with appropriate support from family and friends
3541539 we dont prevent patients displaying get well cards on the wards
3541540 however maintaining a clean environment and reducing infection is this trusts number one priority
3541541 it is particularly important that the area around the patients bed is kept as clean as possible and is free of clutter so our cleaners can get complete access
3541542 responsibility for cleanliness lies with the sister in charge on each ward and if they feel cards on display by a patients bedside are getting in the way of domestic staff they will ask them to be taken down
3541543 we hope this particular patient and their family understand the very good reasons why they were asked to do this
3541544 but converting a vehicle that gets 55 mpg vs gms chevy avalanche which gets something like 15 mpg makes much more sense
3541545 as the cost of living is on the up these figures even if they are only part reflective of pensioners as a whole are of real concern
3541546 retirement should be a time to enjoy yourself after all those years of hard work
3541547 the cost of living for the elderly has surpassed inflation over the past decade therefore it is more important than ever that consumers are aware of the dangers of approaching retirement with such large amounts of debt
3541548 for many pensioners today these figures show its a case of bought then worrying about it now
3541549 with the costs of living increasing dramatically particularly as winter approaches and fuel costs mount up it is vital that those struggling are given the help they need to ensure that people arent trapped by debt
3541550 while the details of the incidents are still emerging we want to make it clear that unity takes this matter very seriously
3541551 i have known the glazer family for 50 years and they are people with the utmost integrity and who have a great passion for the business the strategic joint venture of our two leading organizations each with a great history will create the most capable and effective u s distributor network in the business fortified by the combined efforts of the team members of both our companies

3541556 with the establishment of southern glazers distributors of america our two companies will create an historic management and operations services venture this new strategic joint venture will draw upon the experience and expertise of two of the countrys leading distributors southern glazers distributors of america will have increased capabilities to better serve suppliers and customers and will be well positioned for future success both companies have exceptional teams of talented and experienced associates we are both extremely excited to work with melvin a dick who will serve as senior vice president of the new venture
3541557 i look forward to working hand in hand with the glazer team to help create the greatest wine and spirits distribution company in the united states
3541558 i am thrilled to work alongside mike maxwell who will serve with me as executive vice president and chief operating officer operations and plan on bringing the national scope of our two organizations together we both realize that the key will be local execution for our supplier partners and that part of the organization will be benefited by the focus of bringing the best elements of both companies together this strategic joint venture will create an organization capable of delivering the highest standards of sales operations and service excellence in the industry to each and every critical sales channel we are dedicated to serving on behalf of all our supplier partners we will know we are successful when this transition is seamless to our customer base
3541559 the national synergies and economies of scale of our new company will allow us to better compete in the highly competitive and ever changing industry landscape in the united states brad and i will lead a dedicated team that will include lee f hager and cary rossel the two new co executive vice presidents and chief administrative and accounting officers of the strategic joint venture that will oversee the integration of the two organizations
3541560 the reality of creating the strongest leadership team behind wayne and jerry and brad and mike will give us the ability to execute for our supplier partners and realize the potential that exists for our brands and our strategic joint venture this new strategic relationship will be backed by a powerful association of two exceptionally successful companies coming together to create the foremost distributor in america one that will help us compete more effectively and provide better stability for our employees and suppliers for the future

3541570 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
3541571 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
3541572 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
3541573 i have weird ideas like what if jack nicholson played mike brady ithinkitmightgoalittlesomethinglikethis

3541576 she was examined for abdominal pain related to gunshot wounds
3541577 when i learn something new and it happens every day i feel a little more at home in this universe a little more comfortable in the nest
3541578 thats where nursing staff took these babies and left them to die
3541579 christ hospital and we now know other hospitals and clinics around the country are involved in an abortion procedure called induced labor abortion
3541580 my experience was that they the babies survive as short as a few minutes to once almost as long as an eight hour shift
3541581 to be clear these were living babies who were left out to die and they were issued both birth and death certificates according to illinois state law
3541582 when she told me what she was doing i couldnt bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone
3541583 and so i cradled and rocked him for the forty five minutes that he lived
3541584 was unmoved and actually opposed the born alive infant protection act
3541585 thought that infanticide was acceptable and voted to protect it some people said that barack obama was uninformed or may not have fully understood the implications of this bill but he voted against it three times thats calculated
3541586 as chairman of the health and human services committee in 2003 he stopped the identical wording from being introduced
3541587 a film is a very specific and personal account of
3541588 saw no reason now or in the future why anyone would want to legalize abortion in kenya
3541589 affront to humanity of everybody and especially to the integrity of the human being
3541590 that a country is going mad if it starts killing its youth because in children the country has the seed for its future he said that if any government including president kibakis government were to enact such a law they would be acting against the people of kenya
3541591 slaves of foreign ideologies and policies that are devoid of christianity
3541592 i personally feel the continued denial of women to make free choice on their reproductive health life is wrong and the policy should be reformed to allow that freedom
3541593 families who are on budgets or fixed incomes are i mean its just unbelieveable
3541594 my husband and i will make it in the end but theres a lot of families who wont
3541595 the biggest point is to start now because there are some measures that you can take right now
3541596 we get quite a few calls every day from people even though their furnace works theyre looking for a higher efficiency unit
3541597 well just have to cut a lot of that out and really stick to the essentials in terms of what we need instead of what we want
3541598 looking at all the pictures the baby pictures he just had such a short life
3541599 i remember talking to him staying up late just talking chatting
3541600 we still have great hope that hell be around and well find him
3541601 we accept you the way you are but we want you to be like us
3541602 the thief on the cross went to paradise and the woman caught in adultery was pardoned and protected but you need to worship like we do dress like we do and change your ways
3541603 why cant we do something to keep our children in the church
3541604 philo is thats why i have to talk to him now ok
3541605 do you see it philo it all opens outward do you see
3541606 you have to really look but if you do you can see it can you see it

3541610 tentu saja kami menyesal tidak berada di sana dan hanya menyaksikan lewat televisi tapi itulah takdir kami

3541616 pay me big stacks of money to tell them how to do this show because i know everything and people on the internet think im smart
3541617 bishop cardoni in his votum on infallibility at vatican i made the point that the pope is seriously obliged under pain of sin to take the necessary means to ascertain that his dogmatic definition in fact conforms with the christian revelation the inseparability of the definition from the process raises questions as to whether we are here confronted in effect with a new condition of infallibility what if it were evident that in a given case the pope did not have access to certain essential data or did not take the requisite measures to ascertain what was in scripture or tradition are we to assume that a miracle would supply for the diligence lacking to the pope
3541618 in response to questions such as these many appeal to divine providence as assuring that the pope will not abuse his powers as supreme teacher in cases involving infallibility although accepted by many theologians from joseph leutgen to karl rahner this argument from divine providence has some weaknesses in general it is hazardous to appeal to what god in his providence would or would not permit he has permitted doubts and disagreements to persist for some time about who is the true pope and this would seem to be an evil at least as great as a particular error in papal teaching
3541619 further the argument appears to assume too hastily that an erroneous papal teaching under the claim of infallibility would destroy the faith of the universal church why could not the faithful find ways of recognizing the error through theological criticism being brought to bear on the pronouncement through the unfavorable reaction of the bishops and other pastors and through the inward teaching of the holy spirit which according to vatican ii gives a certain inerrancy to the faith of the entire people of god lumen gentum 12
3541620 perhaps in our day thanks to a greater appreciation of the many ways in which the spirit instructs the church we should recognize that adequate investigation of the sources of revelation is a true condition for an infallible teaching
3541621 again vatican i did not rule out the view of most theologians since the middle ages that it is possible for a pope to fall into heresy or schism if he did so he would presumably be incapable of validly exercising his office since heresy and schism if externally manifested automatically excommunicate from the church thus any alleged definitions issued by a schismatical or heretical pope would be invalid but it is not always easy to determine what deviations amount to heresy or schism hence in some cases it could be doubtful whether the pope were validly defining
3541622 in view of the transcendence of the content of faith one may properly hesitate to employ expressions such as revealed doctrines although such expressions appear in some church documents e g ds 3803 defining the immaculate conception it must be recognized that the categories used in ecclesiastical definitions are human and that the definitions therefore fall short of adequately expressing the content of revelation itself dogmas must be seen as human formulations of the word of god formulations not undialectically identified with the revelation they transmit thus it is possible that one and the same faith may be expressed in formulas that stand in tension with one another and indeed that seem contradictorily opposed
3541623 did vatican i assume too rapidly that the faithful were abjectly dependent for the content of their faith on the authoritative teaching of the pope so that if he erred they would all be led inevitably into the same errors do we today count more as suggested above on the many ways in which the holy spirit teaches the faithful and on their capacity thanks to these resources to detect the errors even of a pope if so can we not admit more conditions to infallible teaching than were explicitly recognized by vatican i
3541624 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i
3541625 we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in
3541626 were not saying this is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
3541627 its not looking promising with beyonce but we may end up with someone like fellow destinys child singer kelly rowland appearing at the opera house
3541628 were seeing people bringing their own bags from home but a lot of people have also invested in our jute bags and we will be looking at extending this range
3541629 the feedback weve had from customers has been incredibly positive and such a dramatic drop in demand for plastic bags will help the national trust cut its waste and reduce the amount of rubbish ending up in landfill sites
3541630 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3541631 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3541632 divorce rates were certainly lower before and up to the mid 60s when pill use became commonplace but as you can imagine there are plenty of alternative explanations for increasing divorce rates since then a definitive study has yet to be done im seeking funding for this
3541633 women were more likely to report having had affairs and reported lower sexual satisfaction with their current partner
3541634 do not let your hearts be troubled trust in god trust also in me 2 in my fathers house are many rooms if it were not so i would have told you i am going there to prepare a place for you 3 and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where i am 4 you know the way to the place where i am going
3541635 lord we dont know where you are going so how can we know the way
3541636 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
3541637 get your eternal cockpit checklist out blow the dust off it and get busy before its too late the clock is ticking enjoy your flight hope you will arrive safely and join me in the crew lounge one day
3541638 usually we talk about coverages and compare notes from play to play if branden is on the field on a play i will look at his technique and then we talk about it when he comes off the field he does the same for me when we are both on the sideline we look at what the freshmen are doing and then help out any way we can after the drill
3541639 he spoke to us about being physical and about how he worked against a defensive back while running routes
3541640 he said how it was not abnormal to have a bad day at practice but when you do to lean on your support system like your family your teammates and your friends he told us to be the best in every aspect of the game from practice to studying film he says that it will pay off and he is a great example of how continuing to do those little things and working hard pays off
3541641 ele j mostrou isto no cruzeiro j mostrou que n o sente o peso da camisa eu acho que com esta oportunidade que vai ser dada para ele ele vai conseguir apresentar um excelente futebol
3541642 n o s eu mas como todo mundo aqui no cruzeiro a gente vai torcer para ele para que ele ajude a sele o a vencer e se firme como titular
3541643 john kerry won the major cities and metropolitan areas in our state more than he had hoped to win by i mean he did exceedingly well and he lost the election because of his lack of support in small town and rural ohio
3541644 that every part of this state is being targeted means that sen obama will not repeat the kerry mistake
3541645 john mccain knows how important ohio is in this election which is why he will continue traveling throughout the state to discuss his plans to create jobs and provide relief at the pump
3541646 likewise the mccain campaign will do what it can in the big cities
3541647 those are areas where democrats have not done very well ted strickland is an exception whether sen obama can do that in a presidential election remains to be seen rural and small town areas tend to be more conservative and sen obama is seen as very liberal
3541648 is sen obama going to win every county and every region probably not
3541649 but in some heavily republican counties we can go from 29 to perhaps 38 and in some counties we can go from 38 to 44 so im confident that the strategy here is going to be effective its an attempt to reach every voter in every part of ohio
3541650 this is not a list that ranks who can play the fastest or with the most taste feeling or technique although many players on our list have all of those arrows in their quiver
3541651 it is rather a tribute to the great men who shit iron and piss stainless steel razor blades and do it every time they plug into an amplifier
3541652 n o tem nada disso todo dia tem uma especula o j venderam o f bio o ramires o wagner o guilherme e outros jogadores que est o em destaque claro que existe a possibilidade de um jogador sair mas n o tem nada nesse momento

3541766 we are also one of only two nations in human history to make happiness an explicit core of our national agenda as economist arthur c brooks points out in his new book
3541767 it took 194 years for the only other nation ever to prioritize happiness as a goal the tiny buddhist monarchical dictatorship of bhutan
3541768 but what makes people happy mr brooks a professor at syracuse university chews through the data twin studies suggest about half of our baseline happiness is genetic that leaves us with a glass half full of things people can do or believe that will make them feel better about their lives
3541769 of course conservatives are more likely to be religious and to be married both important contributors to happiness
3541770 but even if you correct for difference of religion marriage income age education and race the conservative is 10 percentage points more likely than the liberal to report being very happy
3541771 two things and this is my reading of mr brooks data make people happy freedom and community people are happier when they feel their actions and choices matter to themselves and to other people
3541772 conservatives are more likely to feel connected to projects larger than themselves such as god family religion and morality

3541782 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3541783 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3541784 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3541785 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3541787 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3541788 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3541789 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3541790 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3541791 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3541792 no coal no nukes we wont stop until you do
3541793 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3541794 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3541878 there is a very strong feeling that a danger to a jewish community should never be ignored again
3541879 as far as im concerned they are jews they are as much jews as any other jew from ethiopia or new york
3541880 qantas discovered an irregularity with paperwork for these aircraft during an internal integrity check of maintenance records
3541881 in line with our prudent response to any maintenance issue however minor we have elected to suspend the operation of the six aircraft while we ensure all our records are 100 accurate and we have advised the civil aviation safety authority casa
3541882 my first day with travel counsellors is one ill never forget i was at head office in melbourne for my induction and i already had bookings i didnt think much of it until i saw my name up in lights on the tc intranet not only was i the leader for australia but for the rest of the world and this was my first day i cant tell you what a buzz that was to see the travel counsellor system at work and my name at position one awesome
3541883 we are definitely on track as far as recruitment numbers are concerned
3541884 the agents that have joined travel counsellors are generating a fantastic mix of business of a very high quality our focus is to completely support these travel professionals to do what they do best sell travel
3541885 we have to maximise our earnings during this difficult period which is why are moving our capacity
3541886 however while we are reducing services on some routes we will continue to maintain the integrity of our network reshaping it where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover costs and also make money
3541887 do you think your salary including commissions and bonuses adequately reflects your skills
3541888 sharon osbourne ozzys wife spent his money the chanel store on robertson
3541889 there is a clear medical need for therapies that prolong graft function in kidney transplant patients and that more broadly inhibit fibrosis in other clinical settings
3541890 we have made rapid progress on stx 100 since obtaining the program from biogen idec last year this action by the fda should facilitate the development of this drug for transplant patients
3541891 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing edumnd burke
3541892 it was a dream come true just to race here
3541893 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
3541894 if certain tests had come back elevated my parents would have stepped in
3541895 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3541896 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3541897 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3541898 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3541899 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3541900 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3541901 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3541902 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone
3541903 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3541904 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3541905 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3541906 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3541907 i feel it would have been more than distasteful for me
3541908 im christian and i dont want to subject myself to such things
3541909 every day for the past month weve been hit up by people wanting explanations statements clarifications and declarations about mf doom
3541910 overdag is ze huisarts in amsterdam en neemt in gooi en vechtstreek zon twaalf tot vijftien diensten per maand over van andere huisartsen
3541911 er zijn huisartsen die de nacht en de zaterdag niet meer willen doen voor zon dienst kan ik gemiddeld 65 euro bruto per uur vragen s nachts meer zon 70 euro bruto per uur ik leef er wel bij in vakantietijd en met kerst kun je meer vragen meestal wel zon 80 euro bruto per uur

3541916 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3541917 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3541918 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3541919 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3541920 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3541921 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3541922 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3541923 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3541924 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3541925 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3541926 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3541927 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3541928 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3541929 for most women going part time means accepting the obvious trade offs they often make less money lose benefits and risk putting their career off track but there are women who avoid the pitfalls and manage to have it all
3541930 most are in new york and the east coast seattle san francisco i dont have any in albuquerque
3541931 obese adults and those with adult onset type 2 diabetes mellitus may already have lower levels of cognitive function in childhood consistent with a subtle developmental impairment
3541932 this study cannot identify the specific biological processes linking poorer physical control and co ordination in childhood with later obesity however it suggests that some of the processes associated with poorer neurological function in obese adults have their origins in childhood
3541933 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3541934 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3541935 i really dont know why michelle continues to do this
3541936 we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men we all have different agendas in life
3541937 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on the being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
3541938 the comments i havent them or read them i dont really care actually
3541939 people will have their opinion about me and obviously a couple of various criticisms or compliments will come my way and i may hear about them or i may accidentally read about them but id rather them have opinions about me than not have opinions about me so thats just the way it is
3541940 i dont listen to them i listen to the people that are close to me and i respect
3541941 but in the end everything comes down to my decision
3541942 michelle is a very talented young athlete that has unbelievable potential
3541943 its unfortunate the way things have gone for michelle in the last little while but michelle is a talent we need that talent on our tour she brings a lot of people out to watch her
3541944 you know i hope for michelle that she can continue being a kid at stanford and ill be selfish to say a good and important part of our tour
3541945 the year was inconsistent ive kind of had my ups and downs but i feel my game has gotten better over the summer
3541946 i feel as though ive and i dont know really how to say it but ive just kind of learned how to be patient with myself and how to just try and accept things and try not to be as perfect and just enjoy the game again
3541947 right now im too involved with me playing this summer to be thinking about the future
3541948 we will never forget what happened to our angel but today is more about celebrating katelynn remembering her
3541949 i loved you yesterday i love you today and i will love you forever
3541950 what our friend fails to realize is how god works
3541951 god weeps jesus weeps for katelynn you cannot understand the pain her passing has caused
3541952 this just shows what kind of community we have here
3541953 the grieving will never stop for some but the support we are showing is tremendous
3541954 i think these are good principles to settle the problem to end this dramatic situation
3541955 traditionally we will see a few skirmishes but frontal attacks and positioning will end
3541956 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3541957 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3541958 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3541959 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3541960 foreign minister bernard kouchner of france briefed us on the ongoing discussions between the french and the russians as well as the french and the georgians i believe that they believe they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation it is very important now that all parties cease fire the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will
3541961 the ceasefire was clearly not considered enough it is very important that all parties go back to what is called the status quo as it existed on the august 6 so it is not only a ceasefire a cessation of hostilities the situation of the august 6 has to be restored and that also means that all forces have to be in the positions they had on that date
3541962 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its
3541963 let your spirit come upon these gifts to make them holy
3541964 make holy therefore these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like the dewfall
3541965 christ has died christ is risen christ will come again
3541966 i met craig at the indoor karting centre in falkirk and i just started off giving him a few tips and then a bit of a hand and then a bit more help
3541967 hes definitely keen and well just keep plugging away and seeing how far we can take it
3541968 it only took 4 million to get lewis hamilton from the go kart circuit to where he is now so who knows

3541981 other than the fact that you dont have 92 telling you exactly what is coming and what to expect there really isnt much difference this year
3541982 it isnt like its a new position for me im a starter now thats it
3541983 im just going to build on what we established last year and continue getting better
3541984 maybe i am baiting some offensive coordinators not to double team me right now
3541985 honestly i am the new guy on the block but i feel i am going to go out there and give whoever tries to block me a long night
3541986 we have everything in already that we are going to throw at people
3541987 its a lot of the same things but we have more twists to them it will be a little more complex but we are ready for that now we can make a lot of the calls he is making
3541988 we were angry that detroit scored on the first drive and i like that
3541989 its neither reasonable nor feasible to suggest the hospital could provide land
3541990 i think it would be a mistake to conclude that a large percentage of future employees would all want to live in palo alto
3541991 we see this as a dialogue between the hospitals and the city
3541992 we continue to believe and really urge others that this dialogue needs to be about health care and hospitals
3541993 we dont have beds for people in our hospital we dont want people to lose sight of that
3541994 why would that requirement be applied to the hospital when its never been applied to any other business in palo alto thats creating jobs
3541995 these homes are not fit for anyone to live in
3541996 in the brush in the middle of nowhere on a dead end road
3541997 weve known for a while they were a little strange that they didnt want interference from the outside world but unless were down there on a call its not part of our routine patrol
3541998 if we dont make it this year im not going to explode
3541999 injuries are a part of the game and in 35 years since weve owned the yankees ive never seen a rash of injuries like this
3542000 considering the injuries and what hes done with the bullpen without joba it speaks volumes to what hes capable of doing and how smart he is at some point theres nothing you can do
3542001 chamberlain had become the most dominant starting pitcher in baseball and wang has been a 19 game winner every year
3542002 you lose those two guys its rough if the red sox lost josh beckett and jon lester the whole national media would be crying about it we lose two guys better than beckett and lester and you dont hear anything
3542003 its not making excuses its reality thats part of the game thats clearly our problem
3542004 were going to win it next year if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous
3542005 i know we have had a lot of injuries to deal with said girardi who lost jorge posada and hideki matsui for extended time
3542006 no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team
3542007 imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester pitching is 70 percent of the game wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3542008 joe girardi has done a fantastic job unfortunately we havent gotten to where we need to be a lot of it has to do with health and a lot of it has to do with performance cashman said
3542009 you cant think there is you have to have an urgency cashman said
3542010 i know our guys understand that i hear terms like flat but thats what you look like when you are playing like we are now our guys care but they arent producing
3542011 for kenny phillips to fall to us like the way he did it was like an early christmas present
3542012 he said coach man im going to be honest with you i hate seeing guys like kenny back there in the middle of the post because theyre so fast and so rangy it is very intimidating to see him back there especially because he can get from the middle of the field to the sidelines
3542013 that right there coming from a guy like plaxico means a lot
3542014 i havent told that to kenny yet but im sure you guys will print that now im expecting great things out of this young man
3542015 tynes jammed his foot the other day when he was kicking
3542016 he slipped on his plant foot and came down in an awkward way
3542017 a day or two ago he told me that he thought today would be the day but i dont know its very frustrating it is for the player too i mean hes here for a reason and he had such great expectations unfortunately the way it works in this game he had his best practice and then thats the last time i saw him
3542018 reynolds that one is tough for me to talk about
3542019 he had like 18 plays and now he is out not good
3542020 the west palm beach police department has a zero tolerance policy for use of excessive force
3542021 following an internal investigation which the department launched itself without a complaint from the robbery suspect chief delsa bush substantiated that the incident on may 26th 2008 was a violation of policy and the involved officers have all either resigned or have been served with notices of termination as of this date
3542022 i consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever
3542023 aneess only advantage is that he is the brother of dawood beyond that his contribution to the growth of d gang is not much it is people like shakeel whose sweat and toil made the gang what it is today
3542024 diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggy whilst looking for a really big stick
3542025 the pga championship continues to elevate its reach to new audiences with perennially the strongest field in golf and the deepest international field of any u s major
3542026 we are very pleased to begin a long term agreement with tsn canada that will enhance all our major spectator championships and prepare for our centennial in 2016
3542027 is the perfect complement for the outstanding coverage that we have enjoyed over the years through cbs and turner which continues a tradition of delivering the great moments and superb performances of the worlds finest players
3542028 history has shown time and time again that if you leave violence to go unchecked it leads to more problems
3542029 whatever actions are taken will be at the international level and not bilateral
3542030 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3542031 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team
3542032 imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester pitching is 70 percent of the game wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3542033 its not making excuses its reality thats part of the game thats clearly our problem
3542034 it the impeachment leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pak afghan border but clearly our side of the border too like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
3542035 isi is behind it according to whatever information we have we would expect that the political leadership of pakistan would take some action against it either against rogue elements in it or an isi operating without control
3542036 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
3542037 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
3542038 i think the attraction is the unique combination of scenery the white bluffs and the wildlife and that odd collection of nuclear sites
3542039 i would like to see the b reactor preserved because i would like that story to be told
3542040 ante las presiones inflacionarias los gobiernos tienen dos formas de atacarlas por la v a de la pol tica fiscal que es b sicamente la reducci n del gasto o por la v a monetaria que es b sicamente la elevaci n de los tipos de inter s eso significa en el corto plazo un sacrificio del crecimiento pero es muy importante mantener los equilibrios macroecon micos en el tiempo porque eso es lo que asegura el crecimiento y estoy seguro que en colombia se va a encontrar eso
3542041 la informaci n que tenemos es que hay un plan para desestabilizar la ciudad no se puede afirmar que ese grupo al margen de la ley est haciendo presencia en tal sitio pero s hay una intenci n de cometer atentados
3542042 muestra de ello es la labor que ha permitido decomisar una gran cantidad de explosivos en los ltimos d as y evitar que este tipo de acciones se cumplan
3542043 buscamos hacer una gran reforma fiscal de los departamentos que ser llevada al congreso de la rep blica queremos mejorar el impuesto predial evitando lo lotes de engorde y evitar el fraude de comprar por el debajo del valor real eludiendo impuestos llev ndolos de tr nsito a la facturaci n en vez de declarar o establecer contribuciones de valorizaci n por el mayor valor de los bienes producto de las obras nacionales y locales
3542044 los d ficit siempre han sido menores y los ingresos son mayores y esto le tienen que dar credibilidad al pa s en los escenarios macroecon micos que se construyen
3542045 a partir del 1 de enero de 2009 los colombianos contar n con una renovada canasta familiar
3542046 viol el derecho a la defensa y al debido proceso
3542047 he pedido que se me informe de las causas evidencias incriminaciones de las que se me acusa pero no se ha dado ninguna respuesta entonces hay una violaci n directa sobre mi derecho a la defensa
3542048 pruebas suscritas por los fiscales colombianos que revelan que est n frente a un acto de injurias graves as como de falsificaci n de la verdad de los hechos
3542049 los efectos de estas dos razones son de aproximadamente 700 mil millones de pesos divididos en partes iguales
3542050 he will kill me and chop my body into pieces
3542051 dont kill him but cut off his ears and his nose
3542052 this isnt the time to say i told you so
3542053 weve worked well and its a nice feeling where we are at the moment but theres no euphoria or feeling of told you so there is a much bigger prize
3542054 if we can beat canberra then the play offs are achievable
3542055 i have never felt anything other than what i thought was needed in terms of retaining or attaining the players we have
3542056 im not going to comment on whether brian smith has been vindicated for the changes he made last season
3542057 last year was last year and i will always want the knights to be successful but theres a right and wrong way of doing things and i think the way things were done last year was not right you cant help but put a lot of their success down to the form of kurt gidley and danny buderus
3542058 the decision to re sign kurt gidley early in the season has been the signing of the season
3542059 since chief executive steve burraston locked him up after round one or two he has improved out of sight
3542060 he believed that every child is born with a unique potential his individuality but that this potential remained unfulfilled until it was analysed and transformed by education in accordance with what he regarded as the accumulated values of civilization
3542061 using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of interest to the children presented that topic and questioned them inductively so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known looked back and deductively summed up the lessons achievements then related them to moral precepts for daily living
3542062 found a ready echo in those countries such as the united kingdom france and the united states in which the development of individuality into character appeared particularly well attuned to the prevailing economic political and social circumstances
3542063 i mean the creative process is mysterious i had an obsession
3542064 im now in a place where i can start thinking about my childhood my grandfather lived with us his clothing was from this period he was very important to me and i always was attuned to frank sinatra and other things like that it was a golden age for the united states
3542065 i know it s seen as a repressed period but its really a culturally open period a lot of freedom and a lot of ideas that we associate with the 60s were born in that period and i was interested in those environmentalism attitudes towards materialism bohemianism art plays its just that s something that interesting me
3542066 russia didnt beat the georgian army it defeated the us army

3542081 the band wanted a big name who could easily hold his own and reckon is just the man for the job
3542082 by hip hop show standards the fest ran like clockwork despite a no show from mf doom and a near no show from method man yet the sheer size of the san manuel handicapped the early acts especially de la soul who tried valiantly to forge unity among a crowd scattered sparsely general admission festival grounds would have changed the days vibe entirely
3542083 you know a music festival is stacked to the gills with talent when a top act is stuck playing the 2 30 p m slot in the scorching san bernardino summer sun
3542084 but rock the bells isnt just any festival having emerged in its fifth year as the genres preeminent annual event with the pomona based guerilla union seemingly topping itself each time in assembling a veritable murderers row of artists
3542085 at that time i was told that i would probably never be able to use my arms and hands again let alone my legs or think about walking
3542086 the device tells my muscles to actually lift my foot and allow me to take a normal step the normal heel toe step that you would use when you walk
3542087 whats unique about the device is it has a sensor in the heel that picks up when a patients heel is coming down and when a patients heel is coming off the floor
3542088 thats the first time my foots been able to move like that in four years on its own
3542089 we see this as being an excellent training tool for many patients to help them move forward during their early rehabilitation we also see it as an excellent tool for further down the road for more outpatient programs to help a person make progress forward

3542103 this years weak economy has resulted in extremely volatile ad markets with major advertisers scrambling to allocate budgets where they will get the most bang for the buck

3542118 the territory of israel represents a significant market for asi and our products we are looking forward to working with mr barak to introduce our remarkable line of products such as tankskin and aztik armor 100 to the israeli marketplace
3542119 i am excited about the opportunity to introduce asis products such as tankskin and aztik armor to israel because they will have a significant impact in the protection of idf soldiers and israeli law enforcement as well as the overall security of israel additionally i am excited to work with the asi team many of whom have personal experience fighting in the contemporary 360 degree asymmetrical battlefield that idf soldiers are confronted with on a daily basis asi has an intimate understanding of the battleground realities and is crafting solutions that will protect israels warriors
3542120 mr barak will be a tremendous addition to the asi distribution and marketing network his geographic military and industry expertise in israel coupled with his passion to provide armor and ballistic solutions that will have a substantial impact in the overall security of idf soldiers and israeli police will help asi to gain a strategic foothold in the region we are truly fortunate to have mr barak join our team
3542121 it is time to start looking after myself and my family
3542122 my departure and seclusion in najaf is my response to all the mistakes we have made in the mahdi army
3542123 we fought for 50 days and in the end iraqi soldiers came and violated the sanctity of our homes

3542133 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
3542134 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
3542135 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
3542136 we are working with the uk bee farmers association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of 25 000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases
3542137 we do not deny that honeybee health is at risk frankly if nothing is done about it the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years
3542138 research is vital into varroa bee breeding and the nosema parasite
3542139 we are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk
3542140 significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties

3542157 he said come with me i dont care about your family and that was it
3542158 we had an officer in the area for an unrelated situation she saw the officer and this 5 year old had the sense to stay on her bike and park by the police car
3542159 at first i didnt believe it because you never think it can happen to your own kid
3542160 my kid was awesome she did everything she was supposed to do
3542161 very smart she did the right thing didnt panic we always teach kids to scream and yell which is great but she did a good thing by going over and standing by the officers car
3542162 i want to know what his intentions were and if negative him to be dealt with
3542163 i am proud of her and shes a big girl and she did well
3542164 i think any increase in any service right now is upsetting due to the economy and the way things are right now
3542165 but as the price of generating electricity increases the rate the customers have to pay must increase also
3542166 given energy rates generally it doesnt strike me as out of the ordinary
3542167 we do have a very low cost resource much lower cost than the utilities in surrounding states
3542168 our prices when compared regionally are among the lowest in the nation
3542169 de modo geral aprovamos os seis princ pios do cessar fogo e do acordo para a solu o do conflito
3542170 dan ia berkata kepada petrus tidakkah kamu sanggup berjaga jaga satu jam dengan aku
3542171 yesus naik ke atas bukit untuk berdoa seorang diri ketika hari sudah malam ia sendirian di situ
3542172 pagi pagi benar waktu hari masih gelap ia bangun dan pergi ke luar ia pergi ke tempat yang sunyi dan berdoa di sana
3542173 tidakkah kamu sanggup berjaga jaga satu jam dengan aku berjaga jagalah dan
3542174 atau kamu berdoa juga tetapi kamu tidak menerima apa apa karena kamu salah berdoa sebab yang kamu minta itu hendak kamu habiskan untuk memuaskan hawa nafsumu
3542175 sesungguhnya tangan tuhan tidak kurang panjang untuk menyelamatkan dan pendengaran nya tidak kurang tajam untuk mendengar tetapi yang merupakan pemisah antara kamu dan allahmu ialah segala kejahatanmu dan yang membuat dia menyembunyikan diri terhadap kamu sehingga ia tidak mendengar ialah segala dosamu
3542176 how much should my legs hurt after a long run
3542177 its ok dante do you want to read a book what book do you want to read here this one is all about puppies
3542178 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3542179 saya nggak boleh egois saya punya penggemar toh video klip saya beredar di mana mana dengan baju terbuka juga
3542180 i have been contacted by three well known black malle teachers to step back and let the entire community both black and white take the lead
3542181 i immediately identified that as similar and through a course of investigation we were able to identify that as the same letter writer mr haynes
3542182 he advised us he was very concerned about what was going on in the united states and he wanted to see if he could get commissioner greene to act on some of the things that were bothering him and that was the intent according to him
3542183 the main thing is we just wanted to put the fears of the commissioner to rest that we know who this individual is and we talked to him
3542184 we made our presentation to state attorneys office and theyre not going to file on him
3542185 commissioner greene did not pull the trigger and it seems that this issue is coming in as it is coming in and that everything has happened because of her
3542186 maybe the way she played on the little word murder versus killed kids were killed
3542187 saya menangis karena saya bahagia bahagia krena tuhan yesus telah menyelamatkan anak saya
3542188 terus terang dia anak manja tapi saya hargai dia bisa tidur di tempat yang begitu

3542190 you just felt it out the amount of pressure that lifted off their shoulders for about 20 minutes after that we couldnt get the ball and we slipped into our shells
3542191 a great success for his young team eight of who are eligible for the world under 20 championships in chile later this year
3542192 im pretty proud of the team theyve taken some big steps in the last month in the build up coming into the olympics
3542193 genuinely believed they could beat the united states and were disappointed to have only drawn 2 2 with ninth ranked japan and to have lost 0 1 to past olympic champion norway
3542194 some of our players may also get the opportunity to play in some of the better competitions around the world said herdman citing midfielders kirsty yallop and hayley moorwood winger ali riley and goalkeeper jenny bindon as prime candidates
3542195 in games i thought we should have won drawn with japan and lost by one goal to norway before
3542196 i hope we get the backing from sparc and the new zealand olympic committee in the future to keep investing in this team so we can really push on and try to get something going for the future herdman said
3542197 we need that financial backing because we know new zealand football are 100 per cent behind womens football
3542198 look at the potential in this team look at what it could achieve at the world cup in 2011 when the amy ercegs and ria percivals who are just 18 and a 19 year old katie hoyle get more experience
3542199 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3542200 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3542201 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3542202 will continue exploring other remedies for the broader marketplace to further protect investors from distort and short artists
3542203 because the circumstances around the sec emergency order were so unusual im not sure we can gather any real lessons from trading activity during this period
3542204 i think theres curiosity about whether there will be any changes in trading but i havent heard any specific concerns
3542205 we do not have enough information to reasonably estimate losses we may incur arising from the computer intrusion
3542206 and it got infected with an sql injection anyone reading about the olympics on this site risked getting infected
3542207 its important to realize that afp is not to blame
3542208 but if you are syndicating content around the web you might be wise to inform your customers and users of the importance of properly hardening their infrastructure to avoid bringing your companys name into disrepute
3542209 any popular news source is going to be targeted for an attack because of the volume of traffic
3542210 we are a wee bit slow out of the start but once we find our style we can put a bit of a move on
3542211 i know we made a few people in the stands a bit nervous because ive got a few texts saying
3542212 we dont place too much emphasis on the times because the races can be so different
3542213 it is more the pattern of the splits that we will look at well look at the two times but the important thing is we are in the final that has been the no 1 goal and now weve managed that
3542214 weve got one more race now which we want to race our best in and i feel we are peaking at the right time
3542215 we arent thinking about medal per say just how to beat each boat and we will fight our way down the course and see if that is good enough
3542216 as your ie is rendering those html instructions there could be malicious code embedded in those pages that will allow code to be downloaded and executed on that web page without the users knowledge or intervention
3542217 i think this is really like a perfect storm for microsoft office because each and every component is affected
3542218 since there is broad reliance on ipsec to establish secure encrypted communications for companies sharing critical information among remote offices this one is especially important to look at
3542219 this could allow attackers to steal windows messenger user ids and then invite other people to audio and video conferences pretending to be the victim
3542220 this is sort of a different vulnerability that we have not seen too many times before it could also allow the attackers to look at the chat sessions of victims
3542221 usually all it takes is one person finding out then they give the exploit code to everyone else
3542222 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
3542223 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity in fact she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make what follows is the inside account of how the campaign for the seemingly unstoppable democratic nominee came into being and then came apart
3542224 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3542225 my guess is that penns career as a a list political consultant was probably over anyway but hopefully this drives a final nail into his coffin what a sleaze
3542226 hillary clintons campaign revealed as many of us noticed someone who did not have basic leadership skills a lot of hope an admix of self righteousness and a good deal of anger but not the ability to make decisions she couldnt control her own staff and didnt seem to make an effort to exert leadership
3542227 personnel is policy the old saying goes and hillarys campaign had assembled a cadre of second raters in top positions but this is entirely the candidates fault the candidate is always ultimately in charge of his own campaign and if hillary put the wrong people in charge she has no one to blame but herself
3542228 what with team hillarys old melodrama and team edwardss new one those no drama with obama signs the obama staff hung all over their chicago office are starting to look like just the right mantra
3542229 these people arent all nuts though it seems after reading this hillary was just such a frontrunner with so many advantages that each of her top advisers was going out of his or her mind 24 hours a day not wanting to be the one that blew it as a result they just fought all the time these very smart individuals and ended up blowing it as a team and thats quite an achievement
3542230 im not particularly outraged by this let mark be mark the fact is if anything it looks like clinton ultimately held back no i was pretty pissed about that hard working white voters remark but for some reason ive come to think of it as a slip let me expound on that not a slip like clinton didnt mean it but a slip like its exactly what she meant it just wasnt supposed to be a dog whistle it was the un pc truth at least from her twisted perspective
3542231 i trust that after this we wont hear all that much more about how the evil republicanses are working to make barack obama look un american let history record that it was the clinton campaign that sought to beat everyone to the punch on that issue and it was a strategy they followed with a surprising degree of devotion as well recall the picture of barack obama dressed up in somali tribal wear that the clintons released to the public by leaking it to the drudge report recall as well hillary clintons statement that barack obama was not and is not a muslim as far as i know the clinton campaign went out on the warpath to make obama look like the other very early in the game these tactics are of course despicable the only mildly amusing thing about them is that the clinton campaign and all of the democrats associated with it acted more like their conception and caricature of karl rove than the real karl rove ever did
3542232 barack obama has twiced smeared john mccain and the republican party as racist and fearmongering but perhaps that may be better explained as projection politico reports that a campaign strategy of xenophobia didnt come from the gop it will also have one other effect and thats to put the race card out of reach for barack obama he cant call mccain a racist and a fearmonger again without first pointing the finger publicly to the clintons who obviously went a lot farther than mccain would ever countenance along those lines mccain all but forbid the mention of jeremiah wright by his campaign or surrogates this could also rip the veneer of inclusionism off of identity politics and expose it for the tribalism that it is these memos and the democratic infighting demonstrate the corrosiveness of identity politics and its eventual outcome division bitterness and loss that will help improve american politics in the long run as we focus on ideas and philosophy and not the color of skin internal plumbing or ethnicity of our great grandparents
3542233 overall clinton lost 100 points of support among black voters in about 120 days a truly remarkable achievement since black voters make up about 20 percent of the democratic primary electorate a 100 point swing among black voters translates to a 20 point swing among all voters and that essentially was how the primary was lost it is clear from reading the penn memos that the clinton campaign had very little idea this was coming there is abundant discussion about how to squeeze every last nanometer of a vote out of groups like waitress moms but very little substance about how to build or retain their support among african americans clinton to her credit declined to press many of penns more venomous lines of attack although they came out occasionally through surrogates including clintons husband more fundamentally though one senses that the clinton campaign simply took the black community for granted and didnt understand how certain of their core lines of argument might go over with african americans in particular clintons claims to being experienced were always fairly specious considering that she had spent barely more time in elected office than obama less if you count his years in the illinois state senate and had relatively few accomplishments to her name
3542234 the article and leaks hurt hillary and the timing of the release right before the democratic convention is especially damaging it helps obama to portray hillary in the worst light possible
3542235 no doubt the clinton hating obama blogs will cluck cluck cluck with satisfaction over this one seen as validation the internal memos hinted at in allens piece and dished about recently the subject of which has been whispered about among political junkies for months will also likely spur people on to asking more about hillarys campaign and what exactly went wrong and whos to blame however many will simply not write this tale until after november most democrats dont want to do anything to distract from winning
3542236 first edwards now this stuff are the stars converging to sabotage the democrats or are we doing it to ourselves remarkable
3542237 not to re litigate the primary wars but clinton spokesperson howard wolfson tells abc news that were it not for john edwards hillary clinton would have beaten barack obama in iowa
3542238 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3542239 iowa actually didnt turn out to be that close with obama defeating edwards by 7 9 points and hillary clinton by 8 1 points for clinton to have beaten obama she would have needed as wolfson correctly points out about two thirds of those edwards voters the thing about iowa however is that unlike virtually any other electoral contest second choices matter since democratic caucus rules dictate that a voter may caucus for her second choice candidate if her first choice does not achieve the 15 percent of the vote required for viability as such iowa pollsters did a lot of work in trying to determine voters second choices and in virtually every survey clinton did rather poorly as a second choice an average of several surveys in december showed that she was the second choice of about 20 percent of voters as compared with 25 percent for obama and edwards so the odds are that if john edwards had dropped out on the morning before the iowa caucus obama would have won by more points rather than fewer it was also the case that barack obama appeared to get the lions share of edwards supporters once edwards dropped from the race wolfson is making a much cruder sort of argument based on the polls and the evidence cuts against him
3542240 so if clinton was truly the second choice of edwards voters they sure had a funny way of showing it voting for obama in huge numbers
3542241 here was excuse mongering as art if you count only the primary states were winning if you count florida and michigan were winning if you count the states with the most electoral votes were winning now its if the john edwards story had broke we would have won in its specifics this claim is preposterous recall that clinton lost iowa by almost ten points recall that the clinton campaigns biggest weakness was an utter ignorance of caucuses recall that after edwards dropped out clinton lost eleven straight primaries but in broader terms the worst thing about the clinton campaign is was their complete inability to come to terms with the fact that they were supposed to lose not because barack obama is more of a liberal not because hed make a better president not because clinton supported the war not because bill clinton is amoral but because they ran a losing campaign accountability does not exist with these guys and in that they really are bush lite they had millions of dollars front runner status and allegedly the greatest politician of our era stomping for them and they got their asses handed to them but they cant come to terms with it
3542242 i have no idea what would have happened the night of january 3 2008 if edwards had not been in the race but to ignore the fact that john edwards served as obamas attack dog in iowa when discussing his effect on the race is absurd
3542243 do her people really want to go there if so theyll incite comments like mine it appears hillary is repeatedly doomed by men who cant keep their pants zipped
3542244 look the clintons have their understandable if not always legitimate gripes about losing the nomination but there is just one thing the clinton camp cant ever ever ever complain about can you guess what it is no well here it is you cant whine about smooth talking southern politicians who cheat on their wives and then brazenly lie about it howard wolfson is floating the idea that hillary lost the iowa caucuses and by extension the nomination because that no good john edwards didnt fess up to the american people what a scoundrel that john edwards is
3542245 a wikipedia editor emailed political wire to point out some similarities between sen john mccains speech today on the crisis in georgia and the wikipedia article on the country georgia given the closeness of the words and sentence structure most would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia
3542246 now i love wikipedia and think it is a great resource however lifting your report on a subject directly from an encylopedia is something most people are encouraged to stop doing in oh about the sixth grade if you your policy team and your speech writing team are still doing it when commenting on an international crisis while running for president of the united states thats both pathetic and scary
3542247 its never a good sign when a presidential candidate is caught cribbing foreign policy notes from wikipedia particularly when that candidate is trying to put himself forward as the more serious and experienced choice in the realm of foreign policy but taking a step back its always interesting to think about these stories from the perspective of the shoe being on the other foot what would the reaction have been had this story come out in relation to the other candidate in this case what would have happened had barack obama not john mccain been caught cheating on the 3 am test by appropriating from wikipedia this is a major league embarrassment one that goes a long way towards undercutting the meme that mccain is untouchable on foreign policy
3542248 the alleged plagiarizing strikes me as something of a gaffe which when added to the list points to an embarrassing situation mccain thinks czechoslovakia is still a countrybetween sudan and somalia hes confused about how many u s troops are in iraq hes confused about irans relationship with al qaeda and he doesnt understand the difference between sunni and shiia and now mccain cant give a speech about the war in georgia without relying on an online encyclopedia for content
3542249 cqs suggestion of wrongdoing by mccain strikes me as ridiculous the information that the mccain campaign apparently obtained from wikipedia is simple factual background material the idea that he should have cited wikipedia as his source for basic factual information about georgia is absurd cqs taegan goddard wonders whether a presidential candidate should base policy speeches on material from wikipedia but mccain was not basing any policy prescription on the apparently accurate background information contained in wikipedia e g the fact that georgia adopted christianity early on or that it gained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 rather it is clear from the face of the speech that mccain has first hand knowledge of the current situation in georgia having met he says with president saakashvili many times including during several trips to georgia cq elects to omit this fact this story then looks like much ado about nothing and im surprised that cq decided to run it
3542250 i agree that its probable that mccains speechwriter s looked at the wikipedia entry for basic facts when crafting the historical portion but thats hardly plagiarism or frankly even noteworthy its hardly a novel finding that there was a russian revolution that georgia was annexed in 1922 that the soviet union collapsed in 1991 and that georgia struggled mightily in its early years of independence more importantly a political speech isnt a term paper for one thing candidates seldom write them so theyre almost always passing off others work as their own
3542251 amazing how dismissive the left was when bloggers accused obama of lifting whole passages from other peoples speeches and yet the left is perfectly willing to accuse john mccain of plagiarism by accurately recounting georgias history here again is the take away point mccain has gotten so much good press for his statements and speeches on georgia clearly contrasting his experience with barack obamas inexperience the left must discredit mccain they cannot build up obama they must tear down mccain even if it means theyll grasp at straws to do it
3542252 but as a writer and former professional journalist i know from plagiarism and i think mccains detractors are jumping on this one a little too quickly i think the only reason there is any controversy is because the first quoted passages about georgia and christianity are obviously very similar they are also very short and in all three examples the text is purely expository none of it expresses any thoughts feelings emotions or other content that would be an obvious case of intentional plagiarism additionally its worth noting that historical facts cannot be plagiarized only their expression if there is any here its probably inadvertent of course if the campaign did plagiarize it at least wikipedia is released under a free public license
3542253 cohens district is mostly black if the priority is to address the needs and concerns of black americans then i assume that means the black folks in tn 09 who voted for cohen as their representative unlike in 2006 where his mandate was questionable because he won with a small percentage of the vote in a crowded field cohens victory this year 79 to 18 represents a conclusive rejection of the presumption that he needs to be black to best represent them this isnt about giving cohen honorary black status its about making sure the needs of his constituents are better served as it stands clay has essentially said addressing the needs of the black community in memphis is less important than making cohen understand that he isnt black im pretty sure hes figured that out by now
3542254 its been a while since i suited up and dumpster dived in the obama conspiracyverse
3542255 republican operatives have unearthed critical information on obama and are just biding their time until after the convention to drop it on him such as having a birth certificate that lists you as barry soetoro incredible ann dunham met her second husband lolo soetoro in 1966 in hawaii barry obama was at this time five years old the only reasonable explanation is that dunham and soetoro built or purchased a to clone a new son using dna from barack obama sr that dunham had pulled off one of his combs

3542259 the internet is a critical resource not only for government ministries but also in assisting the running of countries and such disruption can damage economies and impact the running of services
3542260 it is very interesting that georgia has turned to using the google blogger service as a method of communication during such an attack and it has proved to be a sustainable resource governments will need to have strategies in place to prepare for this type of attack
3542261 we are witnessing in this crisis the birth of true operational cyber warfare
3542262 the use of cyber attack assets in conjunction with kinetic military operations in the current crisis now stands among the most significant developments ever seen in the field of information security or cyber conflict studies
3542263 moreover that the attackers are mostly decentralized civilians suggests that the evolution of political and strategic hacking will be messier and more disruptive than even pessimistic strategic theorists have supposed

3542270 cryptography is notoriously hard to get right and if improperly used can create serious security holes

3542273 i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance
3542274 companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognise that information security is business driven and not crisis driven

3542281 senator mccain opened his remarks talking about his conversation with the georgian president talking about the crisis there saying that he believes that there is a true strategic imperative for the world to take notice and make sure that georgia is protected because of its oil pipeline one that does provide energy access across the caspian sea the black sea a very very important position for energy independence for the united states to make sure that those sorts of things are protected
3542282 it is crucial that the voting process be as simple and clear as possible and certainly the clearest representation of my candidacy occurs by listing both parties nominations
3542283 the independent party has been very supportive in a political climate that too often places party loyalty above the good of the nation and im enthusiastic about their commitment to bipartisan reform
3542284 and am grateful to have the support of both the republican and independent parties we need to build these types of bridges and work together if we want to get our country back on track hopefully the voters join me in believing that ideas matter more than the party initial after my name
3542285 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3542286 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3542287 an obama presidency will mean zero income taxes for you
3542288 among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3542289 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3542290 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3542291 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3542292 as a result these official estimates commonly overstate both the amount of tax revenue that will be generated by tax increases and the amount of revenue the government will lose due to tax rate reductions
3542293 is roughly equal to the daily production rate of just one new offshore platform in the gulf of mexico
3542294 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
3542295 would provide the kingdom with oil for the coming 700 years
3542296 the united states has 2 trillion barrels of oil shale
3542297 this is more than seven times the amount of crude oil reserves found in saudi arabia and is enough to meet current u s demand for over 250 years
3542298 the u s could completely end its dependence on opec by 2020
3542299 even a moderate estimate of 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil from oil shale in the green river formation is three times greater than the proven oil reserves of saudi arabia
3542300 present u s demand for petroleum products is about 20 million barrels per day
3542301 if oil shale could be used to meet a quarter of that demand the estimated 800 billion barrels of currently recoverable oil from the green river formation could last for more than 400 years

3542303 corporations seem to be able to get away with poisoning the very entity we rely on for our well being with no punishment or very little punishment

3542316 russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
3542317 the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of democratically elected government are at stake
3542318 russia has used violence against georgia to send a signal to any country that chooses to associate with the west and aspire to our shared political and economic values
3542319 russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance
3542320 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and avoid escalation into a full scale war
3542321 i am sorry sir i do not give out that kind of information

3542329 my confession i am a jew and every single one of my ancestors was jewish and it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up bejeweled trees christmas trees i dont feel threatened i dont feel discriminated against thats what they are christmas trees it doesnt bother me a bit when people say merry christmas to me i dont think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto in fact i kind of like it it shows that we are all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year it doesnt bother me at all that there is a manger scene on display at a key intersection near my beach house in malibu if people want a cr eche its just as fine with me as is the menorah a few hundred yards away i dont like getting pushed around for being a jew and i dont think christians like getting pushed around for being christians i think people who believe in god are sick and tired of getting pushed around period i have no idea where the concept came from that america is an explicitly atheist country i cant find it in the constitution and i dont like it being shoved down my throat or maybe i can put it another way where did the idea come from that we should worship celebrities and we arent allowed to worship god as we understand him i guess thats a sign that im getting old too but there are a lot of us who are wondering where these celebrities came from and where the america we knew went to in light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh this is a little different this is not intended to be a joke its not funny its intended to get you thinking billy grahams daughter was interviewed on the early show and jane clayson asked her how could god let something like this happen regarding katrina anne graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response she said i believe god is deeply saddened by this just as we are but for years weve been telling god to get out of our schools to get out of our government and to get out of our lives and being the gentleman he is i believe he has calmly backed out how can we expect god to give us his blessing and his protection if we demand he leave us alone in light of recent events terrorists attack school shootings etc i think it started when madeleine murray ohare she was murdered her body found a few years ago complained she didnt want prayer in our schools and we said ok then someone said you better not read the bible in school the bible says thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal and love your neighbor as yourself and we said ok then dr benjamin spock said we shouldnt spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self esteem dr spocks son committed suicide we said an expert should know what hes talking about and we said ok now were asking ourselves why our children have no conscience why they dont know right from wrong and why it doesnt bother them to kill strangers their classmates and themselves probably if we think about it long and hard enough we can figure it out i think it has a great deal to do with we reap what we sow funny how simple it is for people to trash god and then wonder why the worlds going to hell funny how we believe what the newspapers say but question what the bible says funny how you can send jokes through e mail and they spread like wildfire but when you start sending messages regarding the lord people think twice about sharing funny how lewd crude vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace but public discussion of god is suppressed in the school and workplace are you laughing yet funny how when you forward this message you will not send it to many on your address list because youre not sure what they believe or what they will think of you for sending it funny how we can be more worried about what other people think of us than what god thinks of us pass it on if you think it has merit if not then just discard it no one will know you did but if you discard this thought process dont sit back and complain about what bad shape the world is in my best regards honestly and respectfully ben stein
3542330 im told by insiders that tori asked for a rate hike after discovering that jennie and shannen were signed for 40 000 to 50 000 per episode while tori was getting less than 20 000 per episode her request was denied so tori backed out of the deal altogether

3542382 summers hits are quintessential disco and have any number of connections with modern house music and r amp b i feel love in particular created an archetype that resonated through decades of soul be it an r amp b vocal style syncopation and rhythmic innovation or just raw emotion translated through music accompanied by machines it directly informed technos invention it surfaced again when inner city london married hip hop dancehall rave and sampled breakbeats to make hardcore and jungle and it continues to happen in genres like two step garage and bassline combining the human with the artificial to create something more than either
3542383 donnas work with giorgio moroder helped push the new and foreign euro style into the mainstream and helped to catapult her into that mainstream popularity otherwise she would have been relegated to the middle of the road disco road she was following many a diva wouldnt be who she is without the producer and vice versa moroders style and his euro counterparts gino soccio barricentro klein amp mbo and s f s megatone records with patrick cowley who remixed summers i feel love have influenced me immensely
3542384 it cannot be underestimated how influential moroders production work with donna summer has been on electronic music i feel love took disco into a new electronic direction the galloping synth bassline became the blueprint for italo disco and heavily influenced chicago house and detroit techno it was a track that was way ahead of its time there are also tracks like bad girls and hot stuff that are just great songs and put to shame most modern pop productions
3542385 hes a lying criminal and i would hope he ends up going to jail one day for the things hes done

3542391 i think the recession has a lot to do with it
3542392 when gas is 4 50 a gallon people have less money to go out and do stuff i think a one man show mom and pop business in the city has a lot to go up against and its a very competitive market to book shows
3542393 between treasure island and outside lands theres at least 60 bands that cant play in the city outside of those festivals
3542394 while it seems like a boom for the city to get a festival like that it can also hurt a small independently owned club
3542395 it became increasingly difficult for one guy to run this club on his own
3542396 i think when it first opened there was a lot of hype and buzz about 12 galaxies
3542397 everyone was excited that there was going to be a music venue of that size in the mission district because theres such a music scene here
3542398 im interested enough to pursue the reasons why its closing

3542406 now because of the financial barrier smaller publishers will have to consolidate which will decrease their presence
3542407 there is a chance that a lot of the pedestals will be partially empty
3542408 originally it was supposed to be done in five years and they have extended it to ten
3542409 thats why we are screwed because we have to pay these high fees for twice as long

3542416 its been a constant curiosity to me that one thing does not parlay into another
3542417 even now sitting here with my hair done up talking to you trying to act like a grownup its all because i want to get more roles for my work there is almost nothing i wouldnt do
3542418 i was little but that sensation of pretending and then having an audience respond was very powerful
3542419 it wasnt intended to be the opening scene so that took some of the pressure off
3542420 we shot it deep into the shoot so by then i knew rays journey movies are always shot out of order and thats one of the fun things although people always say that must be so hard but theres sort of a delight in shooting how you feel after the big moment and then realizing how you have to play the scene that gets you to the after it gives you a very clear path to walk for that shot i was very aware of where the lens was and what it was seeing there is calculation to it beyond that i have to give credit to that part of acting that i dont understand and long to put into words
3542421 sorry we are late but we still want you to be our valentine anonymous
3542422 they are really no different from the ku klux klan in terms of their masks and hatred and their jollies of riding horses around and harassing scientologists

3542426 the tourists offer a first class operation in every facet

3542433 recanalizar esta arteria en principio no tenemos la certeza absoluta porque el co gulo es grande y hay ciertos l mites en los cuales podemos actuar y hay otros en los que tenemos que desistir de recanalizar la arteria para pasar a un segundo procedimiento que es la neuroprotecci n la cual consiste en tratar de bajar el metabolismo del cerebro que no requiera muchos nutrientes
3542434 y vamos a esperar las pr ximas 48 72 horas que son las de mayor riesgo en este tipo de enfermedades
3542435 hay diferentes grados de incapacidad que puede tener inclusive de complicaciones que puedan agravar el estado de salud y esperemos que ste no sea el caso esperamos con buena fe recuperar las funciones de su cuerpo del lado izquierdo
3542436 tenga en la arteria car tida que es la arteria principal que lleva la sangre al cerebro una disecci n carotidia causada porque las tres capas que componen la pared de la arteria se separan
3542437 la disecci n de las arterias tiene muchas causas a veces microtraumas traumas m s evidentes y en raras ocasiones no existe alguna evidencia que preceda a esto quiero dejar esto como un diagn stico muy probable pero presumible a n porque tenemos que revisar bien las radiograf as
3542438 while you were sleeping the world changed in an instant
3542439 is the next generation in the grand tradition of montreal metal bands like
3542440 phantom x s new lineup will premier on august 23rd at orileys in dallas
3542441 part of the reason that republicans i think are obsessed with you hillary is because thats a fight theyre very comfortable having
3542442 its the fight that weve been through since the 90s and what we dont need is another eight years of bickering
3542443 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3542444 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3542445 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3542446 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3542447 the countrys still pretty divided people may want a divided government they want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans
3542448 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3542449 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3542450 there was never a lot of discussion about the issues we work on and he wasnt working with older communities to get out their vote
3542451 hes pretty much unknown on these issues as a result and has a lot of work to do
3542452 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3542453 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
3542454 yesterday kids all over america spent the day looking for easter eggs and today their parents are in new york at bear stearns trying to find their nest eggs today at the white house president bush hosted the annual white house easter egg roll young kids roll easter eggs with spoons across the white house lawn what fun that must be for kids if this was 1908 in more serious news big controversy last week after state department officials looked at passport files of all three major candidates turns out they got a hold of john mccains social security number got his social security number you know what it is three well heres the big brouhaha former new mexico governor bill richardson still thinks hes loyal to the clinton family despite endorsing barack obama loyal he just endorsed barack even bill was more faithful to hillary than that actually the reason this is such a big story is that bill richardson was a member of the clinton cabinet and clinton adviser james carville on good friday he called bill richardson a judas called him a judas well you know there are a lot of biblical references in this race now theyre calling bill clinton jonah because he was once swallowed by a whale and larry craig did not file for re election by the deadline he legally cannot run for office again how about that ironically you know why larry craig missed the filing deadline he was in the mens room a democratic congressman from michigan john dingell wants to put an additional 50 cent tax on every gallon of gasoline gee im starting to understand why the democrats keep blowing these elections see the revenue raised by this goes towards repairing all the damage caused by taxpayers rioting over the fact that gas went up another 50 cents and former new york governor eliot spitzer now in rehab for sex addiction theyre trying to figure out why he wants to have sex with young women with no strings attached i dont know maybe cause hes a guy its just getting worse for him in the new york post today a former madam said that eliot spitzer would pay to watch other couples have sex he would pay to watch other couples have sex well thats something we dont have to worry about the new governor doing we will finally be safe there the president of france said today his country will reduce its arsenal of nuclear weapons because if theres one thing the french hate its being too prepared to defend themselves
3542455 you folks have a nice easter yesterday in new york city was the annual central park easter egg hunt amazing 1 500 eggs they found 1 500 eggs and three dead guys yesterday in new york everybody was in the easter spirit as a matter of fact former governor eliot spitzer he was in the easter spirit he spent the day with someone named bunny did you hear about this two state department employees were fired this is a bit of a scandal because they were looking at barack obamas passport file not only that but the same person was also looking at john mccains civil war records listen to this ladies and gentlemen youre not going to believe this there is a new super toilet on the market being described as high tech low flush senator larry craig just drove one off the lot he said by god ill take that little number senator larry craig from idaho he did not sign up for re election he is not going to run for office again so dont let the stall door hit you on the way out larry after the scandal you get the sordid details this is what i hate were now getting the sordid details with eliot spitzer former governor apparently when he was out whoring during sex he would always wear his black socks i know what you are thinking thanks dave for searing that image in our brains for me the only thing i keep on is my hair piece black socks well for heavens sakes who does this guy think he is rosie odonnell
3542456 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
3542457 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
3542458 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
3542459 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
3542460 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
3542461 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
3542462 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
3542463 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
3542464 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
3542465 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
3542466 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
3542467 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
3542468 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
3542469 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
3542470 we see the ftc as absolutely critical but the states should be partners in this as well
3542471 if we had all hands on deck we could really make some progress in addressing this problem
3542472 there must be a recognition that online fraud is a huge threat to consumers as well as a threat to online commerce
3542473 version 1 2 fixes all known issues and is currently under review with apple
3542474 yo no estoy satisfecho con la tendencia que hemos tenido en los pasados meses y el superintendente de la polic a va a estar haciendo los ajustes desde el punto de vista de supervisi n fortalecer las reas que necesitan fortalecerse
3542475 siempre hemos tenido unas tendencias c clicas en t rminos de la conducta criminal tenemos que parar el crecimiento de este momento y volver a la tendencia de reducci n que hab amos logrado durante los primeros tres a os
3542476 vamos a continuar instalando c maras de seguridad particularmente en el rea de ponce y vamos a acelerar esos procesos para darle todas las herramientas a la polic a
3542477 yo te puedo decir que vamos a terminar el cuatrienio con menos asesinatos que en el del 2004 este a o 2008 vamos a ver esperamos hacerlo
3542478 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest of all time
3542479 ngayon ko lang nalaman ganito pala sabi ko na eh
3542480 in order to be a great defense you have to deliver a blow up front run to the ball and tackle thats what weve been doing
3542481 if one day you wake up and youre tired and dont feel like doing it then youre just a soft person its that type of mentality that i really see rubbing off on guys
3542482 cuando l estaba sentado en su mesa un grupo de treinta personas le pidieron una foto un poco caliente con una fan tica

3542484 dac ma njuri pe blog la tine nu comenta pe blog la mine
3542485 i dont understand why so many people like x here are some reasons why i think people like x im not sure if theyre true because again i dont understand it but im using them because theyre the easiest reasons to mock and rebut although easy is a relative term i still have to cherry pick my anecdotes facts and statistics to make my argument which im not really sure why im making because as a purported conservative i ought not to rail against what harmless things people enjoy in their spare time and did i mention i dont understand it anyway x sucks
3542486 nosotros y la facci n del mdc liderada por mutambara hemos firmado el acuerdo tsvangirai no firm el pacto porque b sicamente est intentando que retrocedamos para volver a negociar cuestiones sobre las que ya nos hab amos puesto de acuerdo
3542487 el presidente va a formar un gobierno de unidad nacional que incluir a miembros de la oposici n
3542488 las conversaciones no han fracasado s lo es una pausa
3542489 el presidente ha dicho que las conversaciones no han fracasado
3542490 lamarr has played really physical this camp thats what ive been most pleased with
3542491 its very difficult the hardest place to play is when youve got to move closer to the ball because it happens a lot faster with the bigger bodies in there
3542492 hes done a great job transitioning from end to tackle i was telling him today ive been real proud of his effort and what hes been doing as physical as hes been playing
3542493 hes in great shape hes done everything right hes worked really really hard
3542494 brian has been really good for sam telling him no youve got to be better
3542495 this senior class has been a lot better about coaching the younger ones than our previous two senior classes were we think its bringing some of those young guys along better
3542496 hes got a live leg that ball gets so high when he kicks it
3542497 the other thing is hes punting really well hell be in the mix with trevor gerland and jon gold for those duties
3542498 i thought man im feeling exactly the way he feels
3542499 thats a guy you love to coach because when you tell him something he takes it to heart he takes it personal
3542500 those are the guys who usually are the good players because theyve got the intangibles in life that some other guys dont have he certainly has those qualities
3542501 the desire to beat the other person off the ball
3542502 we all think hell be an all american by the end of the season
3542503 hes coming to assess my house for a reverse mortgage
3542504 reverse mortgages for some reason i cant fathom are a product that a lot of people love to hate
3542505 there are a lot of negative attitudes about them that are not supported by fact
3542506 in all circumstances the answer to whether or not theyve actually received complaints or taken action against any lenders has been no
3542507 but i have heard of people who execute the instrument improperly
3542508 reverse mortgages are to help liquify their assets not lock them up the only person this benefits is the broker
3542509 when we moved in we sat down and wrote a philosophical statement on a new way of living
3542510 we liked the idea that society could become more open and we believed that architecture should pursue larger ideas
3542511 its kind of ironic we chose one of the oldest wooden houses to pursue that
3542512 basically we spent our money on preschools swimming lessons and summer camps
3542513 it feels like living in the belly of a whale because you can see the skeleton of the house
3542514 were like everyone else mortgaged up to the gills and we cant see the end of it
3542515 we thought we would have one child and that child would learn how to live without walls
3542516 i started remembering how important it was to have my own room as a kid
3542517 we set it up so that we could keep it low cost for artists
3542518 has an obligation to providing safe adequate and livable homes for all residents
3542519 all i found were places with hot and cold running rats places i would never feel safe in
3542520 im asking why a large clean city certified live work space in a mutually supportive intentional community where ive lived for 37 years is not eligible for the voucher program yet 200 square foot studios in buildings older than ours visibly infested with vermin in physically dangerous and malodorous unhealthy areas of the city are eligible for the housing choice voucher
3542521 i always have fantastic qualified tenants for any of our units near the shuttle stops
3542522 theyre selective but they will pay a premium for quality
3542523 we worked with him for three months but never found something that fit his precise criteria
3542524 im working with a couple that is specifically looking for a home condo near the google line they have made several offers but were outbid every single time
3542525 last week i had two properties open in noe valley and both had about 50 groups go through them so theres still a lot of traffic
3542526 it used to be you got a job in the city and commuted to the suburbs with a yard but google really predicted the spirit of this generation they want to live in the city and they dont want to drive their cars
3542527 hes so aggressive right now i think brian orakpo has been good for sam to tell him get here faster or you gotta be tougher
3542528 this senior class the older guys are doing a lot better job of coaching the younger ones than our previous two years we think its bringing some of those younger ones on quicker
3542529 sam acho eddie jones and henry melton gave us the chance to move lamarr houston inside and not have a dropoff
3542530 its not that much of a difference to me i played left tackle all through high school and when i started out here i played left
3542531 as a swing guy i went to right tackle when cedric dockery went down its just switching from right technique to left technique its not a big deal
3542532 hes pure size hes 320 something pounds but he doesnt look like it you look at him and he can really move
3542533 hes a great christian young man you put him on that field and all he does is block people and get after them it doesnt feel outwardly as nasty but hes got a great tenacity level
3542534 if they dont have that theyre going to have a hard time playing so all of them i would like to think have a good degree of it
3542535 i get a little bit of time with john chiles every day quite a bit hes doing a nice job i think you can definitely see spurts where hes very comfortable there
3542536 working on the little things is always a challenge for any wide receiver john taking a bunch of snaps at quarterback and then coming out in certain packages and playing wideout its just going to be a learning process for him
3542537 this dog of a case gave the court a great amount of facts to chew upon and applicable law to sniff out nonetheless having thoroughly gnawed through the record this court finds that no material dispute of fact remains and summary judgment is appropriate on all counts
3542538 tipping my hand as to my theory on what happened could be to the detriment of jimmys case and i dont want to do that
3542539 were taking the position the two guys were encouraging the girls and that they tried to catch the bra
3542540 the most aggressive online enforcers setting an example for others to follow
3542541 the sword of justice can prevail in the virtual world
3542542 our consumer protection division remains at the center of the cybercrime combat zone because weve strengthened our forces and armed ourselves with the best investigative tools and legislation
3542543 first there must be recognition that online fraud is a huge threat to consumers as well as to the future of online commerce
3542544 we go out and look for scams in addition to responding to
3542545 a summary judgment motion is a procedural thing basically were saying hey judge we dont need a trial just tell us who wins
3542546 we agree on what the facts are for the most part its a legal question for the judge to say its ok or its not ok
3542547 accident including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions
3542548 to establish a causal connection between their claimed injuries and the citys conduct
3542549 there is no documentation of a causal connection anywhere in papers filed in this motion the plaintiffs evidence thus is insufficient
3542550 we argued both that the suit had no basis in fact and that the plaintiffs had made a number of fundamental legal errors in filing it
3542551 but the judge didnt make this ruling on technical grounds his decision speaks directly to the question of whether there was sufficient evidence to support the claims against the city
3542552 oh we proved it but they proved you cant fight city hall
3542553 this may clear the docket but it does not clear the air
3542554 those wickedlocal people are wicked local people for printing that
3542555 many community organisations in the central west and western plains are starved for funding and are unable to initiate vital road safety projects that will ultimately save lives
3542556 nrma wants to help these organisations fix road safety issues that are important to the
3542557 last year the nrma funded a variety of projects including a motorcycle safety campaign a driver mentor program to help migrant drivers get a nsw drivers licence and a child restraint education campaign for new mums and grandparents

3542560 canowindra just doesnt have enough options for childcare which means very little choice for families who wish to return to work or study or just have an occasional break
3542561 also if we change to this model of care and there are still high needs for other childcare like for under 2s it is much easier to then extend the service with capital investment programs available from the federal government
3542562 currently we do not have the funds needed to build on another room nor are staff easily available for this service at present
3542563 we encourage anyone interested in the long term future of childcare in canowindra particularly in relation to the preschool to attend this meeting

3542568 not so long ago it seems we all knew a great uncle harold or aunty irene but sadly it seems these names could soon be lost forever
3542569 it is clear that modern parents are increasingly being influenced by fashions and celebrity however we also need to remember that there are now more choices available
3542570 apart from short sections in the prison service orders on disability and women there remains no national strategy for older prisoners
3542571 there is still far too much reliance on the unsupported initiative of particularly committed officers and too great an assumption that the care of older prisoners including their social care is a matter for health services and not for the whole prison
3542572 an ageing prison population is being squeezed into overcrowded jails designed and run for young men
3542573 as well greater use of community punishments for older offenders ministers should also consider developing specialist secure accommodation for the elderly in cases where a custodial sentence is necessary
3542574 the national offender management service has felt to date that a national strategy for older prisoners was not appropriate

3542593 it is important that all parties go back to what is called the status quo ante that is the status quo as existed on the 6th of august
3542594 there is an urgent need for the very serious humanitarian situation
3542595 and that goes for both sides and it is absolutely necessary and there is a very great urgency there is full access for humanitarian organizations and others to the displaced persons to the victims to the wounded
3542596 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3542597 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3542598 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3542599 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3542600 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3542601 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares

3542640 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3542641 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3542753 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3542754 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3542784 i know it seems sudden to the volunteers and staff
3542785 but the board had been evaluating all of the programs for the san francisco spca since the fall of 07 and looking at and weighing out all of the different pieces of each program the outcomes each program produces the cost of the programs how close they were to our mission and how many animals they saved it was part of the boards process and it was months and months
3542786 the thing i was most concerned about was the real moment of truth
3542787 when the person gets the dog they still have to be trained on how to work their dog
3542788 if all the donations and bequests were added up there would be a different outcome it could have been brought up to meeting its funding requirements if there had been an appeal to the community and the desire to do that
3542789 hdps applicants can go to cci and cci is great organization
3542790 a proportion of the applicants will probably be well suited for their dogs and their program but thats now what about the future
3542791 i taught him sit down and come in about a day
3542792 he was just very bright very trainable highly reward motivated and so easy to teach new behaviors
3542793 yes theyll be lovely pets but somebody needs those skills those dogs have and theyre not getting them now
3542794 these are dogs that were due to make a difference in peoples lives to make their lives easier and help them and now the dogs dont get to do what they were trained to do and the people dont get the help from the dogs so where is that a win
3542795 we have the same commitment to saving lives as we always have

3542803 she was weak wouldnt eat and had a fever for the first time since the accident
3542804 i took her back in to the surgery clinic where she was operated on it was a saturday they took one look at her and called board certified veterinary dermatologist laura stokking and said we dont know what this is but this is a really sick dog dr stokking worked on her all day she had ivs and every inch of her body was cultured
3542805 she had an episode of septicemia blood infection and the sores were all over her body and the hair just sloughed off and they were oozing
3542806 i have never seen a dog that sick that survived
3542807 my husband who is an infectious disease doctor says that in humans when you get these resistant staphylococcus infections they will slough skin for several months
3542808 you know it was easy with angelinas parents because theyre physicians so they know a lot more
3542809 she responded pretty well i have some cases where there is a substantially higher amount of the body thats affected and a lot more tissue necrosis and the dogs are really systemically ill
3542810 up until recently the bacteria that most commonly affected dogs didnt tend to trade resistance information with other bacteria the same way that the staph in humans did
3542811 we dont usually see a link between hospitalization or veterinary visits and the acquisition of this strain of staphylococcus
3542812 we do frequently see a history in infected pets of repeated use of antibiotics
3542813 its better to do a culture and then find out that it would have responded to cephalexin than not culture and let it go three weeks before realizing that youre dealing with a methicillin resistant strain

3542817 within a single speck of dust the whole earth is contained when a single blossom opens the entire universe arises this points to being present in the moment allowing the moment to fill the universe so theres nothing outside and no place to stand to observe it you are the moment and when you are the moment the moment is a hundred thousand eons and a hundred thousand eons are the moment a single thought just one thought and you move away from it heaven and earth are separated good and bad up and down self and other all the dualities appear then the question is but before the particle of dust appears before the blossom opens how will you see it the prologue answers its own question if you cut away all complications and bring out your own treasure you will see that there are originally no seams no gaps not a single flaw or scar and that everything is perfect and complete above and below in front and behind
3542818 its not that things are illusory but that their separateness from the fabric of reality is illusory

3542823 this is actually really interesting this month by my count we have 11 advisories covering 26 vulnerabilities
3542824 there were originally supposed to be 12 advisories but it appears as though the windows media player update was pulled since this was originally marked critical its not good that its pulled
3542825 its like a being given a treasure map thats half completed theres still a lot of space to cover but its significantly smaller than if you had no insight at all

3542828 the critical updates will affect both desktops and servers so it departments will need to quickly and carefully assess which patches should receive priority
3542829 the five critical patches need to get installed as soon as possible this month
3542830 all of these patches can affect client by attack vectors that are used in day to day client side computer use visiting an evil web site or by opening an evil document
3542831 continuing the ongoing trend attackers are increasingly targeting common users and tricking them into accessing a malicious web site or opening an unsolicited document
3542832 todays bulletins mostly deal with user driven applications such microsoft office including word excel powerpoint access and others such as internet explorer outlook express and windows messenger this is something people need to be aware of and prioritize more sooner than later
3542833 we dont know how exactly global warming is to blame for all of this but were sure its the cause
3542834 i can tell you a solution to at least one of the problems
3542835 the candy manufacturers need to make the flavor last longer in their gum so the kids will keep in their mouths instead of sticking it under their seats
3542836 gave a poor excuse as to why she was there
3542837 i can count on one hand the number of people here with any kind of crop this year
3542838 but growers are the ultimate optimists hopefully well have a good crop next year
3542839 i dont care if youre making spark plugs or olives you need a constant flow into the market
3542840 we cant build a market and then say we dont have any olives this year
3542841 all children look and see things that are interesting and i always had been involved with these little animals
3542842 you see them they see you they go and hide i can see the rocks and the trees and the water but i cant see these little bits of life that i know are there where are they going what are they doing
3542843 i think theyre beautiful i really love just seeing them but theres also kind of this science y observation
3542844 i feel like i have a living breathing part of the rainforest in my apartment this world that i dont get to see and that most people dont get to see and its in my living room
3542845 ive been going outside and looking for snakes ever since i was a little kid
3542846 i would catch bugs and snakes and everything else that other girls thought were gross
3542847 i picked up one of my rubber boas and i thought she had a respiratory tract infection
3542848 a snake thats healthy will look around and flick its tongue really often whereas a snake thats not doing so well will tend not to do that
3542849 they wont look around if you hold them theyll be limp and weak
3542850 snakes are probably one of the most misunderstood animals that people keep as pets
3542851 people have a slight biological predisposition to be afraid of animals
3542852 i mean if you step on the wrong one it can bite you and kill you so thats in a way a very reasonable fear to have even though ive never had it but over the years through media entertainment whatnot theres this kind of mythology built up around these animals that there are these monstrous constrictors that will kill you and eat you or get on the school bus and eat your kids
3542853 humans have always regarded snakes with a mixture of inquisitiveness and fear of awe and revulsion
3542854 represented healing to the ancient greeks and knowledge to the incas a serpent tempted eve in the biblical garden of eden and a giant cobra shaded buddha snakes run the metaphorical gamut in aboriginal and modern lore and in the past two decades these limbless creatures have even come into their own as subjects of scientific study
3542855 mean and lowly things snakes science and survival in the congo
3542856 a herpetology collection needed no more purpose to justify its existence than say an art gallery
3542857 we loved amphibians and reptiles and all other animals and plants
3542858 we delighted in the thousands of species of each and agreed that the world would be a sadder place of any were driven to extinction but that explanation alone made me uneasy it made species sound like luxury items to be protected only for aesthetic reasons i wanted an explanation that would convince a nonscientist even someone who did not consider snakes irresistibly attractive

3542887 fair or not as advertising it did its job it used humor stuck viewers with memorable images and created a debate just as lyndon johnsons 1964 daisy ad walter mondales red phone spot 20 years later and hillary rodham clintons 3 a m commercial in 2008 did
3542888 the paris hilton ad also bore a republican political trademark attacking a candidates strengths rather than the candidates weaknesses
3542889 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3542890 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3542891 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
3542892 i know from just what im hearing theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen
3542893 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
3542894 we had a hard fought campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the proverbial roller coaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together
3542895 and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how were going to help in this election
3542896 we are one party we share one vision and we believe as democrats as independents and repentant republicans in the progress we can make together
3542897 we think its a good thing that users can lie
3542898 she started the fire because she believed she would be able to collect crisis management financial assistance from the american red cross
3542899 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3542900 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3542901 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3542902 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3542903 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3542904 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms

3542906 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3542907 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3542908 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3542909 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3542910 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3542911 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3542912 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3542913 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3542914 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3542915 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3542916 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3542917 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3542918 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3542919 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3542920 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3542921 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3542922 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3542923 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3542924 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3542925 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3542926 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3542927 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3542928 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3542929 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3542930 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3542931 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3542932 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3542933 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3542934 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3542935 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3542936 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3542937 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3542938 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3542939 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3542940 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3542941 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3542942 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3542943 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3542944 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3542945 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3542946 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3542947 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3542948 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3542949 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3542950 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3542951 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3542952 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3542953 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3542954 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3542955 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3542956 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3542957 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3542958 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3542959 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3542960 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3542961 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3542962 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3542963 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3542964 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3542965 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3542966 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3542967 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3542968 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3542969 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3542970 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3542971 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3542972 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3542973 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3542974 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3542975 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3542976 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3542977 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3542978 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3542979 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3542980 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3542981 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3542982 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3542983 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3542984 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3542985 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3542986 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3542987 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3542988 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3542989 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3542990 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3542991 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3542992 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3542993 what would happen if we it stopped supporting the end user and we simply only supported from the corporate network in
3542994 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3542995 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3542996 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3542997 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3542998 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3542999 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3543000 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3543001 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3543002 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3543003 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3543004 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3543005 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3543006 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3543007 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3543008 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3543009 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3543010 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3543011 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3543012 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3543013 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3543014 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3543015 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3543016 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3543017 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3543018 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3543019 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3543020 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3543021 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3543022 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3543023 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3543024 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3543025 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3543026 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3543027 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3543028 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3543029 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3543030 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3543031 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3543032 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3543033 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3543034 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3543035 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3543036 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3543037 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3543038 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3543039 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3543040 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3543041 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3543042 just so you all know we did set a record
3543043 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3543044 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3543045 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3543046 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3543047 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3543048 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3543049 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3543050 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3543051 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3543052 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3543053 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3543054 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3543055 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3543056 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3543057 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3543058 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3543059 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3543060 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3543061 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3543062 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3543063 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3543064 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3543065 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3543066 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3543067 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3543068 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3543069 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3543070 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3543071 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3543072 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3543073 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3543074 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3543075 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3543076 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3543077 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3543078 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3543079 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3543080 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3543081 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3543082 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3543083 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3543084 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3543085 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3543086 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3543087 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3543088 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3543089 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3543090 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3543091 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3543092 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3543093 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3543094 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3543095 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3543096 it is difficult to get the news from poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there
3543097 the state of the world calls out for poetry to save it
3543098 your poems must be more than want ads for broken hearts
3543099 dont cater to the middle mind of america nor to consumer society
3543100 dig folksingers who are the true singing poets of yesterday and today
3543101 make permanent waves and not just on the heads of stylish women
3543102 life lived with poetry in mind is itself an art
3543103 it is a pulsing fragment of the inner life an un tethered music
3543104 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3543105 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3543106 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3543107 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3543108 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3543109 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3543110 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3543111 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3543112 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3543113 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3543114 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3543115 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3543116 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3543117 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3543118 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3543119 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3543120 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3543121 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3543122 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3543123 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3543124 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3543125 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3543126 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3543127 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3543128 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3543129 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3543130 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3543131 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3543132 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3543133 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3543134 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3543135 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3543136 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3543137 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3543138 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3543139 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3543140 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3543141 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3543142 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3543143 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3543144 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3543145 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3543146 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3543147 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3543148 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3543149 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3543150 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3543151 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3543152 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3543153 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3543154 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3543155 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3543156 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3543157 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3543158 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3543159 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3543160 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3543161 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3543162 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3543163 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3543164 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3543165 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3543166 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3543167 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3543168 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3543169 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3543170 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3543171 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3543172 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3543173 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3543174 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3543175 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3543176 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3543177 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3543178 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3543179 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3543180 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3543181 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3543182 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3543183 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3543184 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3543185 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3543186 public bodies to be able to access personal details with data available to investigators across europe
3543187 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3543188 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3543189 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3543190 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3543191 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3543192 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3543193 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3543194 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3543195 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3543196 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3543197 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3543198 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3543199 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3543200 a growing world needs more energy but at the same time we need to find new ways of managing carbon emissions to limit climate change continued investment in technology is one of the key ways we are able to address this challenge and continue to secure a profitable and sustainable future
3543201 to unlock the potential of the vast canadian oil sands deposits
3543202 and you cant walk around with chains if youre a known activist because they can be construed as an offensive weapon its harder to construe that with glue
3543203 its difficult for people to move you on the police in britain at least are unlikely to try and rip your hand away and cause injury
3543204 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3543205 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3543206 the complexity of newly engineered systems coupled with their potential impact on lives the environment etc raise a set of ethical issues that engineers had not been thinking about
3543207 our saving grace our inability to affect things at a planetary level is being lost to us
3543208 we need at least to think about what we are doing while we are doing it to be aware of the consequences of our research
3543209 it leaves the door open for people to do something that is going to cause long term problems
3543210 the question now is how best to begin that discussion among the scientists to encourage them to do something like this then figure out what would be the right mechanism who would fund it what form would recommendations take all those details
3543211 scientists and engineers should not be involved in these kinds of ethical questions
3543212 even beginning the discussion putting geoengineering on the table and beginning the scientific work could in itself make us less concerned about all the things that we need to start doing now
3543213 maladapted for situations that call for focused research to resolve societal issues that need to be faced with some urgency
3543214 the sooner there is an opportunity for public discussion the better
3543215 not well designed to handle issues that are not already in a crisis
3543216 with no grand debate over first principles and no accusations of acting in bad faith nanotechnology has received only fitful attention
3543217 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3543218 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3543219 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3543220 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3543221 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3543222 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3543223 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3543224 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3543225 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3543226 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3543227 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3543228 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3543229 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3543230 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3543231 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3543232 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
3543233 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
3543234 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
3543235 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3543236 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3543237 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3543238 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3543239 we will need the spirit of youth in abundance as the world seeks to embrace cleaner more sustainable forms of energy including renewable resources
3543240 youth should therefore be given a chance to take an active part in the decision making of local national and global levels
3543241 and they can actively support initiatives that will lead to the passage of far reaching legislation
3543242 on this international youth day i urge young people around the world to invest their energies and bright ideas into shaping a safer more sustainable planet

3543256 left 4 dead is the new survival co op action game from valve that blends the social entertainment experience of multiplayer games such as counter strike and team fortress with the dramatic narrative experience made popular in single player action game classics such as the half life series of games
3543257 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3543258 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road

3543264 uncertainty and volatility in global credit markets will continue to place upward pressure on funding costs
3543265 we are cautious going into the new financial year and the group will continue with its conservative stance until signs of improvements in economic conditions are evident
3543266 the groups capital position is strong with capital levels well above target ranges
3543267 while these broad trends are clearly evident the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict
3543268 there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy but it is important that we recognise there are potentially a number of positive influences
3543269 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic growth with credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade
3543270 while it is clearly a time to be cautious the current environment presents well managed banks like the commonwealth bank of australia with opportunities to grow even stronger
3543271 our robust financial position has enabled us to maintain the momentum behind our five strategic priorities and we remain committed to further strengthening our core businesses should attractive on strategy investment opportunities arise

3543285 ceea ce credeau cindva filosofii ca merita sa se numeasca viata s a transformat acum in afacere privata si in consecinta in teritoriu genuin al consumului remorca a procesului de productie lipsita de autonomie si de substanta proprie cine doreste sa afle adevarul despre viata nemijlocita trebuie sa i cerceteze fata alienata si odata cu ea fortele obiective ce determina existenta individuala pina in zonele ei cele mai intime

3543298 ce pot sa spun este ca in prima sedinta a cresc se va analiza contestatia ea va fi acceptata sau respinsa daca ar fi acceptata ar insemna ca tot procesul sa fie luat de la capat ceea ce personal ma indoiesc la sedinta au fost reprezentanti de la ministere iar autoritatea de management a avizat deja hotarirea cresc
3543299 nu s au respectat termenele proiectele trebuiau analizate pe masura ce erau depuse principiul primul venit primul servit nu s a respectat noi am depus proiectele in decembrie trebuiau analizate in martie nu in iulie
3543300 proiectele noastre au fost plasate de evaluatorii independenti pe locurile 11 si 12 adica primeau finantare in schimb vor primi finantare proiecte depuse de suceava care au fost plasate de evaluatori pe locurile 17 19 20 21 23 toate vor fi finantate aranjamentul a fost facut de flutur impreuna cu alti membri pdl astfel banii vor ajunge la suceava botosani sau bacau bacaul era fezabil doar cu un proiect proiecte mai slabe vor primi bani sint convins ca ministrul laszlo borbely va putea face ceva
3543301 nichita nu a fost la sedinta a lipsit imi pare rau daca cineva din coasta de azur isi poate da cu parerea despre o sedinta la care nu a fost sa discute cu colegii lui din psd de la vaslui si bacau toata lumea a semnat sint convins ca iasul va primi fonduri dar nu se poate sa fii cistigator din prima chiar el solicita un echilibru judetul iasi are 48 de milioane de euro din cele 140 de milioane de euro de pe regiune sint convins ca nu s a facut nici o nedreptate
3543302 la nivelul cresc se analizeaza si impactul regional al proiectului se analizeaza si alte eventuale surse de finantare iasul poate completa cele doua proiecte si le poate depune pe axa i unde va fi pol de crestere doar municipiul va beneficia pe axa i de cel putin 70 milioane euro
3543303 in decembrie au venit foarte multe proiecte noi am solicitat mai multi evaluatori dar nu am primit decit jumatate astfel am ajuns sa avem evaluari la proiecte depuse in ianuarie sau februarie dar nu si la cele din decembrie am avut o corespondenta cu autoritatea de management s a decis ca toate proiectele sa fie analizate intr o sedinta

3543320 i had gone to a function and when i came home around midnight i saw broken glass on the footpath but i didnt pay much attention to it
3543321 saturday morning we were going out and i said to sophie to watch out for the glass and thats when nicholas saw it
3543322 it had a lot of gunk in it so we dont know what it was used for and it was fresh blood it hadnt congealed
3543323 i think it was random i think someones just thrown it away but you never know
3543324 the joined up approach taken by the three agencies is a welcome step forward and we fully support this initiative it simplifies the whole process of sorting out the mess left behind by fraudsters and helps victims get their finances back on track
3543325 becoming a victim of identity theft can be extremely distressing
3543326 by jointly taking on responsibility for managing the recovery process the three credit reference agencies are aiming to make getting financially back on track much easier for the individual involved
3543327 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3543328 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3543329 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3543330 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people

3543338 the first unhcr humanitarian airlift flight carrying relief supplies for civilians affected by the conflict arrived in georgia this morning as the estimated number of people uprooted by the fighting approached 100 000
3543339 that would amount to some 56 000 people from gori on the move officials said that most had gone toward tbilisi and that most would return home once the threat subsided
3543340 the situation on the ground is deteriorating sparking a significant movement of population
3543341 we need unrestricted humanitarian access to the civilian population and to the wounded and to enable medical personnel and ambulances to take care of the dead and wounded
3543342 one of our top priorities when it is possible will be to get safe drinking water to tskhinvali

3543345 in total am primit 73 de reactii 53 sint pro rcs amp rds iar restul sint impotriva unul dintre avantajele vehiculate este raportul calitate pret comparativ cu restul concurentei de pe piata iar ca dezavantaje au fost mentionate nerespectarea termenului de instalare prevazut in contract si obligarea la plata unor servicii neprestate acum au iesit la iveala si alte spete care ne erau necunoscute ele urmeaza sa fie cercetate in cel mai scurt timp
3543346 aceste intirzieri creeaza nemultumiri si pierderi materiale directe si indirecte abonatilor care daca stiau de la inceput despre acest lucru puteau sa si aleaga un alt operator o alta clauza incalcata este cea care se refera la acordarea in custodie a unui calculator personal si a unui monitor celor care doresc odata cu furnizarea serviciilor de internet lipsa acestei sincronizari face de neutilizat serviciul de internet care in multe cazuri este platit fara insa a fi macar instalat
3543347 studiem in prezent ca masura intermediara suspendarea primirii de noi abonati adica semnarea de noi contracte
3543348 eu am probleme cu rds de cind m am abonat de acum un an nu exista zi in care sa functioneze internetul 24 de ore doua trei zile pe saptamina nu merge internetul fac sesizari peste sesizari si tot ce fac e sa mi ceara mac ul placii de retea numar unic de identificare a placii dat de producator n r cind sun a doua zi sa fac o noua sesizare imi spun ca nu au avut timp sa se ocupe de problema si asa ma duc cu vorba zi de zi
3543349 nu sint de acord cu retragerea rds de pe piata am fost clientii astral apoi ai upc iar acum sintem din fericire clientii rds nu cred ca pot fi comparate serviciile oferite de aceste firme si nici preturile pe care le practica
3543350 miine n r astazi vin la iasi santa si panait prima va face memoriu la federatie pentru ca cei de la alexandria o santajeaza cu un contract pe care ea nu l a semnat iar pentru doina vom discuta pentru grila de transfer cu lps galati o sa mai vina in perioada urmatoare si un alt conducator de joc de la alexandria care a terminat contractul acolo si s a oferit sa joace la noi
3543351 am spus de mai multe ori si vreau sa confirm inca o data sintem putini un popor divizat este o problema si bineinteles ca vom incerca sa ne unim cu osetia de nord
3543352 pacienta nu a avut nevoie de internare pentru ca si a revenit destul de rapid i a fost acordat primul ajutor si a putut ramine acasa
3543353 de cele mai multe ori acesti pacienti nu au probleme medicale grave ci vin la spital mai mult sa si verifice starea de sanatate colegii mei din cabinetele private spun ca in lunile iulie si august au pacienti cit intr o jumatate de an unii dintre ei chiar s au uitat pe lista de preturi si au solicitat pina la urma toate ecografiile si radiografiile posibile

3543362 sa nu stai cinci minute cu ochii in plafonul cinematografului
3543363 este primul film horror realizat in romania ideea ne a venit in luna februarie iar totul a pornit dintr o joaca de atunci am schimbat distributia de trei ori care este alcatuita din actori amatori de filmat propriu zis a durat doar doua luni
3543364 am reusit ca pe parcursul filmarilor sa devenim o familie a fost destul de greu sa realizam acest film am avut chiar momente in care am dorit sa renuntam insa ne au motivat altii
3543365 este adevarat ne am inteles cu julio cesar este un mare jucator care a trecut pe la multe cluburi mari din europa iar maine in cadrul unei conferinte de presa de la ora 13 00 va fi prezentat oficial si va sta la dispozitia ziaristilor

3543368 este adevarat familia mea s a acomodat aici mult mai greu decit am anticipat insa conducerea mi a inteles decizia inainte sa accept o alta provocare voi petrece mai mult timp cu familia
3543369 am ajuns la o virsta la care era vremea sa ma intorc acasa asa ca atunci cind prin intermediul unei persoane foarte apropiate am primit oferta de la stiinta bacau o echipa nou creata care va activa in liga a doua am reflectat citeva zile si am acceptat initial m am gindit sa termin campionatul la poli si sa ma duc la bacau dupa aceea insa a aparut un element care m a deranjat mult nu l voi face public pentru ca nu mi sta in caracter acest lucru si vreau sa ramin doar cu amintiri placute de la iasi unde m am simtit foarte bine
3543370 pentru mine au fost trei ani frumosi in care am reusit sa ne mentinem in elita desi au fost tot felul de probleme cred si sper ca si anul acesta sa fie repetata performanta din trecut sufleteste voi fi alaturi de baieti si sper sa pot veni la meciurile iasului sa i incurajez

3543374 domnule geoana am vazut in ultima vreme replici frecvente la adresa mea si agresive si necinstite nu imi spuneti mie ca legea nu a fost adoptata nu imi reprosati mie acest lucru aveti cel mai mare grup parlamentar
3543375 nimeni nu impiedica un partid de care sinteti apropiat sa vina alaturi de noi in aceasta chestiune
3543376 propun ca acest lucru sa fie discutat cinstit aici dupa ce pleaca presa si nu sa le aducem in discutie pentru consideratii cu priza la public
3543377 nu stiu ce s a intimplat au cumparat caietul de sarcini trei firme dar nu a venit nimeni vom relua procedura
3543378 vrem sa achizitionam panouri de promovare turistica de doua dimensiuni trei bucati de 8 3 m si patru bucati de 4 3 m acestea vor fi utilizate pentru promovarea de trasee turistice din iasi si republica moldova pentru promovarea obiectivelor turistice licitatia mai cuprinde cumpararea a sase casete luminoase 20 de indicatoare turistice si 50 indicatoare de strazi
3543379 nu avem siguranta unui post iar daca vine un calificat ne poate da oricind deoparte
3543380 ma plimb printre elevi le explic sau cind ei sint la tabla stau intr una dintre bancile din spate pentru ca sa i pot urmari pe toti
3543381 la literatura copiii nu se prea descurca nu mai citesc tin minte cum acasa la cozia stateam intr o livada de pruni copil fiind si citeam orice imi pica in mina erau lecturi suplimentare acum copiii nici macar ce trebuie nu citesc
3543382 ce bine va sta doamna diriginta cind sinteti vesela dar cind sinteti suparata ne temem sa ne uitam la dumneavoastra mi a spus un fost elev aceste cuvinte am sa le tin minte cit am sa traiesc eu strunesc friiele atunci cind trebuie dar mai descretesc si fruntea mai glumesc si rid cu ei daca vad ca stau impietriti
3543383 elevii mei trebuie sa invete sa scrie corect si sa judece pina sa dea un raspuns
3543384 am avut clasa de simultan a saptea si a opta este foarte greu sa lucrezi la gimnaziu cu copiii in ritmul asta disciplinele importante cum este romana si matematica se fac separat jumatate de ora cu o clasa jumatate de ora cu cealalta abia daca apuc sa predau ca vine alt profesor peste tine cind sa mai verifici cunostinte cind sa mai transmiti macar la clasele primare mai sacrifici din discipline precum educatia fizica desenul sau muzica si poti face cu copiii socotit citire si scriere
3543385 la geografie profesorul e in curs de calificare iar daca va dori sa se intoarca dupa aceea la catedra tot la rosu va schimba raportul dintre cadrele didactice calificate si necalificate din zona
3543386 in colectiv se integreaza bine si se tine de program
3543387 nu mi a fost rusine sa i port mina unui tigan
3543388 principala mea satisfactie este sa vad ca elevii mei au un rost ca rezultatele lor sint bune este simplu sa va explic motivatia mea ca dascal prin citeva exemple
3543389 atit viorel cit si sora sa au terminat 8 clase m am chinuit sa ii indemn spre scoala pentru ca aveau o situatie mai deosebita acasa trebuiau sa lucreze cu ziua fata e gestionara la siraj acum isi cistiga singuri piinea iar mama lor mi a spus cit de mult a contat ca amindoi copiii ei sa termine macar opt clase
3543390 am suplinit o invatatoare intr un an care nu s a ocupat la fel de toti copiii mie nu mi a fost rusine sa i port mina unui tigan
3543391 sint profesoare tinerele care intirzie la ore si apoi in cancelarie tot ele sint primele pai cind au avut timp sa verifice cunostintele sa le predea sa ii evalueze pe copii
3543392 in sedintele publice odata cu noi participa si cadrele didactice calificate care au obtinut sub 5 la titularizare si au prioritate in fata noastra cu toate ca noi la testare poate luam note bune stau si ma intreb un profesor de nota 2 cu tot cu punctul din oficiu ce cunostinte poate sa le transmita copiilor
3543393 indiferent de hirtia pe care o ai daca nu reusesti sa comunici cu copilul el te simte sint oameni care nu au chemare pentru a fi dascali si sint oameni care atrag doar prin felul de a vorbi eu am invatat foarte mult de la profesorii mei care mi au fost modele
3543394 inspectiile care vin controleaza in special profesorii necalificati de aceea trebuie sa fiu la zi cu planurile de lectii dar nu am avut niciodata probleme
3543395 cu mirare am constatat ca orele aveau un continut corect stiintific chiar daca nu era foarte sofisticat practic doamna profesoara ii facea pe elevi sa invete pentru ca ea invata la rindul ei prin puterea exemplului a reusit sa obtina rezultate bune este un exemplu de respect pentru profesie
3543396 am facut liceul la iasi la vasile alecsandri pina in clasa a xii a pentru ca fratele meu nu ma mai putea sustine financiar din trimestrul al doilea cum era pe atunci m am transferat la liceul raducaneni unde am terminat sefa de promotie imi aduc aminte cum doamna profesoara de limba romana ghita francisca a spus atunci ca a pus primul 10 din cariera ei ceilalti elevi veneau sa ma cunoasca luasem 10 era ceva pe atunci nu erau elevi de 10 pe linie si sint convinsa ca nici acum nu exista elevi de 10 pe linie nu poti fi la fel de bun la toate dar din moment ce notele conteaza profesorii tind sa se lase induplecati
3543397 sigur ca as fi vrut sa devin cadru didactic calificat si posibilitatile materiale ar fi fost altele ultima oara am incercat acum citiva ani prin proiectul pentru invatamint rural cind am terminat toata documentatia am constatat ca nu indeplineam conditia de virsta trebuia sa am cel mult 50 de ani iar eu implinisem 52 nu am avut noroc niciodata cind am terminat eu liceul se desfiintasera scolile postliceale apoi am avut copiii iar cind au crescut am preferat sa cheltuiesc cu scoala lor la iasi doua dintre fetele mele au terminat liceul sanitar si lucreaza la iasi pe ambulanta si cealalta este educatoare dar acus termina si facultatea
3543398 actiunile ce vor intra in contul avas reprezinta gajul depus de mei pentru realizarea investitiilor prevazute in contractul de privatizare a fortus cum acele conditii nu au fost intrunite am decis luarea unor masuri ferme
3543399 in termen de cinci zile calitatea de actionar majoritar la fortus a avas urmeaza a fi inregistrata la registrul comertului si la toate celelalte institutiiale statului
3543400 intrucit o asemenea masura era prevazuta in contract doar in cazul unor disponibilizari de personal lucru care nu s a intimplat vom cere in instanta luarea acestei decizii
3543401 presupusa investitie de 1 2 milioane este dovedita prin niste acte dar practic ea nu se regaseste in totalitate in combinat
3543402 toate lucrarile de mediu realizate pina acum au fost realizate doar din fonduri obtinute din productia fortus
3543403 am cunoscut o pe monica serbanescu in calitatea de doctorand o persoana foarte muncitoare cu deosebit interes teza de doctorat in care a tratat mijloacele si formele de lupta impotriva crimei organizate respectiv activitatea organelor de urmarire penala a fost o lucrare completa pe care unii membri ai comisiei au considerat o drept cea mai buna lucrare la prezentarea careia au asistat vreodata
3543404 de obicei referatele se fac la vreo 30 40 de pagini ea le facea de fiecare data la vreo 100 120 de pagini intotdeauna a dat dovada de corectitudine si onestitate
3543405 dupa cite o cunosc cred ca ar face fata este competenta sa duca munca de procuror al dna
3543406 va fi cu siguranta foarte aglomerat daca va fi nevoie vom suplimenta numarul de ghisee la toate unitatile fiscale la nivelul municipiului iasi functioneaza deja sase iar in teritoriu cite unul la fiecare sediu
3543407 amenzile care ii pasc pe cei care nu vor depune raportarile contabile sunt destul de consistente fiind cuprinse intre 1 000 si 4 500 lei
3543408 intrucit datele sunt inca in stadiu de centralizare privitor la cei care nu au depus raportarile pe 2007 la nivel local au fost trimise circa 1 400 de notificari amenda urmind sa fie stabilita pentru fiecare caz in parte in urma unei discutii cu contribuabilul
3543409 nedepunerea sau depunerea cu intirziere a dosarului pe motivul unei deplasari in strainatate sau a decesului persoanei care trebuia sa efectueze depunerea va fi sanctionata cu amenda minima sau doar cu un avertisment altfel stau lucrurile de exemplu cu cei care recidiveaza
3543410 raportarilor li se anexeaza si un desfasurator al tranzactiilor inregistrate pe fiecare cont apartinind agentului economic
3543411 este vorba de debite inregistrate la sanatate n r contributii la casa de asigurari de sanatate nu stiu exact insa de cind dateaza
3543412 sc prisma serv sa iasi este debitor preluat de avas in baza oug 95 2003 prin protocolul de transfer de creanta nr 41 03 03 2004 semnat intre autoritate si casa de asigurari de sanatate iasi precizam ca pina la acest moment avas a intreprins toate masurile legale pentru recuperarea acestei datorii respectiv somatii succesive si blocari ale conturilor acestei societati fara a reusi insa recuperarea creantei din acest motiv avas a trecut la punerea sub sechestru a bunurilor societatii si la scoaterea acestora la vinzare prin licitatie publica

3543609 we and the mdc headed by mr mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is trying to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3543610 we are proceeding and mr mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3543611 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out
3543612 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that does not include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3543613 theyre going through all that as a team trying to figure out if favre or aaron rodgers was the man while weve got the same team we had all offseason im glad they got all that darn press cause when we go down there itll be the kids first start and his first damn loss

3543621 the team spirit on board was excellent and although the competition was fierce we fought right up to the end in the true spirit of racing
3543622 we look at the portfolio on a daily basis and were looking for the best stocks across the board if somethings not working its out
3543623 when youre not limited by region you can find the best candidates
3543624 were as sector neutral as possible too so we can be free to roam
3543625 warning survival rate 50 percent ride at your own risk
3543626 the following night the lord stood near paul and said take courage

3543628 well this trial is inconvenient but ill just keep quiet and ride it out until i get to rome then god and i will be back in business like usual

3543630 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3543631 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3543632 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3543633 what we should be talking about is food security not food
3543634 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3543635 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster
3543636 a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel god with us
3543637 you know they have the baby boom we have the construction boom
3543638 theres been a ton of construction which means limited workers
3543639 so you have to go out of state to get workers because the workers that are here are stretched every contracting contract is stretched to the limit
3543640 weve got union nonunion were hiring anybody that we can hire to get the jobs done and get it done correct
3543641 if anybody ever wanted to have a field of expertise construction is the place especially in morgantown now
3543642 this year we are paving 10 streets eight years ago we would have been able to pave 20 streets
3543643 it would have caused a big problem had we started paving streets in the last year or two but because we started years ago paving the really bad streets and long streets and wide streets got them out of the way
3543644 it may affect funding at the end of the year or next year but as far as what were doing this year we are committed to those projects and doing them this year
3543645 as a first time mother we werent really surprised to have that happen
3543646 we know that auroras proven herself as a really good mother and sure enough open up the gate aurora came out and bang she was right there with the calf had the calf by her side doing everything that a mother should have been doing
3543647 we saw her start to show some of the body movements and exhibiting behaviour that we hope that we see from her
3543648 the calf started getting kind of caught in a little bit of a tug of war between the mother and the grandmother
3543649 thats happened in a lot of human instances as well you see that going on
3543650 seeing that happen we decided it was time to move aurora back into our medical pool area to allow that relationship to develop since we saw that qila was definitely interested
3543651 with kind of a decrease in what we call contact calls between aurora and the calf we felt comfortable allowing aurora to come back into the habitat and continue on with the development of the calf in that way
3543652 so it was really interesting to see them kind of start to bond further last night
3543653 shes tried to nurse from aurora a couple of times
3543654 ive basically been studying how belugas learn their many different sounds
3543655 im monitoring the calfs vocal development basically how the calf learns to make all of the sounds that adult belugas make theyre extremely vocal animals
3543656 shes making all the sounds that are typical of beluga calves
3543657 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3543658 we will make sure there is a free flow of goods people and expression during the 2010 olympic games
3543659 i think we are already seeing some improvements i think we will see more
3543660 i think people who come from outside vancouver will see communities striving to be even better there will be significant improvements
3543661 i believe we are making some significant steps to improve the lives of those in the downtown eastside
3543662 i dont see this as an area of problems i see this as an area of possibilities
3543663 ive got three domestic reporters who are asking all the questions
3543664 were dealing with it because we think its important to make it a healthier community to live in were dealing with literally thousands of citizens who have significant challenges in their lives
3543665 its not something that can be done quickly if it was it would have been solved across the country and around the world
3543666 just as beijing has rolled out the red carpet so will vancouver in 2010 welcome the world
3543667 we expect to be opening the doors in a way that will be unprecedented in our history
3543668 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3543669 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment

3543700 this is actually really interesting this month by my count we have 11 advisories covering 26 vulnerabilities
3543701 there were originally supposed to be 12 advisories but it appears as though the windows media player update was pulled since this was originally marked critical its not good that its pulled
3543702 its like a being given a treasure map thats half completed theres still a lot of space to cover but its significantly smaller than if you had no insight at all
3543703 also four of the 12 advisories had vulnerabilities that had already been publicly disclosed and one half of those publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are already being actively exploited
3543704 looks like summer vacation is over a little early for network security professionals after a light july the august patch tuesday will be a very busy one
3543705 the critical updates will affect both desktops and servers so it departments will need to quickly and carefully assess which patches should receive priority
3543706 the five critical patches need to get installed as soon as possible this month
3543707 all of these patches can affect client by attack vectors that are used in day to day client side computer use visiting an evil web site or by opening an evil document
3543708 continuing the ongoing trend attackers are increasingly targeting common users and tricking them into accessing a malicious web site or opening an unsolicited document
3543709 todays bulletins mostly deal with user driven applications such microsoft office including word excel powerpoint access and others such as internet explorer outlook express and windows messenger this is something people need to be aware of and prioritize more sooner than later
3543710 mccain wouldnt have been our person but we definitely feel like it would be a huge help to john mccain to pick someone we can be confident will represent the value voter position i dont think it helps him mccain at all in ohio if he picks romney
3543711 i think a lot of people even in traditional republican strongholds like many regions of virginia are ready for a change they are recognizing the bankruptcy of the two major parties
3543712 the two major parties clearly are nothing more than sides of the same coin
3543713 the year long prelude to the beijing games has seen a major crackdown on free speech and dissent a massive sweep of undesirables from the host city and increasing abuses of ethnic minority tibetans and uighurs
3543714 i would put china in the top 10 percent of all the authoritarian states in the world
3543715 every country in the world oil states excepted with gdppc topping 8 000 was at least partly free as categorized by the human rights group freedom house indeed all ranked as free except the tiny island city state of singapore
3543716 classed as belonging to the free nations of the earth
3543717 and im not really one to gossip so i dont like all that hoo ha
3543718 but from an artists perspective it doesnt really put any pressure on me whatsoever
3543719 life goes on so who gives a fuck albums are albums and theyre either significant or theyre not for me being in van she its not significant we do what we do and were totally different so theres not really any pressure
3543720 even though what he had done was different to what we were doing we butted heads for the first few weeks but we went into the kinks ray davies studio konk and just recorded by the end of it we were best mates
3543721 and because we took such a long time to get it out and do it right its really diverse
3543722 we wrote a bunch of songs over a three year period where over six months wed be into psychedelic stuff like pink floyd and quite cinematic soundtracks then wed get into poppy french house period and then quite a grungy period listening to my bloody valentine
3543723 the album title v stands for video because most of the songs and some of the track titles reference movies directly
3543724 a song like virgin suicides is a direct reference to the movie by sofia coppola its such a great movie and had such a great feel to it
3543725 i grew up watching movies i dont have a tv connection so ill rent seven movies a week and thats my visual staple and ive done that for the last five years of my life a lot of what we as a band first connected on was music in movies
3543726 paper ballots provide a way the electronic totals from a ballot scanner can be independently confirmed
3543727 these can and should be hand counted as a check against the electronic tallying device
3543728 the reality is that historically elections have been conducted on paper and throughout the same history weve had election fraud
3543729 the single biggest change we will see in future voting systems is that they will have end to end verifiability

3543731 we are hoping that people will feel an emotion in response to the robot and that this will inspire them to find out more about robotics
3543732 the business of theology is to make sure that our questions to the scriptures of any religious tradition will be directed in such a way as to allow ourselves to be challenged and even shaken at the deepest levels of our existence by what the text says
3543733 for even the man of my peace in whom i trusted who ate my bread hath lifted up his heel against me
3543734 the wounds of a friend are more to be trusted that the spontaneous kisses of an enemy
3543735 then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to that and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me
3543736 ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified
3543737 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3543738 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3543739 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3543740 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3543741 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3543742 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3543743 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3543744 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3543745 when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3543746 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3543747 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3543748 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3543749 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3543750 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3543751 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3543752 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3543753 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3543754 we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3543755 i wish that i had followed it with all my heart

3543758 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
3543759 i think all chinas viewers and listeners should understand that was a matter of national interest

3543762 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3543770 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3543771 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3543772 the cheapest car to run is the car you already own
3543773 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3543774 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3543775 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3543776 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3543777 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3543778 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3543779 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3543780 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3543781 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3543782 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets

3543792 its not a question of people who are already overweight becoming clumsy because the majority of these children werent any heavier than their peers
3543793 it was assumed that all the neurological complications associated with obesity were consequences of obesity itself this suggests thats not the case
3543794 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3543795 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3543796 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3543797 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3543798 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3543799 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3543800 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief

3543809 theyre only as daring as their target demographic allows them to be
3543810 its a lot harder to be bold and daring when youre designing something for a more middle class larger group of people i see it all the time at school someone designs something ridiculously expensive and their target market board is filled with shots of young incredibly rich people cut out from magazines
3543811 long before these crowded streets here stood my dreaming tree
3543812 these classic novels have introduced several generations of children to the greatest characters in literature oliver twist long john silver dartagnan quasimodo and hamlet to name just a few and have fuelled their desire to read the original works
3543813 at a time when we see children reading less and our literacy rates are a great worry the graphic novel has the potential to get reluctant readers engaged in these wonderful stories we can see these being widely supported in schools as well and we have added new material to stretch the reader with discussion topics and a timeline of what was happening in the world when the book was first published

3543816 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3543817 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3543818 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3543819 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3543820 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3543821 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3543822 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3543823 the bank advises that it has made this decision after its board assessed the current economic climate the uncertainty in world financial markets and the risks involved in integrating these complex businesses at this time

3543826 we australia do stand to render any assistance if that will help in terms of ceasefire and also in terms of humanitarian assistance because we do have regrettably very many displaced people
3543827 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front
3543828 there are indications that georgia asked a range of nation states including australia to consider military assistance
3543829 australia indicated at officials levels that we werent interested in providing military assistance
3543830 would it be wrong ask people to pray for rain of biblical proportions

3543834 global demand for our plasma therapies continues as we enter new markets develop new therapies and find new indications for existing therapies
3543835 our neighbour thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3543836 everyone knows the next one could be ukraine and then poland all of europe should be here now
3543837 we cannot rule out a firearm 100 per cent we will know that today after the post mortem but the pathologist is confident that there was no firearm used
3543838 we need information from the public particularly those that live in and around the house
3543839 we would also like to hear from anyone that may know who these offenders are or what the motive for the attack may be
3543840 hes a good 14 year old boy from a good family the family is devastated and no family would ever want to go through what this family is going through at the moment
3543841 i am anxious that we may be facing another situation where an innocent person is the victim of a violent crime
3543842 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3543843 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk
3543844 by any measure the residents of weymouth constantly make every effort to ensure that their neighbourhood is safe
3543845 notwithstanding the worrying prospect of the outcome of last nights incident weymouth will remain a great place to live both now and in the future
3543846 some people suggest that the remuneration arrangements within financial institutions need to be redesigned
3543847 the concern here is that current arrangements encourage short termism with the risk metrics used in the remuneration process paying too little attention to risks that are likely to crystallise only in the medium term
3543848 increasing capital buffers in the good times is likely to reduce the need for banks to raise capital when times are tough
3543849 this might help smooth out some of the swings in the lending cycle
3543850 an increase in capital could be achieved by banks retaining on their balance sheet a slightly higher share of their profits in good times when credit losses are unusually low rather than paying the profits to shareholders in the form of dividends
3543851 as the recent experience with conduits sivs special investment vehicles and 364 day credit lines cautions the result paradoxically can be an increase in overall risk in the financial system
3543852 there are also considerable implementation challenges facing any attempt by regulators to introduce a regime in which minimum capital requirements change over the course of a business or financial cycle
3543853 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is
3543854 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3543855 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3543856 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3543857 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3543858 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3543859 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3543860 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3543861 my favorite was just filming the last jump in a section

3543864 isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites as it is written
3543865 these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me a 8 you have let go of the commands of god and are holding on to the traditions of men
3543866 you have a fine way of setting aside the commands of god in order to observe 10for moses said honor your father and your mother c and anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death d 11 but you say that if a man says to his father or mother whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is corban that is a gift devoted to god 12 then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother 13 thus you nullify the word of god by your tradition that you have handed down and you do many things like that
3543867 dont you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him unclean 19 for it doesnt go into his heart but into his stomach and then out of his body

3543875 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3543876 it might be once in a century you see something like this

3543878 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down

3543883 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race

3543885 fire eagle is a way for people to take their location to the web
3543886 essentially fire eagle is nothing more nothing less than a store for a users location
3543887 whats more interesting is how it works as a switchboard
3543888 fire eagle solved all the hard problems with location for us
3543889 it makes it easier for bloggers to have correct location information on their blog within their posts being able to geo tag their content
3543890 obviously fire eagle is crucial to the success of what were trying to do
3543891 there are other tools that identify location but none that do it in specifically this way
3543892 the attention to privacy is noteworthy as is the concept behind fire eagle the challenge will be to build user awareness and adoption in the near term
3543893 boeing fears that the bush administration has made up its mind on what tanker it wants and so all of these meetings will have no real bearing on the outcome of the competition
3543894 we hope that it was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades
3543895 we dont want to buy things that say made in iraq we want things that are made in china

3543903 praised the israel defense forces for its role in training georgian troops and said israel should be proud of its military might in an interview with army radio israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers yakobashvili told army radio in hebrew referring to a private israeli group georgia had hired
3543904 a georgian military plant in which israeli experts are upgrading jet fighters for the georgian military russian fighter jets bombed runways inside the plant located near tbilisi where israeli security firm elbit is in charge of upgrading georgian su 25 jets
3543905 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
3543906 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military
3543907 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran
3543908 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
3543909 we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee everyones body reacts differently i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3543910 all im doing every day is looking forward to my next day
3543911 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3543912 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3543913 i can say its gonna be unlike anything else thats on fox and maybe on cable
3543914 organization however is believed to act only as a carrier for criminal activities online it may not be possible to determine who is ultimately responsible
3543915 its a nice trade for everybody the criminals get a little protection the russian government gets to have something happen without having their fingerprints on it thats the assumption like estonia we dont have links to the russian government but its not a fluke where we magically have this happen when a shooting war starts
3543916 this looks to me like more than just some grassroots hacktivist inspired attacks
3543917 but at the same time theres no way to link it to a state sponsored type of attack its somewhere in the middle it certainly has criminal elements
3543918 we are witnessing in this crisis the birth of true operational cyber warfare
3543919 the use of cyber attack assets in conjunction with kinetic military operations in the current crisis now stands among the most significant developments ever seen in the field of information security or cyber conflict studies

3543934 shit if i dont ever get my own show im gonna have to be a piano teacher and thatd be shit
3543935 in four of the debates i have expressly disclaimed all intention to bring about social and political equality between the white and black races and in all the rest i have done the same thing by clear implication
3543936 i have made it equally plain that i think the negro is included in the word men used in the declaration of independence
3543937 all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights
3543938 in its very first sentence the constitution points to the declaration the constitution is established in order to secure the blessings of liberty and what is a blessing other than a gift from god
3543939 reason is no less the voice of god than sacred scripture
3543940 i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races there is a physical difference between the two which in my judgment will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality
3543941 there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence

3543950 now that this issue has been resolved i look forward to moving this case forward
3543951 im sorry that the defense has filed motions which only serve to delay the case in fact there has not been a rush to justice in this case the fontana family has endured lengthy delays and been denied their day in court
3543952 while we respect the courts decision we continue to believe that lane liroff and his office has a conflict of interest such they cannot be fair and even handed in their treatment of deshawn campbell because they continue to unconstituionally seek the death penalty against a man who is mentally retarded
3543953 if this agreement holds a big if its a better outcome than i would have expected georgias democratic government will remain in place despite russias previous determination to overthrow it the russians will not have destroyed georgias oil pipeline to europe the most important pipeline in the region that doesnt pass through russian or iranian territory and russia will renounce future use of force against georgia and reduce its forces in the secessionist regions of abkhazia and south ossetia to their prewar levels i am skeptical that the russians will fully respect the last two commitments nonetheless the outcome could have been far worse why did russia accept an arrangement that falls so far short of their maximum objectives

3544002 the three screen spot covers all of our business technologies
3544003 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go thats a hundred times better than watching on tv
3544004 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it make sure i was well prepared but i do not want to sit there watching it wondering what could have happened
3544005 it gives me a mental lift to have got this far because to be honest if they had told me the bleakest medical diagnosis which came out in dribs and drabs in the end i might have said this is not going to happen
3544006 and there were times in the last 12 weeks when i thought how can this be happening has someone put a jinx on me
3544007 but then id go to bed and think no this is the olympics im not going to give up
3544008 and gary lough her husband and coach said to me someone is testing you to see how much you want it
3544009 it certainly means i have a lot of unfinished business with the olympics but i also think the olympics are something more special anyway
3544010 it was my dream as a little girl you dont dream about world championships you dream about the olympics
3544011 but regardless of what happened four years ago this still would have been something i fought for
3544012 i have not taken stupid risks with my leg but at every point i
3544013 you have to ask yourself are you prepared for the worst thing that can happen and for me the worst thing is not to be able to finish the race and i have already faced that in athens
3544014 there have been points when i really did not think i would make it so i will be the happiest of all the runners on the start line
3544015 the only reason i would not able to finish it would be if my leg could not handle it but i have been encouraged as my leg has been coping with good amounts of running

3544036 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3544037 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3544038 a lot of people have a reluctance to buy produce when they cant identify where it comes from or if it was handled properly throughout the process
3544039 a lot of people feel that if you can shake the hand of the farmer who grows your food you can be surer of its safety
3544040 theres no greater love than to show people what you know
3544041 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3544042 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3544043 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3544044 i havent said much about the tight end position but they are all doing well we have six players in the mix right now michael palmer is the starter but kasey nobles has also had a good camp that position is important in our offense and we play a lot of tight ends it is not the glamour position like quarterback running back and receiver where we have a lot of high profile players
3544045 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3544046 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3544047 as more government services move toward the internet you end up with more exposure to these types of attack whether it was an organization and executed by government or criminal elements acting at somebodys direction
3544048 its hard to prove it was a government directed operation
3544049 it looks like it was coming from russia or is it a co opted server that wasnt properly patched with people taking over the computer and doing things with it
3544050 with the russian business network you can rent out a server or a botnet for a number of hours you pay your cyber gold and these transactions happen offshore thats one of the challenges that governments face
3544051 its a brute force attack one that goes all the way back to the mafiaboy attacks of 2000
3544052 this is not a verifiable cyber war but it is clearly a step in that direction
3544053 he has taken extremely good care of my daughter who has been sick
3544054 he wouldnt do anything that he thought was wrong deliberately
3544055 it is abhorrent to think someone is specifically out there on the internet looking for young girls
3544056 i have serious doubts whether wayne is capable of hurting or molesting a child or an adult
3544057 i just dont see the justice in sending a 46 year old retarded adult to prison for talking dirty on the internet
3544058 what it gets down to is considering all the conduct
3544059 i cannot get around the language you used in communicating with who you thought was a 13 year old
3544060 regardless of what your iq is you did this intentionally
3544061 your goal here was to have sex with a 13 year old girl
3544062 there is never going to be a point in time when society is going to say this is ok

3544067 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3544068 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3544069 there are half a dozen different locations where the pot growers are dumping equipment and soil and its not just regular potting soil its laced with chemicals and pesticides they dumpers have to use rubber gloves to handle it and then they leave the gloves behind
3544070 not only does this stuff look bad it is not a healthy thing for the wild animals in the area they can get injured by this stuff
3544071 este a o es para aprender y el a o que viene quiero el t tulo
3544072 pero siempre hab a otra verdad detr s de la verdad
3544073 one person got the back legs and the biggest guy on our team got the body
3544074 after our first year 2006 was such a success my phone rang off the hook from other fairs we all want to fill the grandstand
3544075 the immediate reaction from someone may be oh my god theyre hurting that pig thats not true
3544076 pigs squeal when theyre fed pigs squeal in the mud not because theyre hurt you have to educate your audience about swine
3544077 has the inside of their mouth hosed out so that theyre not swallowing mud
3544078 its incredibly frightening for these animals to have excited people chasing them around grabbing them dragging them and falling on them
3544079 the reality is that we dont need to use animals to entertain ourselves if we want to get down and dirty we can have mud wrestling contests or greased pole contests or something where animals are not victims whether we intend for them to be or not
3544080 you pretty much have to have someone stop the pig first then the other two people can help put it in the barrel
3544081 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3544082 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3544083 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3544084 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3544085 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3544086 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3544087 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3544088 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3544089 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3544090 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3544091 because i got more inspiration i got more sadness in me
3544092 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3544093 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3544094 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3544095 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3544096 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3544097 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3544098 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened

3544143 we look around and lo and behold our irrigation pipe was gone
3544144 we cant quit farming weve gotta have water here to water our sod crop
3544145 you lose the money for the pipe but you lose revenue for not being able to get out into the field and do your harvesting
3544146 every one of these joints of pipe had to be manually disconnected with a six inch clamp that you actually have to pull apart raise the pipe up and pull the clamp out pull these pipes apart
3544147 they took 500 feet and they had to tote each piece to the trailer
3544148 if youre hungry your kids are hungry or something dont steal our irrigation pipes come ask me and ill give you the money

3544152 i try to make a point to put a soul in there because every person does have a reason why they are the way they are

3544369 i am deeply honoured to be recognized by my peers but far more importantly i view this award as an important acknowledgement by the profession that ed overcrowding is indeed a significant and serious public health threat that undermines the confidence of canadians in the integrity of their health care system

3544373 i enjoy the work i do and simply wanted to be an advocate for the patients and ed staff and make a contribution that would change the ed environment

3544489 i am in the process of quitting paxil right now i took 20 mg for about 2 years and decided it was time to come off the damn stuff like most i felt like i was living half a life with no real interest in anything i am a past athlete and have returned to a fairly regular exercise program a week ago one day after coming off the drug and maybe that has something to do with the way i am feeling right now while i am experiencing many of the intense negative symptoms of withdrawal the whoosh nausea hallucinations dissassociation esceptionally intense dreams problems sleeping etc the weirdest thing is despite all that how fabulous i feel all the physical misery of the withdrawal symptoms j ust doesnt compare to being able to feel again emphasis mine ed i cant believe what a wuss i have been over the last two years and how focused i am right now i am even enjoying the feelings of intense anger and the technicolor dreams im a writer so maybe this is all grist for my mill or maybe im some kind of oddball but wow i feel like i can do anything well maybe except eat

3544496 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3544497 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3544498 im always amused by comments on this blog suggesting that im biased against microsoft

3544502 were not saying the hog industry needs to disappear from north carolina its an important part of our economy
3544503 but theres no reason we should continue to pollute rivers streams creeks and lakes and let it impact human health
3544504 they work particularly well in ongoing pain states where the nervous system becomes hypersensitive so even the lightest touch becomes painful
3544505 chemicals in mint oil and cooling the skin can activate these painkilling nerves but neither traditional method is very specific
3544506 we have shown that the trtm8 receptor is the critical molecular target for this pain killing effect
3544507 some types of chronic pain especially following nerve injury are resistant to morphine
3544508 these compounds act powerfully as pain killers on many types of chronic pain including nerve injury pain
3544509 they seem to be just as powerful as morphine but work through an entirely separate mechanism with what we think will be less side effects
3544510 the findings appear in an august issue of the journal current biology
3544511 the bank advises that it has made this decision after its board assessed the current economic climate the uncertainty in world financial markets and the risks involved in integrating these complex businesses at this time
3544512 the bank believes that given these factors it would not be in the best interests of shareholders to proceed with the acquisition in this environment
3544513 some people suggest that the remuneration arrangements within financial institutions need to be redesigned
3544514 the concern here is that current arrangements encourage short termism with the risk metrics used in the remuneration process paying too little attention to risks that are likely to crystallise only in the medium term
3544515 increasing capital buffers in the good times is likely to reduce the need for banks to raise capital when times are tough
3544516 this might help smooth out some of the swings in the lending cycle
3544517 an increase in capital could be achieved by banks retaining on their balance sheet a slightly higher share of their profits in good times when credit losses are unusually low rather than paying the profits to shareholders in the form of dividends
3544518 as the recent experience with conduits sivs special investment vehicles and 364 day credit lines cautions the result paradoxically can be an increase in overall risk in the financial system
3544519 there are also considerable implementation challenges facing any attempt by regulators to introduce a regime in which minimum capital requirements change over the course of a business or financial cycle
3544520 the company continues to target long term growth in management eps of 20 per cent per year to be achieved by a combination of organic growth and acquisitions as well as balance sheet management
3544521 looking to fiscal 2009 and having regard to current equity foreign exchange and interest rate market conditions we expect management eps to be approximately 10 per cent higher than fiscal 2008
3544522 the outcome was very pleasing in the light of financial market turmoil that resulted in slowing initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activity and substantial falls in northern hemisphere interest rates
3544523 the group has however witnessed increased activity in the capital reorganisation arena with a number of large rights issues and dividend reinvestment plans undertaken or announced
3544524 we continue to anticipate stable market conditions for our plasma therapies business and growing contribution from royalties associated with the international sales of gardasil
3544525 the acquisition will make csl a stronger competitor in the highly competitive plasma therapeutics market place
3544526 the goal of a criminal investigation is to establish responsibility if there is of each and every one involved which is not the goal of a public inquiry
3544527 the investigation will be complete will be impartial it will be a fair investigation
3544528 the ideology of hollywood movies is that you can take on eight people with martial arts courses and that everyone can be neutralized just like that its not that easy
3544529 the advantage of a public inquiry is that it will look for the motives that feed this hatred of the police system
3544530 the other advantage of a public inquiry is that we will be able to analyze the intervention methods of police
3544531 they are well inclined to keep a peaceful atmosphere to keep an open communication with the communities and the population should have confidence in the police department
3544532 this is not only about gang street members its about ordinary citizens who live peacefully in montreal north
3544533 whenever police see a black man or just see a young man police will stop him and try to get information from them and arrest them

3544553 we australia do stand to render any assistance if that will help in terms of ceasefire and also in terms of humanitarian assistance because we do have regrettably very many displaced people
3544554 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front
3544555 there are indications that georgia asked a range of nation states including australia to consider military assistance

3544558 we cannot rule out a firearm 100 per cent we will know that today after the post mortem but the pathologist is confident that there was no firearm used
3544559 we need information from the public particularly those that live in and around the house
3544560 we would also like to hear from anyone that may know who these offenders are or what the motive for the attack may be
3544561 hes a good 14 year old boy from a good family the family is devastated and no family would ever want to go through what this family is going through at the moment
3544562 i am anxious that we may be facing another situation where an innocent person is the victim of a violent crime
3544563 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3544564 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk
3544565 by any measure the residents of weymouth constantly make every effort to ensure that their neighbourhood is safe
3544566 notwithstanding the worrying prospect of the outcome of last nights incident weymouth will remain a great place to live both now and in the future
3544567 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3544568 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3544569 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3544570 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3544571 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3544572 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3544573 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence

3544585 obviously the changes that have taken place in management at elders have meant weve had to re engage with and work with them because were partners in this venture we are working with them and hope to be able to announce very shortly our next step

3544588 we are consistently acquiring mobile wireless and broadband customers and keeping overall margin stable
3544589 wireless broadband continues to bolster mobile growth across the industry and optuss result is no exception with almost 70 per cent of optus post paid subscriber growth driven by this new product segment
3544590 all up a solid result the move away from wholesaling telstra services has also helped margins in the consumer division and compensated for a significant bad debt in the mobile division
3544591 we registered our interest when they tried to sell the business late last year
3544592 we did the same earlier this year and we continue to follow it but weve not yet had an engagement with them i continue to this day to be dismayed
3544593 from our perspective we are always on the look out for small bolt on acquisitions
3544594 we would have been interested in that kind of business

3544598 i think perhaps she wanted to gauge how serious the whole thing was as if she still wasnt quite sure of it or me so i put on a grim expression and went through the flat in what i hoped was a clint eastwoody sort of way pushing open doors with my foot opening cupboards suddenly while she stood in the corridor her cheeks spotted with red
3544599 hey everyone look at me my spine is twisted and its forcing me to walk around like a toddler
3544600 we have got three businesses that are profitable and one that isnt capital markets is loss making because it hasnt got much in by way of revenues because the capital markets are shut we have to accept that this is a hugely cyclical business and when it disappears it disappears completely
3544601 if we get to a point where vendors are prepared to say a price that institutions believe is attractive markets could open again
3544602 im quite pessimistic but we are running the business so it can survive and prosper it is still profitable its cash generative and there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet
3544603 this is the worst financial crisis that anyone alive has seen
3544604 the opportunities are there but there is a certain nervousness among corporates to stick their heads above the parapet
3544605 avoid using null on string based fields such as charfield and
3544606 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3544607 i sometimes think that being widowed is gods way of telling you to come off the pill
3544608 no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body no woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother
3544609 the pill to a great degree made possible the hetero sexual revolution yet those who developed oral contraceptives did not intend to promote what the majority of americans at the time called promiscuity
3544610 the freedom that women were supposed to have found in the sixties largely boiled down to easy contraception and abortion things to make life easier for men in fact
3544611 i think he realises we werent too far away from them when they were playing at the very top of their game
3544612 with the injuries and stuff that has been going on at our place we as players can all raise the bar a little bit and with it being that close with us missing out by two points on the premiership and in the champions league final i think they know that every year were going to give them a right good run for their money
3544613 it still hurts me to see pictures of united lifting the trophy at wigan last season we made that trophy ours when jose mourinho first took over we want it back and thats what were aiming for
3544614 frank and didier know now theyre at chelsea and weve got to make it happen this year
3544615 hopefully things can get resolved with frank with the contract as hes been our best player for the last four of five years and we want to keep him
3544616 scolaris a very experienced man like ferguson and knows exactly what hes doing im sure the managers got a few tricks up his sleeve along the way hes a quiet man and doesnt want to get involved in the mind games and hopefully we can stop him getting involved by taking an early lead in the premiership and leading the way
3544617 ive been awfully lucky to get the armband in the past and those memories will stay with me forever but its one man making the big decision hes taken his time and hell make the right decision whoever he chooses ill fully respect if its not me ill walk up to the person shake their hand and wish them well england can move on from that point
3544618 i dont have much choice its a young one or a younger one it is always a bit tricky when you have players come back for pre season so late
3544619 you try to rush the fitness when you have champions league qualifiers and some of them get injuries thats what has happened with cesc who only returned on july 29 from the european championship its the most problematic start to a season numbers wise we are short of one player and i hope to do something this week or before the transfer deadline
3544620 i would have said exactly the reverse you arent going to attract anyone by cheeseparing on the salary
3544621 if i had tried to describe the person i wanted i would have described steve he has absolutely the right experience
3544622 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3544623 he is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club this is a guy who loves city
3544624 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years he wants to build a dynasty and he was disappointed that people think he wanted to get in and back out
3544625 these homes are not fit for anyone to live in
3544626 in the brush in the middle of nowhere on a dead end road
3544627 weve known for a while they were a little strange that they didnt want interference from the outside world but unless were down there on a call its not part of our routine patrol
3544628 jail is inappropriate for these folks but to go untreated is not the answer either
3544629 its not a question of people who are already overweight becoming clumsy because the majority of these children werent any heavier than their peers
3544630 it was assumed that all the neurological complications associated with obesity were consequences of obesity itself this suggests thats not the case
3544631 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3544632 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3544633 well if you call us when you get to the parking lot we can send someone down to help you bring it inside

3544642 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3544643 the cruises are not intended to look for energy resources that is not a primary or even a secondary objective
3544644 however its inevitable because there are so few data in this area of the arctic there will be great interest in using this data
3544645 ultimately what is going to be needed is a more comprehensive ecological study of that region and some indication as to whether or not any technology that we have today is likely to be able to clean up spilled oil in that set of conditions

3544680 saya mengapresiasi kalau mui mau mengeluarkan fatwa haram merokok yang berdampak terhadap perlindungan anak anak di indonesia karena selama batas makruh berarti jika dikerjakan mendapat cela jika tidak dikerjakan tidak apa apa padahal dari segi kesehatan lebih banyak negatifnya
3544681 walaupun mungkin tidak terlalu signifikan tetapi sebagai isu massal akan menunjukkan kepada masyarakat oo ternyata mui memiliki sudut pandang yang cukup menarik dan bagus apalagi kerangkanya meminimilisir perokok kesannya kan kalau fatwa itu biasanya memberi histeria massal

3544698 a duopoly characterised by high gdp per capita of us 43 859 for 2007 an extremely high reported rate of mobile penetration at 166 4 rapidly growing internet user penetration at 44 7 and steady fixed line penetration at 30
3544699 given the already very high penetration rates in the uae we expect penetration rates to grow modestly from 166 per cent in 2007 to 188 per cent by 2012
3544700 penetration jumped over 38 in 2007 from 127 in 2006 to 166 in 2007 that is impressive growth for any market let alone one that already has penetration over 100 at face value these rates imply that there are nearly two sim cards per person in the uae

3544708 he would not have planted the sniffer but for the threat and his sentence was based on that

3544710 the only thing the magistrate said she wanted was to stay away from the two officers

3544716 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3544717 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3544718 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3544719 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionary speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3544720 and if there is any pressure at all it would be toward relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3544721 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

3544785 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3544786 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3544787 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3544788 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3544789 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3544790 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3544791 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3544792 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3544793 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3544794 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3544795 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3544796 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3544797 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3544798 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3544834 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty yet they have no choice but to plead out
3544835 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number
3544836 as a citizen i want our judges to administer justice not a federal agency when the executive branch forces the hand of the judiciary the result is abuse of power and arbitrariness unworthy of a democracy founded upon the constitutional principle of checks and balances

3544940 we have to think about affirmative action and craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
3544941 people would applaud a change of affirmative action from a race based to class based one or perhaps a melding of the two
3544942 amusingly enough its the thing that brings rednecks and african americans together were all becoming increasingly disenfranchised because of our class status
3544943 this isnt about dissecting people putting them in categories this society is not equal on a number of fronts
3544944 were focused on keeping the doors for opportunity open then well have the ability to invent more programs as we feel the need
3544945 this agreement has been agreed to by both presidents saakashvili and also medvedev the russian president
3544946 these are temporary arrangements now but later it should be replaced by international process
3544947 this does set the scene for a ceasefire although we do know that there is still sporadic fighting going on
3544948 but the scene is there now for an effective ceasefire we welcome very much the good work of the european union led by the french president president sarkozy and also the good work of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe
3544949 we have credible reports of camps set up in vladikavkaz where people have heard of outside killings and of executions of innocent civilians there

3544954 the price boom of the last five years may well have passed into history but so far the effect of its demise is to slow the number of transactions rather than cause a drop in prices
3544955 especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion this has to change
3544956 she is already well on her way to becoming a star thanks to her heart warming performance
3544957 it was the image of our national music our national culture and especially since it accompanied the arrival of the national flag in the arena this was an extremely serious matter
3544958 when lin miaoke was singing on friday she may not have realised that was not her own voice
3544959 mostly an animated three dimensional video that was made over a year it was not actually live footage except the final stage
3544960 looking at it from today the video was a bit brighter than the real fireworks
3544961 but most viewers thought it was live so we succeeded in the effect we had wanted
3544962 its just a fair chance well be able to reel him in
3544963 the under armour is a newcomer as far as the national stage
3544964 it will have most of the top high school kids for next years draft its really the best of the best for one spot
3544965 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3544966 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3544967 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3544968 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3544969 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3544970 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3544971 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3544972 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3544973 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3544974 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3544975 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3544976 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3544977 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3544978 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3544979 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3544980 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3544981 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3544982 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3544983 who are open to doing something on the production side
3544984 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3544985 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3544986 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3544987 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3544988 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3544989 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3544990 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3544991 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3544992 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3544993 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3544994 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3544995 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3544996 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3544997 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3544998 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3544999 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3545000 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3545001 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3545002 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3545003 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3545004 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3545005 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3545006 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3545007 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3545008 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3545009 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3545010 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3545011 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3545012 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3545013 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3545014 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3545015 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3545016 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3545017 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3545018 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3545019 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3545020 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3545021 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3545022 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3545023 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3545024 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3545025 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3545026 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3545027 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3545028 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3545029 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3545030 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3545031 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3545032 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3545033 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3545034 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3545035 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3545036 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3545037 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3545038 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3545039 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3545040 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3545041 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3545042 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3545043 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3545044 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3545045 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3545046 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3545047 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3545048 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3545049 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3545050 the company continues to target long term growth in management eps of 20 per cent per year to be achieved by a combination of organic growth and acquisitions as well as balance sheet management
3545051 looking to fiscal 2009 and having regard to current equity foreign exchange and interest rate market conditions we expect management eps to be approximately 10 per cent higher than fiscal 2008
3545052 the outcome was very pleasing in the light of financial market turmoil that resulted in slowing initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activity and substantial falls in northern hemisphere interest rates
3545053 the group has however witnessed increased activity in the capital reorganisation arena with a number of large rights issues and dividend reinvestment plans undertaken or announced
3545054 looking to fiscal 2009 conditions remain challenging but we expect earnings growth for the sixth consecutive year

3545230 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain

3545233 this creates questions about where we are heading i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup

3545270 this is actually really interesting this month by my count we have 11 advisories covering 26 vulnerabilities
3545271 there were originally supposed to be 12 advisories but it appears as though the windows media player update was pulled since this was originally marked critical its not good that its pulled
3545272 its like a being given a treasure map thats half completed theres still a lot of space to cover but its significantly smaller than if you had no insight at all
3545273 also four of the 12 advisories had vulnerabilities that had already been publicly disclosed and one half of those publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are already being actively exploited
3545274 looks like summer vacation is over a little early for network security professionals after a light july the august patch tuesday will be a very busy one
3545275 the critical updates will affect both desktops and servers so it departments will need to quickly and carefully assess which patches should receive priority
3545276 the five critical patches need to get installed as soon as possible this month
3545277 all of these patches can affect client by attack vectors that are used in day to day client side computer use visiting an evil web site or by opening an evil document
3545278 continuing the ongoing trend attackers are increasingly targeting common users and tricking them into accessing a malicious web site or opening an unsolicited document
3545279 todays bulletins mostly deal with user driven applications such microsoft office including word excel powerpoint access and others such as internet explorer outlook express and windows messenger this is something people need to be aware of and prioritize more sooner than later

3545283 there are services and programs available that many people dont know about or are unaware of
3545284 we point people to resources and i can help people do research but i cannot provide legal advice
3545285 the public library does contain circulating copies of many of these materials

3545287 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3545288 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3545289 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3545290 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3545291 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3545292 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3545293 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3545294 although my cancer treatment the surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy has finished i still need medication
3545295 as a result of my cancer im now on three different drugs they cost me about 44 a month that may not sound much to some but im struggling financially
3545296 im now on statutory sick pay because ive been too unwell to work my income is 360 per month and quite frankly i have barely enough money to live on
3545297 i budget for everything i dont go out because i cant afford to socialise i cant even invite friends over for a meal because i cant afford the food
3545298 i dont eat breakfast or lunch the meals i do buy are ones that are on special offer
3545299 i cant afford fresh fruit or meat i know that isnt healthy but i simply cant afford to buy healthy food
3545300 i have stayed awake at night for hours crying thinking how can i make this work
3545301 fighting cancer is hard enough without the terrible financial worry that comes with it
3545302 i feel penalised because i have a disease that the government doesnt consider should make me exempt from prescription charges
3545303 we read the cut amp run report to them because theyre trying to avoid it
3545304 but they cant hide ken strassner cant hide from his companys legacy of boreal destruction
3545305 the amount of old growth in the forest is projected to decline by as much as 50 percent in coming years due to logging that has already been done
3545306 the cut amp run report is a case study of kcs mismanagement due to the fact that they dont have a forest policy that protects forests
3545307 appetite for destruction not only leads to devastation of forests however it also leads to caribou and wolverine habitat loss human rights violations and labor conflicts if the company wants to keep portraying itself as a responsible corporate citizen they must quit trying to hide from the reality of what theyre doing to the kenogami forest
3545308 i cant say i have ever had a challenge like this before
3545309 its the most inexperienced offensive line that i have ever been associated with but theyre good kids theyre willing to work but at this point we have a long long way to go
3545310 i had one of the very best offensive lines in college football if not the best
3545311 when i left ucla in 1995 our left tackle was jonathan ogden and his backup was kris farris and they both won the outland trophy
3545312 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3545313 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3545314 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3545315 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3545316 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3545317 ive been getting briefings from colleagues in terms of what sprep does internally as a secretariat but not forgetting the big picture of spreps role in terms of engaging effectively with members the donor community stakeholders international and regional organizations
3545318 my key objective is to help the executive and management of the secretariat to take this organization to a new level in terms of efficiency and delivering the kind of services sprep is mandated to deliver ensuring that our members get the benefit of these services
3545319 i think sprep is at a crossroads the issues that we have to deal with now are not just particular to the pacific but they are global in nature and as such are much more complex and serious i believe we are at a point where sprep can really make a difference if we move in the right direction
3545320 i am excited not just about my new position but more so about the kind of issues and challenges that this organization has to deal with at this point in time and the role i can play to address those key environmental issues in a way that will bring understanding to our members
3545321 the march symbolizes both the evil and hopeful sides of humanity the evil with the constant balancing act of power within government religion and our financial institutions there lies the chance of those most hungry for power to alter and restrict our freedoms for their gain the hopeful this represents the faith in mankind as the most powerful force on the planet if we come together and do not fight over religion class and borders then we hold the key to a peaceful world there are two possible futures in store either a march of power and greed or a march of a unified human race

3545325 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3545326 you can harvest those resources and transform them into profitable goods to be sold in europe to other colonies or the native peoples you can found churches and let the desire for religious freedom draw colonists to the new world with time the borders of your settlement will grow thanks the construction of new buildings and the immigration of additional colonists
3545327 they republican lawmakers and president george w bush have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3545328 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3545329 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote

3545332 i personally feel there are a lot of restrictions that should not be there
3545333 people who get these carry permits are extremely law abiding citizens
3545334 those who have no regard for the law are carrying guns anyway
3545335 but what we saw was only one side having the chance to express themselves
3545336 firearms on college campuses and schools those are some very serious issues
3545337 there is no reason for disarming an adult attending educational facilities
3545338 we dont have the problems from the people who take the time to get the carry license
3545339 those are the ones we dont worry about too much
3545340 the idea that somehow law enforcement can make a distinction between someone who is intending to commit harm and someone who is intending to defend other people thats a false distinction
3545341 thats not something law enforcement can figure out on the front end

3545380 throughout the first three seasons of atlantis we were always sharing resources with stargate sg 1 be it the tv series or the dvd movies
3545381 as a result because of time constraints we werent able to really sit back and i think plan out the atlantis seasons quite as concisely as we could have which is what we did in year four
3545382 i just thought id get that out of the way
3545383 im sure we would have gotten there eventually but i appreciate your directness
3545384 i think it happened when i started being more responsible myself
3545385 when i quit drinking and started showing up to work on time that might have had something to do with it that was when opportunities started presenting themselves
3545386 the first years of the show youre just so giddy about getting something like a stargate its all about having a good time
3545387 and i wasnt alone oh no i had some knuckleheads with me its just when you get to the point that you dont ever grow up thats when it becomes a problem but i was very fortunate our producers were very patient with me for a number of years and frankly had more faith that i would come around than i did

3545412 while these broad trends are clearly evident the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict
3545413 there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy but it is important that we recognise there are potentially a number of positive influences
3545414 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic growth with credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade
3545415 while it is clearly a time to be cautious the current environment presents well managed banks like the commonwealth bank of australia with opportunities to grow even stronger

3545442 working on an immediate patch for customers in production vmware expects to fix the issue in code in the next 36 hours once qa testing has been completed
3545443 this certainly appears to be the most publicized bug for vmware so far and i think it is damaging to vmware and virtualization as a whole the hypervisor is the lowest software level on the server and if you have an issue like this boom all your infrastructure is down
3545444 software will always have bugs but a widespread issue like this that affects all vms is really damaging especially at this point in time where virtualization is starting to take off vmware is going to have to fix this fast provide an explanation and outline what they will do to strengthen their qa in the future
3545445 weve just encountered a serious bug with our esx cluster serious enough that i thought i should post about it here as a prior warning for others running esx 3 5 update 2
3545446 as enterprises move towards a fully virtualized infrastructure issues like this certainly will make people think about adopting multiple hypervisors and not putting all your eggs in one basket
3545447 if you are 100 virtualized using a single vendor one software bug or an exploitable security flaw in the hypervisor could instantly freeze your entire infrastructure these are the risks you take if you have a monoculture weve seen it before with things like windows ie etc
3545448 we were proactively notified by vmware monday they told us these are the symptoms and what would happen if you powered down your virtual machines
3545449 they gave us the general prescription in terms of troubleshooting and things to avoid such as powering down
3545450 i would consider this a very severe bug just by the nature of it it sounded worse than previous bugs

3545471 the most important thing is to not put him in harms way but if were not going to have the availability of his services theres no sense in keeping him on the active roster
3545472 the problem is i havent been able to push off
3545473 if i try that and it still hurts ill have to tell them hopefully that doesnt happen

3545519 president mwai kibaki has today directed the implementation of a 24 hours 7 days a week service delivery at the port of mombasa
3545520 all the relevant government organs have one week to fully implement the directive
3545521 it is a very good move it means reduced number of days for businessmen bringing goods to rwanda as you know very well time is money
3545522 it is high time because there has been a lot of congestion
3545523 customers are looking for efficiency when ships call at the two ports the shipping lines would be happy for both ports to be efficient not just one efficient port
3545524 president kibaki has always talked about accountable and efficient government but it is his former arch foe odinga who is out in the field whipping everybody into line
3545525 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out break
3545526 peaking at about 5 1 million at the height of the hungry season between january and march 2009
3545527 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3545528 if it means staying in this country for 6 months i will do that
3545529 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3545530 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3545531 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that doesnt include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3545532 yes we remain committed to dialogue but we want a fair power sharing arrangement
3545533 we will now have to go back to the people and explain our position they can go ahead and form their government we made our position clear that this issue is now in the hands of the facilitator
3545534 the president has said they have not collapsed and that is the position
3545535 what would happen if we it stopped supporting the end user and we simply only supported from the corporate network in
3545536 using a botnet which is a network of hacked computers very many computers with such a network you can shut down websites just by making all of the nodes in the botnet send a lot of data to the sites to be shut down
3545537 thats pretty common it is used by criminal organizations for blackmailing companies as well as for revenge attacks etc
3545538 if they are saying that traffic is being redirected well it may be using the dns domain name system attack or it might be that they have actually hacked into those computers in order to route and control the traffic
3545539 i have made a decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities to peace
3545540 the operation has achieved its goal security for peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor was punished suffering huge losses
3545541 the tragic incident took place at around 11 a m when the truck was plying from paf badaber camp to peshawar for ration and utilities
3545542 there were about 8 10 paf personnel including airmen and civilians who were traveling on the truck when the incident took place
3545543 the injured personnel have been shifted to nearby hospitals the cause of this accident is being investigated
3545544 taliban movement had warned that we would react across the country if the operation was not launched
3545545 were in a panic were coming back these last few days were very tense
3545546 now western countries have to give full support to georgia and not let russia change georgian president mikheil saakashvilis presidency with a pro russian government in georgia
3545547 what happens if russians came to our territory with tanks tomorrow saying that they have their citizens here
3545548 if we just allow russia to do this if we dont adopt our own stance then we will lose face in the eyes of the world
3545549 by this economic blockade they have completely finished the apple industry at least for this year because our crop was ready and it came back
3545550 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3545551 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3545552 be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3545553 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3545554 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3545555 we are fulfilling our agreement with the georgian government that in an emergency we would assist them in redeploying their troops
3545556 we are honoring that commitment and we are following through with that
3545557 i have made a decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the goals of the operation have been achieved
3545558 the safety of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been established the aggressor has been punished and has suffered significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3545559 if there are little pockets of opposition and other aggressive manifestations we will make a decision to liquidate them
3545560 this does not mean we have ceased all actions particularly our intelligence activities and so on that would be simply unreasonable we are trying to keep the situation under control and most importantly we are waiting for georgias official reaction
3545561 it is perfectly normal that russia wants to defend its own interests and the interests of russians inside russia as well as russian speakers outside russia
3545562 it is equally important that we i mean the international community want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3545563 one not to resort to the use of force two to end all military action completely
3545564 three to provide access to humanitarian aid four georgian troops return to their permanent locations five russian troops move to the line prior to the beginning of hostilities russian peacekeepers exercise additional security measures until international mechanism are created and six the beginning of an international discussion about the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia and ways of ensuring their lasting security
3545565 this doesnt mean that a sovereign state is allowed to do whatever it pleases even sovereign states have to answer for their actions
3545566 and while sovereignty is based on the will of the people and the constitution territorial integrity as a rule represents the real state of affairs
3545567 can the ossetians and the abkhaz and do they want to be a part of georgia
3545568 this question should be put to them and they will give their own unambiguous answer it is not russia or any other country that should answer this question
3545569 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3545570 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3545571 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3545572 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3545573 we have left kodori there was an evacuation there were no casualties
3545574 we offered the georgians a chance to leave the kodori gorge to minimize casualties but they refused to go so we had to use aviation and artillery
3545575 at five oclock this morning we entered the northern part of the gorge and since then we have reached azhara the main village in upper kodori we deployed our unit there and are now moving to abkhazias state border
3545576 that russian announcement of a cessation of military operations concerns south ossetia
3545577 we are liberating our territory the russian president said the phase of forcing the enemy the aggressor out of south ossetia is completed georgian troops are still present on our territory we will not consider our operation finished until theyve been forced out of here
3545578 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3545579 any future steps toward the de escalation of tensions and the restoration of peace will have to be clarified at a later stage
3545580 moreover i wont hide the fact that our approach the russian approach to the negotiation process is going to have to undergo substantial changes because we have lost all remaining trust in the georgian leadership
3545581 the announcement of the end of hostilities by russia is the news that we have been waiting for
3545582 now it is necessary to implement the cease fire and to draw a quick timetable so that everyone returns to the positions they held before the conflict
3545583 as president of georgia i stand before you in very difficult circumstances yesterday i saw with my own eyes how we were bombed
3545584 we urge ukraine and other countries to also leave the commonwealth of independent states which is dominated by russia
3545585 we have taken the decision to declare russian armed forces in abkhazia and south ossetia occupying forces
3545586 has killed our russian citizens ordered the crushing of women and children by tanks and the burning alive of a group of girls herded into a cattle shed
3545587 and not only did he do all this with a background of european flags but he declared that he was safeguarding american values
3545588 its clear that what we need is that strong verification regime let me just leave it at that for the moment it was a minimum 45 day period
3545589 we as of yet dont have that verification regime and the north koreans know what they need to do in terms of putting together that regime and to date we havent seen that
3545590 this whole exercise is an exercise for a transition to democracy and a real transition to democracy what you have seen today in the frontier province assembly is a vote of 107 against general musharraf and only four in his favor
3545591 no plans to force anyone from power this is not in our political culture at all
3545592 russia supports the osce and eu line that a ceasefire agreement is absolutely essential but we have questions over several points
3545593 we can hardly agree to this as it implies that georgian so called peacekeepers should be in south ossetia georgian peacekeepers cannot be there they committed crimes shooting their own russian colleagues with whom they were serving
3545594 the fact that with his barbaric acts in south ossetia he saakashvili has undermined the viability of the georgian state shows the ossetian and abkhaz peoples that they will not be safe together with georgia
3545595 the crimes committed by the tbilisi regime in south ossetia merit investigation at an international tribunal
3545596 has killed our russian citizens ordered the crushing of women and children by tanks and the burning alive of a group of girls herded into a cattle shed and not only did he do all this on the background of european flags but he declared that he was safeguarding american values
3545597 i have made a decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the goals of the operation have been achieved
3545598 the safety of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been established the aggressor has been punished and has suffered significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3545599 if there are little pockets of opposition and other aggressive manifestations we will make a decision to liquidate them
3545600 our goal is to free the kodori gorge of georgian troops
3545601 today the assault begins it is a high mountain operation
3545602 we are entering a new stage with about 3 000 troops with artillery aviation and infantry reinforcements
3545603 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3545604 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3545605 be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3545606 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3545607 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3545608 it is not in our traditions to topple anyone or put someone on a throne
3545609 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers they can no longer remain
3545610 they brought shame on themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes and shot at comrades with whom they served in the same peacekeeping unit
3545611 it was either the car or the old gentleman and his scooter there was no choice the car is scrap now but we could all have been killed the important thing is no one was hurt
3545612 i only bought the car on ebay for 1 500 three weeks ago and that was the first time id had the roof down john and i are window cleaners and were on our way to another job
3545613 we came around the bend and i saw the old man on his scooter starting to cross the road i didnt think hed seen us and i knew it was him or the car
3545614 i swerved to avoid him and we hit the kerb went through a road sign and then the metal fence and trees the car turned over before stopping upside down
3545615 another couple of feet and wed have been down the steep slope and into the river we could have been killed
3545616 i was crossing the road on my scooter as i have done hundreds of times before
3545617 i stay on the pavements but you have to cross the road somewhere everyone was very lucky
3545618 there could be a change in conditions around a corner or even when the weather changes
3545619 we and the mdc headed by mr mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is trying to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3545620 we are proceeding and mr mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3545621 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out
3545622 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that does not include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3545623 what we should be talking about is food security not food
3545624 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3545625 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster
3545626 a little bit of the cat has jumped out of the bag
3545627 when i first approached graffiti artists i got cold shoulders people thought i was working for the eugene police department
3545628 so many brands t shirts and shoes are influenced by street art
3545629 for people to turn their nose up at street art is kind of silly
3545630 i dont think the mural will deter graffiti but i hope that if we do something really cool that people will really like it and respect it
3545631 i also hope there will be a sense of pride in the neighborhood
3545632 i want to create a sense of community and ownership of the park
3545633 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
3545634 i think you have overpaid in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
3545635 id like to see timesheets posted on the internet for the work of the directors as well as the executives of the company
3545636 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
3545637 what about grants for sex education in the united states should they include instructions about using contraceptives or should it be bushs policy which is just abstinence
3545638 so no contraception no counseling on contraception just abstinence do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of hiv
3545639 our collaboration with amd is especially important to us because it provides us with early access to some of the latest graphics technology

3545646 its amazing that nobody was killed he was very lucky
3545647 today is a joke no agenda no bill no plan
3545648 were already hearing rumors of other moves and i think this is just as important as the next one or the one after that
3545649 i think its obvious that this is what this commission was formed for to take a look at the economic impact and i think they spoke overwhelmingly
3545650 does this decision legally inject or confirm what the administration does to the point where it can stop the administration from doing it according to the law the answer is no
3545651 however given the overwhelming volume of evidence that we heard on the economic and legal issues associated with this proposal i personally think it would be unwise and contrary to the publics interest
3545652 we will be moving forward with the geographic relocation of idots division of traffic safety to harrisburg as previously mentioned well be working with the employees who do not choose to relocate within the terms of their contracts to find positions for them in springfield we will follow all appropriate timelines and guidelines as we move forward
3545653 the facts of the case point heavily towards the commissions recommendation ultimately if the executive branch chooses to go in a different direction there may be someone who takes an exception with that
3545654 it should not be my decision as to how much i am compensated
3545655 state government is in shambles nothing is getting done its just not the time for anyone in state government to get a pay increase

3545659 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3545660 we have no plans to depose anyone this is in general not in our political culture and not in the arsenal of our foreign policy
3545661 today john mccain said americans are supporting georgia we are georgians today despite that it is dangerous to be in tbilisi today i want to say that here stand the leaders of these european countries and i want to say thank you

3545664 we are overwhelmed by the helping hand extended by the senior citizens but they should be capable enough to stand at chowks for at least two hours singh said
3545665 they are not handing over motor licences but giving away licences to kill he alleged meanwhile singh has promised senior citizens that the number of meetings will be increased and organise one at pimpri chinchwad to facilitate senior citizens staying there

3545677 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3545678 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3545679 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term

3545717 is there such a thing as a mind which is merely a brain which is a machine would one have a mind if one had no body or no body except for a brain whether or not it is a machine if one had no sense organs no hands no ability to move or speak no sensory pains or pleasures no appetites no bodily needs if we grant for the sake of argument that such may be theoretically possible we must conclude at the same time that it is not imaginable and for the most literal of reasons such a mind could contain no image

3545749 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3545750 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3545751 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3545752 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3545753 that was the main reason i was able to play so far into the playoffs
3545754 ive always played well in north carolina and i love the style of golf here
3545755 theres nothing more i want than to play on that team
3545756 its not like im playing that bad im just not putting it together on the weekend if i can get hot ive got a chance im ready to play im healthy and im hungry
3545757 i think thats the explanation for a couple of the mistakes but well try to keep them fresh this week so that they can be full speed and fresh and hopefully see them make some plays
3545758 es poco com n ver gente vestida as de modo que las v ctimas lo estaban mirando
3545759 he was cheering me up more than i was able to cheer him up
3545760 hes a tough dude because i wouldve passed out woke up and passed out again probably a couple more times
3545761 kids are kids and you look at kids and they take their shoes off and run around all the time
3545762 when your feet hurt you want to take your shoes off maybe his feet were hurting that day so maybe he wanted to take his shoes off
3545763 you know what the greatest part of that was they never once said anything they never booed until we became that team that was able to beat canada
3545764 when they got scared of us as a group playing against them thats when they started
3545765 when you first start your career you wonder if youre ever going to play and then all of a sudden within the blink of an eye its over
3545766 i appreciated everything that usa hockey ever did because im not sure i ever would have been an nhler without the opportunity they gave me
3545767 there was a lot of proud guys in that locker room when i look back on it i still have that same feeling
3545768 it was probably the most talented team ive ever been around
3545769 it was one of my greatest moments in the game
3545770 i had never really been a champion id had a load of personal success but i had never really had any team success
3545771 after we won i remember standing on the blue line next to and i asked him what i should do because i had never won before
3545772 the biggest change in hockey for women i noticed was when we returned from nagano in 98
3545773 i never needed confirmation about it being the right decision
3545774 just having them show the faith in me that they wanted me apart of the program was all i needed
3545775 hes treating and hes frustrated as well but hes got a great great attitude
3545776 from all indications everyone feels great about madieu getting back on the field and being 100 percent soon
3545777 i think i earned a little bit of respect when i was out there friday playing with them and made a few touchdown saving tackles
3545778 thats how you earn the defenses respect just by making plays
3545779 it was just good to see him out there with the lights on
3545780 he had to make a couple of tackles in the back end which is all you care about when it gets to you right there to get him on the ground and he did a good job of doing that
3545781 my guard is still up can it be this easy can my responsibilities be this easy thats the biggest thing just relaxing and playing
3545782 if youre talking you know what youre doing you just call it out
3545783 i could imagine it makes the coaches a little bit more comfortable but it makes me a little bit more comfortable calling it out and making sure everybodys on the same page

3545802 as a result the authoritarian political establishments have become identified with secularist approaches to politics and modernization the most effective opposition to authoritarian regimes is expressed through a reaffirmation of the islamic identity and heritage
3545803 islam however also rejects any distinction between the religious community and the political community hence there is no equipoise between caesar and god and political participation is linked to religious affiliation
3545804 for instance the claim of precautionary measures blocking the means is used in saudi arabia to justify a wide range of restrictive laws against women including the prohibition against driving cars this is a relatively novel invention in islamic state practices and in many instances it amounts to the use of shariah in passing laws that create an oppressive condition a condition that itself is contrary to the principles of justice under shariah
3545805 not considered to be against the teaching of the quran
3545806 even if such a renewal is not considered tashri based on shariah it is not conceived of as being against it
3545807 supported by gods commands the prophets sayings and practices and the consensus of the muslim community
3545808 the articles of faith the pillars of islam and the moral principles of religion

3545820 i just happened to see this domain name listed within the avn online archives while i was browsing the site
3545821 i contacted sam regarding this domain a few weeks ago and indicated an interest in brokering the deal ive been in the domain name industry for more than two years and i know many of the potential buyers so i gave it a shot
3545822 it was something of a marketing test bed and had a good degree of success
3545823 the problem was always justifying the work input against the return
3545824 i cant disclose the buyer or the selling price due to the non disclosure agreement but it was a good sell for everyone involved
3545825 i was never prepared to give the domain away cheaply and it took some time to find a serious buyer when one appeared it was the right time to jump and move on
3545826 i can share with you that mr sutts has been following the direction of city council and ah i dont believe there have been any face to face meetings since then there may be some scheduled this week as mr sutts tries to respond to council resolution
3545827 kilpatrick wanted to travel to windsor that friday but francis told him he had previous commitments
3545828 eddie called me right after that call and said they were requesting a meeting
3545829 windsors mayor says now is not the time to talk about a tunnel deal with detroit windsor mayor eddie francis says city council is standing behind its decision to wait until the dust settles between detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick and detroit city council to proceed with discussions about purchasing the us side of the tunnel
3545830 july 11 2008 in fact he said attorney william phillips who has represented detroit in the negotiations spoke with sutts as recently as thursday night and sutts asked for phillips to provide him detroit documents on the deal
3545831 july 11 2008 sutts said he still has authority to continue speaking with detroit officials and negotiations would resume if detroit council members state their support for finalizing the sale in fact he spoke today with deputy mayor anthony adams and attorney william phillips who has represented the city of detroit in negotiations

3545836 the provision of television services has always been the responsibility of the federal government
3545837 it is totally unacceptable that the majority of residents within the district council of yankalilla will lose their television service

3545839 i think that its a huge loss to the community a huge loss to us all
3545840 were talking to other agencies but for now theres little hope
3545841 theyve had such a great track record everyone will need to pitch in
3545842 alternatively the state government could continue to control smoking bans as they have done in the past within hotels and restaurants and in the same way as they apply restricted areas relating to alcohol consumption
3545843 given the conditions of the day it was just a fantastic turnout
3545844 people are concerned interest in this issue is building all the time
3545845 we need to keep the community informed as to what we are doing
3545846 the feeling amongst the community is that they dont want sea water in they are very supportive of councils request to get flows from upstream
3545847 there is lots of suggestions about temporary weirs and these proposals are being investigated
3545848 we are hoping within the next week or two we will be made aware what these assessments are
3545849 all the information is being fed up through the council
3545850 we do appreciate time is of the essence and we are all hoping for fresh water and lots of it
3545851 but in the event that doesnt happen people need to understand the consequences of the lakes going acid it is so catastrophic that letting the salt water in really is the lesser of the two evils
3545852 the minister karlene maywald has made the point that theres a 75 per cent chance of not having to let in sea water but it is all about probabilities
3545853 the only way we will save the river is to scrap the current agreements

3545886 i would love to shop for furniture but i will admit most of my pieces are hand me downs

3545891 it will put us in line with the majority of state universities in ohio
3545892 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
3545893 hoard food peeps this is going to get really ugly in a few months literally everything you put in your mouths is processed by factories that clean and sanitize with either koh or caustic there isnt a pipe conveyor floor holding tank process line etc that puts meat veggies fruit dairy or processed packaged food into the food chain that will not be affected by this

3546066 the reason given for this is that the us is much more conservative they have a much higher rate of cesareans and the representative told me this was due to the financial gain that cesareans provide to them a machine that may reduce the rates of cesareans and provide a printout of legal evidence that a labor was progressing and the baby was fine is not something doctors in the us are very excited about europe is actually looking to avoid cesareans and therefore they welcome tools that allow them to do so the us is not interested in a tool that would help them avoid cesareans

3546076 collaboration with besang on 3d ic development demonstrates the expert technical capability of nnfc and the commercialization of emerging semiconductor technologies we expect that besangs breakthrough 3d ic technology will provide ultimate low cost and high performance solutions for the semiconductor industry
3546077 i am pleased that besangs 3d ic development is the first success story of excellent collaboration and technology exchange between snf and nnfc
3546078 one of unique features of besangs 3d ic is the capability of unrestricted 3d interconnections using conventional via technologies that does not require wafer alignment nor through silicon vias for 3d interconnects
3546079 conventional cmos technology is facing its scaling limits therefore this emerging 3d ic technology will extend the lifespan of cmos technology because it is an excellent alternative way to accommodate more devices on a given wafer area
3546080 besangs 3d ic is a novel combination of short process steps formation of array blocks in 3d thin layer transfer using unique wafer bonding followed by low temperature processing
3546081 hence there is a high possibility for this breakthrough 3d ic to provide low cost manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor industry besangs 3d ic is a very attractive technology and one wonders why other companies have not thought about it however i always believe in the dynamics of small companies as my colleague dawon kahng and i worked as a small team within a large organization when we co invented the non volatile memory in 1967 at bell labs
3546082 we can imagine evolution of semiconductor technologies through 3d vertical stacking instead of conventional horizontal shrinking which is getting more expensive and facing ever more technical difficulties
3546083 for rapid wafer processing engineers at nnfc and students and staff members at snf reserved the tools for besang with such strong support from nnfc and snf besang has successfully reached this level of technology development in a very short time i would like to say special thanks to all at nnfc and snf

3546095 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3546096 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3546097 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3546098 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3546099 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3546100 iea melaporkan penurunan terbesar dalam 26 tahun perlu banyak argumen untuk bullish namun us 113 saya rasa tidaklah murah
3546101 perhatian ke masalah geopolitik selalu memberikan dukungan yang baik untuk harga minyak dan berita ini harusnya bisa memberikan kelegaan kepada pasar tentang kekhawatiran ekspor dari azeri ke pelabuhan di georgia
3546102 saya kira menneg bumn juga harus bisa mendorong ini bahkan kalau perlu bagi bumn yang laporan keuangannya tidak bagus direksinya diganti saja
3546103 tapi saya sepakat sama bu menteri keuangan bagaimana nanti bumn yang sakit juga bisa menyiapkan laporan keuangannya dengan demikian persoalan persoalan yang mengganjal seperti rdi bisa mendapatkan perhatian langsung dari departemen keuangan dan itu bagus sekali
3546104 kita oke tidak ada masalah dengan manajemen indosat inikan baru belum setahun tapi mungkin direksi yang dari singapura diganti atau tidak kita tidak tahu tergantung pemegang saham baru tapi mungkin yang diganti nanti hanya komisaris
3546105 artinya direksi boleh diganti atau tidak karena itu hak pemegang saham mayoritas kita tidak punya pandangan bagi kita kalau direksi masih baik ya jalankan terus tapi kalau rupslb itu ganti komisaris kalau pengurus diganti atau tidak ya tidak apa apa
3546106 saya hanya terima surat undangan dari indosat karena kita hanya pemegang saham minoritas dan ini tidak menyangkut kepentingan pemerintah dalam hal itu kalau iya kita akan bicara

3546111 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3546112 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3546113 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3546114 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3546115 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3546116 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3546117 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3546118 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3546119 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3546120 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3546121 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3546122 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3546123 just because some fish are flying fish it does not follow that all fish want to fly

3546131 south ossetians supported by russians are committing horrible massacres in georgian villages
3546132 south ossetian separatists entered the village of disevi in gori district and committed acts of ethnic cleansing burning houses and attacking the population
3546133 we have been getting reports lately that groups near tskhinvali were entering villages previously under control of the georgian government and there have been killings rampages ethnic cleansing in the areas
3546134 we have credible reports of camps set up in vladikavkaz where people are interned of on site killings and of executions of innocent civilians
3546135 we have been getting different indications and reports of ethnic cleansing in upper abkhazia from which the whole population was thrown out and a number of people killed
3546136 i would move forward at the right time with the application for membership in nato by georgia
3546137 as you know through the nato membership that if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3546138 we dont have i think right now the ability to intervene in any way except in a humanitarian economic way and do what we can to help the georgians
3546139 russia no longer shares any of the values and principles of the g 8 so they should be excluded
3546140 probably had a higher opinion of russian prime minister vladimir putin than i do
3546141 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country

3546143 if both browny and the club were exactly on the same page he would have signed by now
3546144 clearly we are not on the same page at this stage because we havent reached agreement
3546145 there are only two things you can talk about terms and dollars and they are the issues we are working through
3546146 the way negotiations are going are the way they often go
3546147 there is nothing unusual people are currently putting two and two together and getting 48
3546148 we advise everyone to stay off the ground because you can be evicted and also face heavy fines
3546149 its for the safety of both players and supporters we would say to everyone stay off the ground
3546150 im sure it will happen but to what magnitude im not sure
3546151 its tradition and im sure a lot would remember the jason dunstall days and just run out there
3546152 im pretty sure that at least half the cheer squad would jump the fence and run out
3546153 because i run it ive got to try and do security in the cheer squad but in saying that i cant hold everybody back
3546154 conditions involving everyones safety including people who run on the ground is an issue so we would be encouraging people not to do it
3546155 obviously we have to make plans in case some people decide to do it
3546156 one would hope people wouldnt jump the fence and be silly
3546157 there is a substantial fine if people enter the playing arena hopefully the public will respect the security presence because you dont want any of them to be hurt or any of the players
3546158 but if a few do jump the fence we will go into a security and police procedure just to make sure the players and officials are safe on the oval
3546159 each year we see more progress toward my dream of a healthy future for all my kids
3546160 the telethon fuels that progress by showing all americans whats at stake and appealing to their generosity for help to save and improve precious lives
3546161 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore

3546168 richard versalle a tenor performing at new yorks metropolitan opera house suffered a heart attack and fell 10 feet from a ladder to the stage just after singing the line
3546169 all you have to do is decide what to do with the time that is given you
3546170 im surprised about the speculation because i havent thought much about it going home
3546171 im in good health and hopefully ive got two or three years to go a two year deal would be good
3546172 im not in any rush whether its done next week or next month im not going to be too fazed
3546173 we havent spoken to simon or his management nor have we discussed him at list management meetings because we figured he would play out his career with brisbane
3546174 weve been semi serious in the past but he always indicated to us that he never wanted to leave
3546175 because i was lucky enough to play in a premiership in my fourth season i feel a connection with some ownership to the footy club
3546176 we hear every year that davis wants out of collingwood to go to adelaide and perth and he is contracted to collingwood next year
3546177 they are talking about their futures and what they see in their future at port adelaide
3546178 weve got lots of flexibility in the salary cap and we look forward to the best player available coming here and making an impact straight away
3546179 its a real honour if youd have asked me 18 months ago this was the last thing on my mind
3546180 ive had my fair share of setbacks there have been plenty of forks in the road but i chose to go on and keep living the dream
3546181 its a funny one i looked five to six weeks ahead after missing the bulldogs game and i thought that if i played every game id play my 250th against my old team the saints which would have been quite ironic
3546182 once i missed the hawthorn game i thought thatll be great ill have 50 family and friends there in adelaide im rapt that it will be back home where it all began
3546183 my attention to detail and ability to monitor my training along with fitness coach david buttifant i think thats what has allowed me to do it if i had to do the pre season that port adelaide or adelaide did i wouldnt have got through
3546184 im going down the track of planning for life after football but im maintaining my flexibility in case i do decide to play on ultimately it is micks malthouses decision
3546185 we naturally dismiss a lot of negative things in our own minds about past circumstances whether it be football or life
3546186 i had a lot of disappointments from the saints days i think ive become a respected footballer and thats what i set out to do when i was given another chance
3546187 i just wanted to be respected id be lying if i said i wasnt motivated by the way things finished at st kilda
3546188 it was as good as any win outside of finals that ive been involved in
3546189 there was just such a degree of satisfaction seeing young johnny mccarthy and chris dawes come into the team and performing like that in their first games
3546190 it wasnt just because who we had out of the side what hit home was the fact that im still having this wonderful opportunity to have experiences like that to watch those debuts and to see them be involved in such a great win get the best of foxtel
3546191 this is 15th against 16th it is the battle for the wooden spoon and we dont want to win that spoon
3546192 coach dean bailey prides himself on being a fighter and being competitive and winning i am the same i hate losing
3546193 last weeks loss to geelong was devastating for everyone it was very difficult to sit in the stands and watch the game
3546194 this week there will be a different attitude we really want to win
3546195 the coach doesnt want us to finish last we have a chance of winning our last three games and this is the first one
3546196 we have got to focus on it and we have to beat the eagles
3546197 we have that scope there are going to be uncontracted players around so it does give you an opportunity to add to your list
3546198 we might have the first pick in the pre season draft but we wouldnt be happy to give away our first draft pick
3546199 the emphasis for us is building a list that can play for us for the next 10 years
3546200 melbourne supporters have been complaining that we havent been playing saturday games
3546201 the fundraiser was about real people saying i will support the club unconditionally and now its time for the rest of our supporter base to do the same thing get the best of foxtel

3546204 albemarle continues to support growing demand for ethanox 330 but we have experienced unprecedented increases in raw materials waste handling and disposal costs
3546205 the price increase will allow continued investment in providing this important product to the polymer market

3546213 teaming up with a programmer makes local events more special it offers an opportunity for outdoor channels viewers to experience the network up close as well as for the programmer to connect with its audience on a grassroots level
3546214 the chippewa valley outdoor games draws an extremely large audience of outdoor enthusiasts creating an ideal means of increasing awareness for both charter and outdoor channel
3546215 this event captures the spirit of the great outdoors and offers a fun time for the whole family
3546216 we are excited about partnering with charter to sponsor an event that perfectly aligns with the outdoor lifestyle

3546224 thats why the protective cover dont leave any makeup stains that might make me suspicious huh
3546225 well why not i wasnt getting it at home from you anymore
3546226 i thought we were doing just fine in er that department
3546227 sure things were just great with us until until you brought thomas hardy into the bedroom
3546228 it was jude the obscure thats your idea of gothic seduction
3546229 ha thomas hardy isnt gothic i mean i know people have tried to give him some sort of neo gothic mantle but that is debatable
3546230 sure there may be elements of the gothic in hardy but thats a far cry from saying hes gothic why id even go as far as saying that
3546231 yeah its walter out at the bucket inn on route 12 uh huh good good look im getting some complaints some ruckus down in room 5 and well i saw some of the folks earlier and i think you might wanna send a patrol car around and check it out uh huh sure sure i appreciate it look i hate to bother you guys on a night like this but you know what its like when the circus is in town
3546232 you cannot begin to know the difference you have made in so many lives
3546233 you know what teenagers are like if you as a parent suggest something he doesnt really listen to me
3546234 hi my name is screen name and im an archaholic
3546235 i know you want to hear david archuletas crush and you got it
3546236 senator i noticed this in your statement with senator lugar back in april
3546237 those in whom you put full trust and confide everything
3546238 its one of those things you have to go with
3546239 he just said youve got great range on the ball
3546240 the fans you see theyre very upbeat and energized and its lifted the defense up too
3546241 hes a hard worker hes a winner and we have to compete with that
3546242 i like to get an early jump on quarterbacks sometimes and with him hell be looking one way and the next thing you know hes coming back the other way he keeps you honest and i think thats probably the best thing for us in the secondary you cant really cheat
3546243 its hard work you know hes going to sling the ball in there tight and he has that quick release so you know you just have to match up with your receivers tight but he just throws the ball hard and even if theres good coverage theres some nice balls that he throws that he can get in tight spots
3546244 hey going through this whole process i didnt think brett favre would be in a jet uniform when he was going through all that stuff with the packers just to see him here and hes on our team were happy to have him the fans theyre energetic and theyre happy for him too
3546245 where water is unsafe a bottle fed child is up to 25 times more likely to die as a result of diarrhoea than a breastfed child
3546246 i get asked about beyonce all the time but i try and make fun of it
3546247 our financial results for both the third quarter and thirty nine weeks ended june 29 2008 were affected by the downturn in the economy and the negative effect it had on the family budgets of our valued customers
3546248 we held the line on some price increases to assist our customers in coping with outrageous fuel costs and general price increases in all the family needs which negatively affected our earnings
3546249 however our plan was to hold our customer counts and that was accomplished with an increase of 324 000 customers during the last 10 weeks
3546250 this means that when our customers have more to spend well get our share and unlike some retailers we wont have to go looking for our customers
3546251 we are focused on controlling expenses during these tough economic times while we continue to provide our customers with the quality and value that they expect and deserve
3546252 by the end of our current fiscal year we will complete our new refrigerated distribution facility the final phase of distribution consolidation
3546253 our new state of the art distribution center will allow us to better serve our valued customers
3546254 we remain committed to being the low price leader while providing a friendly and satisfying shopping experience to our valued customers on each and every one of their visits to our supermarkets
3546255 all that stuff that happened with shia definitely didnt help things when adrian saw isabel with shia he knew it was time to move on and made the decision to end things

3546257 i think that everyone feels like they would welcome with open arms as neighbors and individuals but as a national center in a small town i think its probably a bad fit

3546266 from our perspective we are always on the look out for small bolt on acquisitions

3546274 and i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3546275 he insinuated threats against us and said we had to continue doing what we were doing
3546276 i know for a fact that he was an informant during the time that he was dealing with us
3546277 his argument would basically be that gonzales threatened him as a government agent in order to induce him to plant the sniffer
3546278 he would not have planted the sniffer but for the threat and his sentence was based on that
3546279 let me give you a piece of advice about your washing machine it too requires zero emotional intelligence but shell do more than kiss if you lean on her just so
3546280 just dont spend your time drawing 1 080 dots in the box
3546281 big dog has military applications in that you could send a few into the enemy camp and creep the heck out of them
3546282 the day is coming when a single carrot freshly observed will set off a revolution
3546283 the use of antibiotics is a cornerstone of intensive livestock production and because this is such an enormous industry there will inevitably be a reluctance to change
3546284 no one wants to stop farmers using antibiotics when they are genuinely needed however there are a number of very serious problems now developing and the evidence increasingly suggests that food is part of the problem
3546285 antimicrobial resistance of bacteria is a growing concern as antimicrobials become less effective in fighting human infections
3546286 this coincides with a rise in bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in animal populations
3546287 we were four hours in drug testing as she was called for a random blood test as well it all got a bit manic because the press wanted plenty of time with her too
3546288 shes now on a recovery programme which should give her a real crack at both races
3546289 today shes going out to a quiet pool away from all the attention and well just try to train rest and recover with plenty of good food sleep and massage hopefully shell then come back fighting in a couple of days
3546290 when she got out i told her i just want to say becky adlington olympic champion because i wanted to be the first person she heard it from what a fantastic day
3546291 shes always had a prodigious technical talent focus and discipline
3546292 she is a very strong willed young woman those traits set you up in this game
3546293 she now does about 70km a week usually from 10 two hour sessions twice a day
3546294 theres a lot of speed work and hard endurance work off very short rest periods its a punishing routine but she does very well on it
3546295 it was a bit surreal because our plan for the race just didnt materialise
3546296 i thought whats going on here it was very cat and mouse and rebecca along with jo jackson who finished in third place were both clever to wait before coming through with those storming finishes
3546297 im not a betting man but shes obviously shes got a chance
3546298 but there are some big players in that race and this is a new experience for her if she doesnt swim her sunday best in the 800m heats she could end up watching the final from the stands
3546299 even though jeremy clarkson slagged them off as chavvy i dont care

3546316 this is a unique boat in that its the only high speed vessel of its type operating in an inland water way in north america
3546317 they are taking data from these engines and they are designed to meet the latest epa tier 2 standards
3546318 i dont think you could be the tennessee aquarium and have the reputation they have globally for environmental sensitivity without having a boat like this one

3546360 im playing for a medal but i have to get there first that will be the ultimate goal for me
3546361 how this story plays out really depends on whether the weakness in financials bleeds out to other sectors in the economy
3546362 they are bigger than us and forced us to make many turnovers
3546363 i wanted to win the game but it was impossible
3546364 it was hard work getting here and im enjoying it

3546369 the thoughts and the prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle for their freedom and independence
3546370 and he wanted me to say thank you to you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america
3546371 and i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3546372 in 2006 i visited senaki and reviewed the georgian troops who had served with honor beside american soldiers in iraq
3546373 two years ago i traveled to south ossetia my friends

3546381 ternyata apa yang telah terjadi cukup meyakinkan kami bahawa irama ini sebenarnya masih lagi mendapat tempat di kalangan generasi muda hari ini
3546382 dengan perubahan yang kami lakukan dalam memberikan variasi terhadap pemilihan lagu ternyata membuahkan hasil yang boleh dibanggakan
3546383 aspek yang paling kami utamakan adalah lontaran suara dan penyampaian yang merangkumi 50 peratus bukan itu sahaja apa yang kami cari juga adalah keaslian kerana untuk membawakan lagu lagu sebegini mereka ada potensi untuk terikut ikut penyanyi asal
3546384 namun itu tidak terjadi kali ini dan sebagai ketua juri saya dapat melihat peningkatan kualiti bakat dari tahun lalu
3546385 usah diperkatakan tentang pengorbanan kerana terlalu banyak yang telah dilakukan apa yang saya mahu lagu lagu ini terus mendapat tempat di hati golongan muda kerana lagu lagu ini begitu indah pada hemat saya juga kalau tiada inisiatif dari klasik nasional sendiri semua ini tidak akan terjadi
3546386 saya sudah biasa dengan lagu lagunya tetapi untuk persembahan saya pada malam ini saya telah mengubah dengan gaya dan cara saya sendiri saya tidak mahu terikut dengan gayanya kerana saya mahu tonjolkan diri saya
3546387 alhamdulillah berkat kesungguhan berlatih kemenangan menjadi milik saya semua ini tidak datang bergolek kerana saya melihat ini sebagai satu cabaran memandangkan kali pertama menyanyikan lagu yang tidak pernah saya dengar
3546388 saya juga secara peribadi tidak pernah menganggap lagu lagu klasik sebagai irama yang membosankan kerana ia mempunyai keistimewaan dan keunikannya jadi kalau bukan kami warga muda tidak menghidupkannya kembali siapa lagi
3546389 el objetivo del curso es contribuir con el desarrollo tur stico sustentable de la localidad con la formaci n de la calidad humana social y profesional del prestador de servicio d ndole las herramientas para que descubra la importancia y la necesidad del buen trato al cliente de c mo desenvolverse ante situaciones de quejas trabajo en equipo nivel de seguridad que deben brindar y convertirse en los guardianes de las reas que deseamos mostrar al mundo entero a trav s del turismo local nacional e internacional

3546393 as to facts she was to present and which she in fact testified to under oath
3546394 just what do you mean by socialism and what do you mean by democracy do you mean what marx and engels and lenin said or do you mean what stalin did
3546395 in russia we have socialism without democracy we have socialism without trial by jury habeas corpus or protection against the abuse of confession by torture we have socialism without civil liberty we have socialism without public avenues of protest we have socialism without equality for minorities we have socialism without any right of free artistic creation in so many words we have socialism without morality
3546396 that is socialism the american way of life is better
3546397 self conscious independent movement of the immense majority in the interest of the immense majority
3546398 the emancipation of the working class is the task of the workers themselves
3546399 in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy
3546400 democracy will gradually change and become a habit and finally wither away
3546401 in place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class antagonisms we shall have an association
3546402 a pure and limpid social system which is accommodated to the self government of the toilers and uninterrupted growth of universal equality all sided flowering of human personality unselfish honest and human relations between human beings

3546410 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3546411 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3546412 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3546413 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity
3546414 the fishing industry is not only pushing many fish species to the point of collapse but also their own future if they carry on emptying the oceans of sea life then very soon there will be nothing left for them to fish
3546415 we need the sylt outer reef to truly be protected and not just on paper that means an enforceable ban on fishing and sand and gravel extraction in the area to create an effective marine reserve only this will give the area a chance to recover after decades of exploitation
3546416 if the german government is not going to honour its commitments and give the sylt outer reef the protection it so badly needs then it is up to greenpeace to act by placing these rocky obstacles to stop trawling in the area we are sending a clear message that business as usual cannot continue
3546417 we had the grand ambition of getting all of these patents and whatnot
3546418 you would need something the size of a small office to get the appropriate amount of surface area
3546419 i never really got my hopes up too high on the scuba suit idea i guess it just seemed a little bit too far fetched
3546420 people have understood for about 100 years or so that these bubbles attached to insects have an important respiratory function
3546421 we started thinking about the issues of gas exchange and surface chemistry that allows this to happen
3546422 in some cases this lets the insect stay underwater indefinitely

3546427 oh my god i just threw up in my heart a little
3546428 well tell your dad i agree with him and i agree with you your dads slightly racist

3546430 should i just let people pee on my grave at my funeral
3546431 my problem with pete wentz marrying her is do people not have abortions anymore
3546432 we are seeing qila become more comfortable around the calf and spending short periods of time with the calfs grandmother
3546433 it will be interesting to see if there is spontaneous lactation
3546434 there has been lots of contact calling from the calf
3546435 weve found that octopuses effectively have six arms and two legs
3546436 it had been thought they used four tentacles for movement and the other four for feeding and manipulating objects but observations showed that they use the rearmost two to get around over rocks and the seabed
3546437 they also use these two legs to push off when they wish to swim and then other tentacles are used to propel them
3546438 we havent tried to take her out of the tank to weigh her because shed find that quite traumatic
3546439 the real surprise was the frequency with which octopuses employed their third tentacles from the front on both sides
3546440 more than half of the octopuses studied were found to display no bias at all for either right or left sided limbs the rest were split fairly evenly between those preferring the right side and those favouring the left
3546441 an octopuss eyes are angled towards the front of its body so if it used its eyes to determine which tentacles it mobilised you would expect the choice to favour those more directly in its line of view that was precisely what we found
3546442 we identified seven octopuses that genuinely do prefer one side over the other possibly because of some weakness in the other eye
3546443 if any of those animals should fall sick we can now care for them that little bit more efficiently by delivering food and medication from the direction they prefer as with any sickly animal any measure that reduces stress however slightly can make a crucial difference
3546444 oh well in that case can i take you out to dinner sometime better yet can i cook you dinner
3546445 finally a girl who likes good music im glad you dont listen to that jigaboo shit

3546457 spanish fashion chain zara has expanded so rapidly in recent months that it has overtaken its main us rival gap to become the worlds largest clothing retailer beloved by proponents of fast fashion zara has spread its reach across the globe at a time when gap has suffered from plummeting consumer spending in the us inditex zaras parent company recorded a 9 increase in sales to 2 218bn in the first quarter of its financial year it also benefited from the strength of the euro to edge slightly ahead of gap which saw its revenues fall by 10 and recorded sales of 2 169bn in the same period the difference may be tiny but inditex claims it is significant for the first time the spanish group has inched past its american rival
3546458 it follows the same oil stain pattern when moving into a new market this involves opening one insignia store aimed at building up its name in a new location before setting up smaller shops of different brands to reach a certain density of outlets that allows it to create economies of scale and boost profit margins for a company which spends very little on advertising its shops have always been its principal marketing tool so many are purpose built to look like fashion boutiques

3546474 an increasingly large part of the signal is becoming due to human activity

3546628 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

3546630 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3546631 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply

3546635 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3546636 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3546637 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3546638 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3546639 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

3546651 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3546652 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3546675 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
3546676 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the cap was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats such as far left udall and far right goldwater since its inception
3546677 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance

3546688 it is truly rare these days to find someone who really cares about giving their very best in service to their customer obviously autonation hires the cream of the crop and assures that the people dealing with prospective buyers know the business and actually care about serving their customers there are way too many car dealerships who are nightmares to the buyer and people in general dread the purchaseof a new or used vehicle because of the vultures they encounter we had just that experience with another dealership and their buying program through another major company we had made it perfectly clear that we were dealing with two buying programs and would choose the vehicle and the buying program based on finding what we wanted and also obtaining the best possible deal

3546703 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3546704 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3546705 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3546706 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3546707 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3546708 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3546709 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3546710 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3546711 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3546712 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3546713 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3546714 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3546715 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3546716 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

3546720 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
3546721 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

3546723 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3546724 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3546725 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3546726 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3546727 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3546728 this is the chemistry we need on the court you have to trust that your teammate has your back
3546729 and i think to my self what a wonderblu world
3546730 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3546731 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3546732 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3546733 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3546734 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3546735 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3546736 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3546737 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3546738 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3546739 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3546740 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3546741 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3546742 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3546743 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3546744 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3546745 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3546746 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3546747 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3546748 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3546749 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3546750 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3546751 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3546752 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3546753 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3546754 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3546755 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3546756 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3546757 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3546758 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3546759 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3546760 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3546761 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3546762 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3546763 i need to go to the store to buy some band aids i read an article about how expensive aids drugs are people take too many street drugs the streets should be clean from the rain today etc
3546764 we would like to have more open source applications on the maemo platform and giving these devices to the kde developers will help them write those besides its great to give to the foss community we have used foss software and products for a long time and have just began to contribute back both in terms of code and sponsorship we realize our infrastructure depends on foss developers to grow and we wanted to emphasize our commitment to the foss community after all we definitely are the largest mobile devices manufacturer who considers foss a key asset and were heavily expanding our involvement focussing more on the qt development community
3546765 many kde hackers have been interested in developing applications for the maemo platform and now they can we welcome the maemo community to work with us on getting the power of kde available to the maemo users
3546766 there are some gaps in my recollection of the past i always assumed that was sleep
3546767 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3546768 he said he did it for the adrenaline rush for the challenge

3546771 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3546772 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3546773 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3546774 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3546775 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

3546782 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos

3546785 i love all yall i forgive all yall see yall when you get there
3546786 hes very smart very organized he just was always headed in this direction every day he was looking to hurt someone it was the only satisfaction he got in life
3546787 the question is whether he was too tall to be the person in that video that basically was the defense the physical evidence showed it was not him regardless of what he said
3546788 he got away with it a long time because technology hadnt caught up to him
3546789 you hate to see that knowing that potentially if the technology had been as good when the crime was committed someone else would not have been killed
3546790 ive done cut folks ive done stabbed folks ive killed folks
3546791 hed walk down the street with a sawed off shotgun tied to his arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open just to see the reaction of people
3546792 come and i will tell you a tale like none you have ever heard
3546793 el objetivo de la operaci n para imponer la paz se ha cumplido la seguridad de las tropas de paz y de los ciudadanos rusos est garantizada
3546794 el objetivo de la operaci n para imponer la paz se ha cumplido la seguridad de las tropas de paz y de los ciudadanos rusos est garantizada
3546795 aplastar en caso de que surjan cualquier foco de resistencia o de agresi n
3546796 el agresor ha sido castigado y ha sufrido bajas significativas sus fuerzas armadas han quedado desorganizadas
3546797 no significa que las tropas rusas no vayan a realizar actividades militares de otro tipo como exploraci n
3546798 est n ardiendo la universidad y la oficina de correos
3546799 controlamos ya la mayor parte de los altos del desfiladero de kodori
3546800 la guerra no terminar hasta que salga el ltimo ocupante
3546801 no ten amos la intenci n de sacrificar a nuestros soldados y por eso nos reagrupamos
3546802 la declaraci n del cese de la hostilidades por parte de rusia es una noticia que esper bamos es una buena noticia
3546803 garantizar la soberan a integridad territorial y seguridad de georgia
3546804 es completamente normal que rusia quiera defender los intereses de sus compatriotas en su pa s y los de los ruso parlantes fuera de sus fronteras
3546805 the bond vigilantes took law and order in their own hands and pushed yields up which would slow down the economy and bring down inflation
3546806 this time the bond credit vigilantes are refusing to go into the saloon and start drinking what wall streets financial engineers are mixing
3546807 it appears that every time we peel away this onion there is another layer
3546808 to the extent that home prices keep spiraling down the need for capital keeps increasing
3546809 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3546810 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3546811 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3546812 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3546813 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3546814 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3546815 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3546816 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
3546817 this is perfectly legal these are simply people taking advantage of what the law allows
3546818 theres a huge gulf between the money a company makes and what under the tax code is deemed to be the actual amount of income subject to taxes
3546819 as a u s based company we comply with regulation and we do indeed pay corporate taxes
3546820 we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3546821 in describing 2005 a year in which corporate income tax collections rose dramatically at the state and federal levels the gao report is completely consistent with what youd expect almost all firms that were profitable reported paying taxes
3546822 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3546823 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3546824 americans spent 10 times as much on imported oil in the month of june than all the investment in new u s ethanol producing capacity for the entirety of 2007
3546825 oil imports also accounted for 80 percent our 56 8 billion trade deficit for the month
3546826 one of the largest impediments to job growth in indiana is the cost of health care all too often employers both large and small are being forced to choose between hiring more employees or staying open and keeping up with the rising cost of health insurance premiums
3546827 this is a choice they should never have to make
3546828 this is not only an issue of our citizens health its become a significant economic issue as well the cost of health care has clearly become a drag on our economy
3546829 as more and more people find themselves uninsured as we are seeing all across the state costs continue go up and the problem gets worse
3546830 we have a real opportunity to make some meaningful reforms that will not only provide more hoosiers with health insurance they will remove economic barriers and allow indiana to stand out from the competition
3546831 this approach is really a win win for everyone concerned
3546832 dennie and i are totally committed to turning this economy around and addressing the health care crisis will be a major part of our efforts
3546833 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3546834 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3546835 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3546836 old times cnn his country is seeking details on what started the fighting united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3546837 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3546838 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3546839 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3546840 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3546841 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3546842 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3546843 i dont think people want government buildings to be grand
3546844 they are paying for it and all those amenities add costs
3546845 come on folks were suburban bedroom communities with a smattering of offices and shopping plazas
3546846 lets give up spending tax money to aggrandize our communities to say were better than you are we have a more elegant city hall
3546847 weve got an upscale neighborhood all around it and hopefully an upscale retail area
3546848 youre putting up show buildings like that and youre telling me spending needs to be cut on the county level
3546849 the architect came back with a grand building full of stone and glass all around and all of us looked at that and said this is a jail we dont want an ugly building in the middle of a residential area but it doesnt need to look like a grand palace we took out fancy stone and a glass roof that couldnt be modified if needed to add a pod on top thats the approach i take to government buildings
3546850 it is very nice now but there were things taken out of it
3546851 all those skylights were an expense but standing in there it adds a lot to the facility
3546852 but i think people are finally seeing that having nice buildings does build civic pride and when professionals decide where to live they will drive around and see whether a city invests in its infrastructure places that do spend a little bit more portray that better
3546853 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces
3546854 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
3546855 women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol related problems compared with men which may be due to women turning to drinking as a whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk taking behaviors
3546856 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which has asked for more time to reflect
3546857 if it means staying in this country for 6 months i will do that
3546858 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3546859 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3546860 yes we remain committed to dialogue but we want a fair power sharing arrangement
3546861 we will now have to go back to the people and explain our position they can go ahead and form their government we made our position clear that this issue is now in the hands of the facilitator
3546862 the president has said they have not collapsed and that is the position
3546863 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3546864 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3546865 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3546866 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3546867 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3546868 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3546869 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3546870 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3546871 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3546872 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3546873 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3546874 why are people waving flags its not as if we won
3546875 i wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia
3546876 my read was that the westerners felt shame in those situations but they were inhibiting those responses and i think that is supported by the blind findings
3546877 in american and other western cultures were taught from a very early age not to show shame its stigmatized whereas in the east its appropriate to show shame in a major olympic failure for instance
3546878 with pride the original function may have been actually if i make myself larger that tells others im someone to watch out for
3546879 over the course of evolution humans would acquire the innate propensity to associate this display with success
3546880 there are many times where its not that adaptive to show shame essentially youre saying i just screwed up
3546881 but if you really feel yourself weaker than an adversary and you could convey that that you agree youre more powerful than me i submit to you dont hurt me and we both save resources compared to if we had to fight my guess is thats why its still around
3546882 here are people who have never seen people express this
3546883 the only possible explanation you could make is well maybe their parents physically move their bodies in this way to teach them
3546884 given the specificity of the response were not just talking about a simple arm stretch but chest expansion and shoulders pulling back and everything to me that seems like a less parsimonious suggestion than it being innate
3546885 primatologists have found that chimps show an inflated display when the alpha chimp is about to fight he puffs his shoulders and walks in a cocky gate
3546886 submission displays have been documented that involve cowering lowering of the body
3546887 thats pretty similar to hunching the shoulders and the shame display but theres a difference between these anecdotal observations and an empirical study no ones coded a bunch of chimps and seen what are the exact behaviors you see in these situations
3546888 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3546889 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3546890 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3546891 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3546892 we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3546893 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3546894 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3546895 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3546896 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
3546897 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3546898 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3546899 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3546900 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3546901 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise
3546902 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world
3546903 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3546904 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3546905 were trying to support parents in turning off the distractions and connecting with children
3546906 the research shows that children who eat five or more meals with their families are less likely to be involved in risky behaviors
3546907 who would have thought that doing something as simple as eating meals together as a family could have such a profound effect on families
3546908 the main purpose is to sit down with your family have a meal and connect
3546909 its a challenge to find a time when everybody can sit down and eat regardless of whether its a takeout meal or home cooked
3546910 so the challenge is to sit down together and eat a meal and talk to each other without the distractions of tv or cell phones or texting
3546911 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3546912 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3546913 sorry i thought you were conversant in hebrew 9 0 ill tell you what just stop at the fifth commandment
3546914 listen heres my guarantee if your new heart doesnt make the rest of your chest cavity feel like a million bucks you can return it within 30 days
3546915 a lighthearted approach to the most awesome the most deadly the most dangerous process that man has ever conceived
3546916 when we six months ago discovered this field called the haynesville in northwestern louisiana subsequent drilling leads us to believe that this is the fourth largest gas field in the world and probably the largest gas field in the united states by a big number
3546917 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3546918 today is a joke no agenda no bill no plan
3546919 were already hearing rumors of other moves and i think this is just as important as the next one or the one after that
3546920 i think its obvious that this is what this commission was formed for to take a look at the economic impact and i think they spoke overwhelmingly
3546921 does this decision legally inject or confirm what the administration does to the point where it can stop the administration from doing it according to the law the answer is no
3546922 however given the overwhelming volume of evidence that we heard on the economic and legal issues associated with this proposal i personally think it would be unwise and contrary to the publics interest
3546923 we will be moving forward with the geographic relocation of idots division of traffic safety to harrisburg as previously mentioned well be working with the employees who do not choose to relocate within the terms of their contracts to find positions for them in springfield we will follow all appropriate timelines and guidelines as we move forward
3546924 the facts of the case point heavily towards the commissions recommendation ultimately if the executive branch chooses to go in a different direction there may be someone who takes an exception with that
3546925 it should not be my decision as to how much i am compensated
3546926 state government is in shambles nothing is getting done its just not the time for anyone in state government to get a pay increase
3546927 this stuff will crawl away unless you nail it down first
3546928 were excited to release all four seasons of entourage on itunes allowing new and existing fans to prepare themselves for the premiere of season five
3546929 its not really where my career goals are focused right now
3546930 im really looking down the line pretty far and this might be a step backwards
3546931 you know steve sanders lives on in our hearts and in our minds
3546932 i think that its fantastic theyre trying to recapture some of the excitement that 90210 brought to a decade
3546933 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3546934 the whispered allegations about john edwards were an open secret that was debated in every newsroom and reported by almost none
3546935 in the latter stages of this case it made them look clueless
3546936 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3546937 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3546938 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3546939 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3546940 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3546941 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3546942 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3546943 irhabi hate airplanes but they would have been more effective hating on wharves
3546944 would not be in the best interest of the community
3546945 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3546946 were still investigating the case we have discovered so far that seven male teenagers have become his victims he said
3546947 most of them acknowledged that they were all coming to the house to play pool at first then after the game they were asked to watch some porno movies before they ended in the bedroom police spokesman made sudirsa said
3546948 this is not a pedophile case as currently depicted in the media according to philips statement all of the teenagers are actually male prostitutes who are trying to blackmail him over some jealousy issue lawyer ketut suartana said

3546953 as president i will ensure that federal law enforcement agencies set a good example for the rest of the country
3546954 in a barr administration government officials will never forget that it is a free people they are protecting
3546955 we dont claim that sooner or later we will all become heterosexuals
3546956 although i can see that youre very much into the gay lifestyle now
3546957 these cases become vehicles for rules to be established but we lose sight of whats profoundly human in them and they ultimately become abstractions
3546958 i think the plates are an attempt to engage the drama or the humanity not just the rule its more soulful than the study of these rules
3546959 law school is all about making the everyday obscure you take a comprehensible situation where someone is wronged by someone else and law school makes it inaccessible to the common citizen
3546960 the plate is the opposite you can pick up a plate and hold it its an everyday object that everyone understands and knows how to use
3546961 its a kids medium it was less intimidating to get into it
3546962 also i like the idea of the extraordinary work of the court intersecting with the very ordinary act of eating everyone eats
3546963 a great slideshow is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3546964 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3546965 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3546966 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3546967 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3546968 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3546969 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3546970 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3546971 you cannot ask a rahul dravid sachin tendulkar sourav ganguly vvs laxman or anil kumble to prove their credentials
3546972 i think you should ask the selectors and the bcci this question i am happy with whatever they have in mind
3546973 i think it is just with time we should start winning in odis consistently we are a great team and we start doing well pretty soon
3546974 australia as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one
3546975 everyone has to improve we have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best
3546976 not at all a player can be good in odis and tests and 20 20 as well look at virender sehwag or gautam gambhir

3546981 everyone has to improve we have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best
3546982 not at all a player can be good in odis and tests and 20 20 as well look at virender sehwag or gautam gambhir
3546983 the process is on course and a lot of ground has been covered

3546987 take care of yourself the complete guide to medical self care
3546988 the fact that theyve been able to develop a polymer type material that can be used in a relatively thin film is worth a second look compared with previous ceramic heatsinks that worked the same way
3546989 also its working in a temperature range that is of interest to us

3546998 thousands of people will send her songs for this album her manager will hand her between 30 and 80 im guessing then its intangible what shell connect with maybe its as simple as a single word in the title that matches her mood that morning
3546999 im o give it to u like a baby gets a bottle
3547000 move u body let it go just like u just lost control
3547001 lately ive been fascinated by how much your hit is supposed to resemble existing hits
3547002 ive been told to make something resemble another song and it turned out they wanted it very similar but of course you cant come too close
3547003 with some obvious exceptions theres no money coming from album sales anymore so artists are aware that tv is one of the only options these days or a coke commercial or an ipod commercial
3547004 that old idea of selling out just isnt a relevant critique anymore
3547005 others say it should have the fewest number of notes
3547006 i like that in the present we can all enjoy the same song that we all know
3547007 and in the future we can come together over nostalgia for that song like when you hear rock lobster nowadays
3547008 i was just never sure if a certain idea would sell vodka or not
3547009 jumping off the wheel of american protestant work ethic and consumer culture the wheel that says you must always be doing always be achieving always be motivated
3547010 so many people try to get what you have and you got it without trying a day in your life
3547011 i told myself there will be days when i dont do anything at all and thats fine i wanted to see what would happen
3547012 its embarrassing to admit but i dont have an answer for what i did on an average day most days i got up and wondered what i would do its an anxious way to start the day
3547013 a lot of days i wouldnt get out of bed id just read i liked to joke that i was the only person in the united states who read the new yorker every week cover to cover
3547014 all that free time you should take up bluegrass guitar
3547015 get in really good shape dont just go to the gym sometimes like the rest of us but become a real athlete join the city tennis league take regular yoga classes and fitness classes play basketball theres time to become an adonis you know of course youd have to find other athletes with the same kind of free time to play with but you can figure that out later
3547016 why not start going to the zen center really get into that community get centered
3547017 become one of those people who has a bar where they know you you walk in and they say hi all it takes is a little time and thatll happen
3547018 be an explorer just pick a different neighborhood each day and really get to know it intimately be one of those guys who can tell people go check out petes he makes a good reuben or whatever
3547019 be a really good friend go help people who are at home with their new babies they get sort of lonely you know when was the last time you went and spent time with gaby
3547020 museums get out there and see stuff be one of those guys who knows about the latest exhibitions
3547021 work on your web site you dont even have a web site do you
3547022 i started to make up little projects i got chickens so id have something to tend to
3547023 turns out chickens are really self sufficient dont need that much tending so id take the dog for massive three hour walks
3547024 there was the distinct feeling of vacation even though it was a weeknight he was so relaxed and it was really compelling to have that groundedness
3547025 i came out of this diy culture in washington but it turned out i didnt have the d or the i i had all this free time but no real motivating feeling or direction
3547026 i was trying not to judge myself but were so inculcated with a need for achievement we need a way to measure how our lives are going and if youre not doing anything wheres the scale
3547027 but i think one of the reasons we work so well is that i have a calmness that comes from lack of ambition
3547028 by the time we were planning our wedding i was thinking gosh there sure is a lot to do
3547029 but i also didnt want to corrupt that relaxed side of him who wants to put a leash on a butterfly so i would just sort of leave these to do lists lying around
3547030 i sort of realized im a sheep i need a shepherd
3547031 i see unchecked ambition as coming from neurosis but in this culture not having ambition might exact an equivalent toll
3547032 i dont have that kind of ambition that makes people anxious or competitive people dont feel theyve got to beat me at anything or get the jump on me or network with me i dont know anybody that can help you so people find they can just relax with me
3547033 i remember thinking im going to do nothing today im going to buy a bag of cheetos that was very decadent for me and do nothing but watch basketball well i did it and i was so incredibly bored
3547034 i lucked into this profession just like i lucked into a lot of things i could be working at mcdonalds back in topeka thats another place people wind up if they dont have ambition
3547035 its another reason peoples jobs cant define who they are there are too many crappy jobs out there and not enough crappy people
3547036 dana itu akan dikirimkan oleh otoritas palestina mahmoud abbas untuk membayar gaji orang orang abbas
3547037 just open your f bag and dont give us a hard time
3547038 i am opening my bag i was just asking a question
3547039 id like to have had some great cutting reply for him then gone inside and laughed it off with my friends
3547040 but that kind of thing doesnt happen to me often and i was just sort of stunned and of course it connects with a history of painful stuff i went in and found my friends but pretty soon just had to get out of there i didnt even look at the guys on my way out
3547041 im not big into playing victim but this just felt like straight up baiting
3547042 the ethical expectations in a business are much more strict than in your personal life
3547043 one could argue that the only way the bar will succeed is if they maintain their identity customers should understand a business purpose and shouldnt undermine it
3547044 on the other hand how that is communicated is another matter entirely everyone must be welcome if i were manager id tell my security i want everyone at that door to feel valued as a human being
3547045 regardless of the intent of the bouncer most reasonable people could understand the impact of the comment as being demeaning of the persons masculinity
3547046 it sounds discriminatory but its not clear what its discriminating against
3547047 maybe its looks ism it could be youre too straight for a gay bar or too gay for a straight bar or too rich for a poor bar this ones such a gray area
3547048 we all know where we want to go with this stuff its just getting there thats the challenge
3547049 to be creative in the kitchen or anywhere you cant be depleted all the time
3547050 and thats whats ironic about working in a restaurant its just totally depleting
3547051 i can take time to think read cookbooks in the morning write take a walk every day all in a rural place
3547052 ive become more patient coaxing out the flavor in things this needs to brown more saying its ok to wait for that to happen
3547053 ive done a lot of braises this year really browning that stew meat same with rice timbale and with quiche dont be scared of drying it out let it go longer
3547054 balancing the sweetness with the saltiness with the acidity requires some attention now i get those macerated shallots in the vinegar 15 minutes beforehand and it makes all the difference
3547055 flavors get compromised when youre caught in traffic on the way from your doctors appointment and youd wanted to swing by the cheese board but now theres no time
3547056 one thing ive gotten here is confidence to be uncompromised in making things taste good
3547057 now cooking for 27 people isnt such a big deal
3547058 i like this salad for its assertive flavors if you wish add shavings of an aged cheese to the dressed salad piave a cows milk cheese or pecorino toscana a sheeps milk cheese would be delicious
3547059 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3547060 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists mr sarkozy said at a news conference in the georgian capital tbilisi
3547061 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3547062 future status of two rebel zones in georgia was cut from the peace plan they said with talks to focus instead on how to ensure
3547063 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace mr medvedev told defence chiefs at a meeting on the south ossetia conflict though he warned any attacks by georgia would be
3547064 stands for the territorial integrity of georgia and backed its democratically elected government
3547065 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3547066 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for shouted ukrainian president viktor yushchenko in live pictures carried by georgian television
3547067 alleged acts of ethnic cleansing between 1993 and 2008 starting with the period when russian peacekeepers entered georgias breakaway regions
3547068 the crown prosecution service has discontinued proceedings said judge timothy workman at westminster magistrates court in central london
3547069 it is not a matter in which the court has any control or authority the matter is now discontinued
3547070 i do find that result extremely surprising and it reminds me of the 19th century legal comment in england justice is open to all just like the ritz he said
3547071 deeply saddened by the events leading up to their arrests and vowed to help the couple overcome their addictions
3547072 the joy of sex a gourmet guide to love making
3547073 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3547074 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
3547075 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
3547076 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
3547077 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
3547078 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience
3547079 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3547080 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3547081 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3547082 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3547083 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3547084 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation

3547093 there is no better case for dam removal on the west coast than the four small obsolete and fish killing dams in the klamath river that currently block the river
3547094 by far the best way to restore the klamath based salmon fisheries for northern california and southern oregon would be to remove these dams they have long since outlived their usefulness and today they are nothing more than an ongoing disaster for large portions of the west coast and its salmon
3547095 dam removal is a win win for pacificorps customers and for commercial fishermen from newport to san francisco and we hope to send that message loud and clear on the september 18th day of action
3547096 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute

3547100 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences
3547101 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity

3547103 council is spending over a 1 000 000 on the works which will transform bold street between seymour and laurie streets
3547104 this is a project the community has been wanting for a number of years and it is pleasing the works are finally underway
3547105 the upgrade works will ensure significant access improvements are made particularly for older people and people with disabilities mr finlay said
3547106 all members at the sites left are feeling very concerned about their job security working for boral
3547107 workers in these mills thought that the spending would mean a certain amount of job security but that doesnt seem to be a factor in borals decision to close
3547108 its a concern that public money can be spent assisting businesses and then a decision to close a mill can be made by a business in receipt of this money
3547109 under the wood supply agreement contract the company has allocation of approximately 22 000 cubic metres of logs per annum that would be the potential amount of freight crossing that road
3547110 were seeking to apply pressure to boral to reverse its decision on walcha the nsw government as custodian of the timber supply need to give boral an ultimatum on walcha or surrender the agreement
3547111 if boral is allowed to get away with transferring the timber elsewhere clearly the government needs to revisit the contract agreement with the timber industry and the purpose of it to provide job security

3547541 the city is simply too small to support and sustain two full service private hospitals

3547543 in essence no provincial centre in new zealand has been able to sustain more than one private surgical hospital and palmerston north is no exception
3547544 this position is unsustainable its shareholders can now earn considerably more money with the value of their shares on term deposit than invested in aorangi
3547545 we stand by the statement that palmerston north is too small to sustain the two hospitals and that the logical thing is to merge
3547546 each bin costs 550 a year to be emptied if they have to be emptied more often that penalises everyone else

3547610 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3547611 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3547612 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3547613 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3547614 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert

3547629 with strong support from key existing shareholders we believe we are close to securing the additional financing that will provide identiphi the capital for longer term stability and put us on the road toward profitability in addition to our efforts to secure additional financing we have successfully reached an agreement with key ovation to extend the maturity date of our secured promissory note until the end of october
3547630 since coming on board ive spent time speaking with identiphi employees and partners analyzing identiphis technology and market position and performing a critical review of our sales opportunities what i see is a company with a dedicated team and the right ingredients which i believe is poised for strong growth under experienced leadership we have innovative biometric and security solutions strong relationships with our customers and partners and most importantly a solid pipeline of sales opportunities as a veteran and active participant in the industry both internationally and in the us i have seen first hand how the interest in biometrics and authentication solutions is increasing globally i do believe however that the biometric industry is still an emerging market that has proven to be unpredictable and dynamic but i feel my experience will help us take advantage of the best opportunities for success and growth

3547712 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3547713 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attack withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world world history is often made in remote obscure countries it is being made in georgia today it is the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure that history continues to be a record of humanitys progress toward respecting the values and security of free people

3548152 the vancouver police department carries out far more vulgar illegal evictions on a monthly basis as part of their committment to social cleansing in the lead up to the olympic games
3548153 the difference here that makes what i did criminal is that it was in a west end office instead of an east side apartment and we werent wearing uniforms
3548154 these arent activists theyre not protesters these are people intent on coming to events to offices to peoples residences and theyre intent on breaking the law
3548155 other than the fact that you dont have 92 telling you exactly what is coming and what to expect there really isnt much difference this year
3548156 it isnt like its a new position for me im a starter now thats it
3548157 im just going to build on what we established last year and continue getting better
3548158 maybe i am baiting some offensive co ordinators not to double team me right now
3548159 honestly i am the new guy on the block but i feel i am going to go out there and give whoever tries to block me a long night
3548160 we have everything in already that we are going to throw at people
3548161 its a lot of the same things but we have more twists to them it will be a little more complex but we are ready for that now we can make a lot of the calls he is making
3548162 we were angry that detroit scored on the first drive and i like that
3548163 there are 11 guys on the football field for a reason and we all have to play as one when one doesnt thats when you get the big plays and you dont play your best defence
3548164 we did not question the pills because in gdr times you were expected to trust your coaches
3548165 nobody thought is this dangerous for me the coaches said the pills were important to keep us fit and healthy i did not even consider the possibility that they might be harmful we were doing incredibly tough power training so i thought that was the reason i was growing more muscles and strength
3548166 i had no sympathy with my body it had changed beyond all recognition
3548167 it was as though they had killed heidi becoming andreas was the next logical step

3548170 projection man allows our artists to quickly project a painting onto geometry in a scene simplifying even the most complex setups which can be easily organized within a single photoshop file
3548171 we are pleased that maxon has created the cineman connection to pixars renderman directly from within cinema 4d
3548172 now maxon customers can benefit from pixars academy award winning rendering technology featured in ratatouille the incredibles and many others
3548173 our customers told us what they needed and we listened
3548174 this exciting new version is as ideal for the novice as it is for the power user who wants to produce compelling imagery in todays fast paced environments
3548175 in the end i think things will be revealed it will be clearer what happened my differences with ruud have been well documented
3548176 players need to understand whether you like the coach or not the only reason youre here is ruud wanted you and alexi wanted you once theyre gone all bets are off
3548177 a lot of people were maybe waiting for something like this to happen which is not necessarily the best scenario the best scenario is to turn things around because that guarantees youll be part of it
3548178 waiting for things to get to the point theyve got to now theres such uncertainty i hope we can do a good job of keeping it out of the group theres blood in the water now and teams know it maybe guys are a little bit more comfortable with jones as coach but in the end i dont know whether it was a comfort issue its very difficult to adjust in the way a club has been going over such a quick period of time so i think there was conflict and i think specifically alexi and ruud will probably answer that better than i
3548179 his personality as a coach was very different from what a lot of us were used to and he wasnt used to us and it was a tough blend i read a quote from him yesterday that said the job was tougher than he anticipated it was going to be when he came in at the end of the day it just wasnt the right fit when we started to get on a little bit of a slide and things didnt work out for his family it was time for him to move on
3548180 as things have gotten ill use ruuds word unstable the more unstable they get the better cobi seems to get hes taken on a persona and a personality that ive never seen before hes always one that got it done and people followed he wasnt the most vocal person in the world he just did his work its his club and if he doesnt take ownership of it who will nobody in the entire world has more right to say what should be done than cobi jones
3548181 ill have to take it to his grave then my father passed away earlier this year i just wanted to have it signed for him as a reminder of him

3548218 im convinced from talking to her that shes been grossly overcharged
3548219 she did not in any way initiate or cause the death of her son and we are going to i think have a very easy time proving that

3548221 i guess its still pretty high but its better than what it was
3548222 thats a decrease of 21 percent gas prices have only gone down 11 percent so were seeing oil prices drop almost twice as fast as gas prices
3548223 its really starting to look like the markets were deliberately gamed high on global oil markets earlier this year and that these prices were artificially created

3548226 bread fortified with modest amounts of folic acid and vitamin b12 will improve folate and vitamin b12 status and a considerable proportion of vitamin b12 deficiency in older people
3548227 may also be good for those sections of the populations that are known to have compromised vitamin b12 status such as vegetarians breastfed infants and in particular the elderly up to 15 per cent of whom suffer from food cobalamin malabsorption
3548228 in relation to folic acid fortification it was recognized that ntds were rare but at the time those in favour focused on the huge
3548229 the situation is rather different for vitamin b 12 fortification where the scale of the problem is potentially much greater including not only a significant proportion of the elderly but also some infants and young children with low vitamin b 12 status
3548230 furthermore there is perhaps less concern about adverse effects with this vitamin than there was with folic acid however we must remember that evidence of benefit and of lack of harm is always needed before introducing mandatory population level exposures to nutrients

3548236 i was freaking out because all the big athletes were coming up to me and wanted photos with me
3548237 and when the australians came out they came over in a big group to us
3548238 this reflects our belief that the company can maintain appropriate credit metrics and financial flexibility for the rating category
3548239 everybody wants to go to the olympics you know if you cant go as an athlete lets find another way
3548240 they are normal folks just like all of us their training room there was just like my training room at minot state or minot high those athletes have the same problems i didnt have to write any phy ed excuses that was probably the biggest difference
3548241 ive got 2 3 tvs going and computers going and i feel like im missing something all the time so its been difficult
3548242 its good to see them do well to be able to perform you know when i saw them they still hadnt gone through the trials yet a lot of them so to see them be able to attain that get to where they want to go and then do well has just been a joy
3548243 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3548244 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3548245 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3548246 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3548247 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3548248 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3548249 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3548250 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3548251 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3548252 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3548253 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3548254 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3548255 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all
3548256 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

3548274 we have the ten year liability period which means in those ten years we have to show that the reclaimed land meets or exceeds the premined land
3548275 the piece we are standing on right here was just bond released here in june it is a hundred ninty acre tract
3548276 we are in that cycle of maturity if you will in mining where we are starting to see an accelerated effort to have final bond release not only on more segments of former mine land or predisturbed mine land but larger sections of that
3548277 when we take the top soil and respread it it often times gets spread more evenly than it was previously you know nature doesnt do it perfectly but here man with its machines tends to
3548278 its a surprise because we all know about the increasing costs of living like higher interest rates groceries and the cost of petrol
3548279 we had a flood in february and we recorded significant movements down the river and then back up again after that event
3548280 that kind of data gives us an idea as to why the fish are moving to where they are
3548281 we hope it will prompt people to think about the importance of maintaining these valuable pieces of our maritime heritage
3548282 the viability of which would be improved if it could link into a vft link to sydney and canberra
3548283 whilst it seems a very feasible idea im not sure the community would support it
3548284 its the night of stellas first date with the med student stephen dallas they go and see the latest kim novak picture what sounds like a huge
3548285 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3548286 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3548287 i really dont know why michelle continues to do this
3548288 we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men we all have different agendas in life
3548289 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on the being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
3548290 the comments i havent them or read them i dont really care actually
3548291 people will have their opinion about me and obviously a couple of various criticisms or compliments will come my way and i may hear about them or i may accidentally read about them but id rather them have opinions about me than not have opinions about me so thats just the way it is
3548292 i dont listen to them i listen to the people that are close to me and i respect
3548293 but in the end everything comes down to my decision
3548294 michelle is a very talented young athlete that has unbelievable potential
3548295 its unfortunate the way things have gone for michelle in the last little while but michelle is a talent we need that talent on our tour she brings a lot of people out to watch her
3548296 you know i hope for michelle that she can continue being a kid at stanford and ill be selfish to say a good and important part of our tour
3548297 the year was inconsistent ive kind of had my ups and downs but i feel my game has gotten better over the summer
3548298 i feel as though ive and i dont know really how to say it but ive just kind of learned how to be patient with myself and how to just try and accept things and try not to be as perfect and just enjoy the game again
3548299 right now im too involved with me playing this summer to be thinking about the future
3548300 their normal contact drill is that as soon as they get hit with something then its 360 open up on anything that moves
3548301 obviously they are not playing in the premier league like we are but they can still play football and on a bad day for us if we are not concentrating then we can lose to a side like fh hafnarfjardar so we must be careful and take this game seriously we took odense seriously in the intertoto cup and that is how we should always be

3548355 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3548356 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3548357 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3548358 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3548359 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3548360 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3548371 son las cajas de cart n donde se guardan los archivadores que se han pintado con plantillas que simulan ser una tape
3548372 son obras nicas que no se comercializa nicamente se exhiben en la exposici n
3548373 todo lo que sea acercar a la gente de a pie est bien lo que pasa es que el graffiti ya est cerca de la gente pues no hay nada m s cercano que salir a la calle y encontrarte una pieza le va a costar m s a la gente venir aqu que ir a la calle verlo
3548374 para nosotros es un lujo estar pintando en este tipo de superficies en un edificio hist rico
3548375 realmente la gente sabe que esto es una obra que estamos exponiendo pero en realidad estamos exponiendo muchos d as al a o en la calle y son obras que a lo mejor duran un d a nada m s

3548420 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3548421 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3548422 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3548423 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3548424 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3548443 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3548444 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another

3548514 my discomfort arises from both my inability to get words out and my articulation that will improve but not for now
3548515 i think the real reason is number one not to give me the exposure the debates would have allowed and secondly really to protect him from close scrutiny of his record
3548516 i will defend my positions more fully than i can in a debate i will encourage back and forth and the response i make will be good or bad
3548517 theres going to kind of be virtual debate in the media and so forth and some kind of battle of tv ads which i think is unfortunate because you get sort of pre packaged sound bites and scripted bits of information and you dont really get to see the real candidates and the real people
3548518 breast cancer is a common cancer in this country its a cancer that needs lots of different expertise
3548519 when all these people get together we come up with a better plan
3548520 first stop of the day was a mammogram and that showed a problem
3548521 i think thats pretty awesome to know that that many people bring their minds together to find the best possible treatment for each individual case because each case is different
3548522 they want you to survive and theyre going to do everything within their power to do that
3548523 cancer patients deserve to have this effort by the whole health care team to come together in a consensus to get multiple opinions to get the best treatments for patients
3548524 one day at a time thats how we live our life one day at a time
3548525 we will be able to help students see the application of science engineering mathematics collecting data and being a part in the renewable energy source project for south dakota
3548526 south dakota being a state that has plenty of wind to show students what our state is doing
3548527 and we get to be a partner in that is absolutely what were looking for
3548528 for instance the lowell math science technology specialty school would be a perfect partner and player in the project
3548529 we saw an increased risk in newly reported heavy weekly drinking newly reported binge drinking and newly reported alcohol related problems
3548530 our findings showed that the individuals who deployed and reported combat exposures were at increased risk for newly reported alcohol behaviors
3548531 our goal was to give answers to the leadership and let them take these answers and refine our policy and prevention strategies
3548532 we serve over 160 to 180 families a month so well have a months supply of beds for sure so maybe we can make it last 6 weeks but thats what we need every month
3548533 they are able to go to school having a had a good nights rest sleeping on a bed and not a floor
3548534 if you have to take the bus that means we have to deliver the furniture and so thats part of our ministry
3548535 any type of vigorous exercise will likely do the trick said stanfords dr james fries who worked on the study
3548536 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3548537 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important

3548539 consumers must remain vigilant in the midst of the national mortgage crisis
3548540 there are unscrupulous individuals seeking to take advantage of homeowners who have worked hard their whole lives to secure equity in their properties this settlement serves as both a victory for new yorks homeowners and a warning to all companies that they must clearly state their intentions when seeking business from unsuspecting consumers
3548541 nobody takes a minute off on the internet you have to be there every minute of the day looking and hunting for the next big story so you have to make it work for you and here i am with my laptop and my wireless card looking to break more stories before i finish my breakfast than perez does in a week
3548542 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds i m waiting she added i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive
3548543 oh you mean my pilots license thats out back in the cessna or perhaps youre referring to my license to kill revoked trouble at the kazakhstan border i could give you the details but then id have to kill you which i cant do because my license to kill has been revoked

3548552 the understated leadership of both dr drummond and dr affleck their hard work and their unwavering commitment to advocate at both the federal and provincial level in pushing for critical improvements in the emergency department are a model for others to emulate
3548553 i am deeply honoured to be recognized by my peers but far more importantly i view this award as an important acknowledgement by the profession that ed overcrowding is indeed a significant and serious public health threat that undermines the confidence of canadians in the integrity of their health care system
3548554 for most canadians their highly valued almost iconic universal health care system is all about timely access to quality care when its needed most perhaps within our life time we will see ed overcrowding relegated to being simply a historical anomaly
3548555 having worked in emergency medicine for 22 years emergency department overcrowding for me became the single most important barrier to providing proper patient care
3548556 the issue had grown to the point where the effects were experienced on literally every shift the impact affected not only ed care but admitted patients and was the main contributor to physicians and nurses leaving the ed
3548557 i enjoy the work i do and simply wanted to be an advocate for the patients and ed staff and make a contribution that would change the ed environment
3548558 while dr affleck and i may be receiving this award it really is in honour of the two thousand men and women who are canadas emergency physicians
3548559 they consistently strive to provide excellence in patient care despite overwhelming odds they inspire us
3548560 think left and think right and think low and think high oh the thinks you can think up if only you try
3548561 no nos equivocamos en el presupuesto de ning n a o
3548562 this is actually really interesting this month by my count we have 11 advisories covering 26 vulnerabilities
3548563 there were originally supposed to be 12 advisories but it appears as though the windows media player update was pulled since this was originally marked critical its not good that its pulled
3548564 its like a being given a treasure map thats half completed theres still a lot of space to cover but its significantly smaller than if you had no insight at all
3548565 also four of the 12 advisories had vulnerabilities that had already been publicly disclosed and one half of those publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are already being actively exploited
3548566 looks like summer vacation is over a little early for network security professionals after a light july the august patch tuesday will be a very busy one
3548567 the critical updates will affect both desktops and servers so it departments will need to quickly and carefully assess which patches should receive priority
3548568 the five critical patches need to get installed as soon as possible this month
3548569 all of these patches can affect client by attack vectors that are used in day to day client side computer use visiting an evil web site or by opening an evil document
3548570 continuing the ongoing trend attackers are increasingly targeting common users and tricking them into accessing a malicious web site or opening an unsolicited document
3548571 todays bulletins mostly deal with user driven applications such microsoft office including word excel powerpoint access and others such as internet explorer outlook express and windows messenger this is something people need to be aware of and prioritize more sooner than later
3548572 we are pleased to report very strong results for the second quarter of 2008
3548573 despite continued weak conditions in the us residential housing market and dramatically higher carbon rod costs our strategic initiatives together with product pricing actions helped us achieve significantly better year over year financial performance
3548574 on the top line our sales volumes were up 22 3 and revenue was 36 3 higher as we continued to benefit from last years acquisition of new asian and us operations as well as from a sharpened strategic focus in each of our five core markets
3548575 more importantly we carried our top line gains through to the bottom line a series of successful product pricing actions helped us recover the margin lost to higher raw material costs in the first quarter while keeping pace with continued carbon rod inflation through the second quarter our results were further supported by operating savings from the consolidation of our north american operations and our initial success with efforts to balance our product mix and fine tune profitability in our various markets as an example of the latter we grew sales of some of our higher margin products during the quarter including high carbon galvanized wire to the industrial oem market and welded wire fabric to the commercial construction and residential construction markets
3548576 as a result of these various initiatives we ended the quarter with very strong gross profit per ton of 230 which combined with our higher volumes resulted in dramatic improvements in our gross profit ebitda net income and distributable cash generation we were particularly pleased to end the quarter with a payout ratio of 44 and a first half payout ratio of 77
3548577 while these results are encouraging i want to emphasize that we continue to face numerous challenges carbon rod costs continue to rise transportation costs are increasing and conditions in the residential construction market remain weak in addition with our product pricing now more closely aligned to raw material costs we would expect our gross profit per ton to settle to a more sustainable level through the balance of 2008 overall however we feel we are making good progress toward our strategic objectives our expanded range of products and markets has given us significantly more flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and we are optimistic about what we can achieve as we continue to implement our step three strategic initiatives
3548578 although we are pleased with the positive impact our strategic initiatives and actions have had on our financial results we recognize that we are still operating within an extremely challenging market environment
3548579 the third step of our strategy which we began implementing earlier this year focuses on fine tuning our business so that we have the flexibility to operate effectively in this environment and can achieve more predictable growth and profitability we expect it will take the remainder of 2008 and most of 2009 to achieve the consistent optimal performance we are seeking until that time we expect to see variations in our performance given the inherent cyclicality of the market
3548580 was extremely concerned about the plight of the people at that time and how the church might help them we would discus the painting in great depth as to its meaning and my observation that the victim in the title of the work is the person in the street with no hope of resurrection
3548581 the issues then were local and national concerned with victims of social unrest unemployment and social deprivation now they are global concerned with terrorism global warming flooding famine civil war religious persecution cultural and social divide the painting expresses with passion the plight and loss of hope of those who are the victims those who do not have the power or authority to survive
3548582 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3548583 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3548584 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3548585 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3548586 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3548587 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3548588 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3548589 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3548590 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3548591 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this
3548592 presley place where the money will go we contribute to them every year
3548593 also i want that on display in my living room in a curio cabinet
3548594 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason

3548598 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3548599 he said he did it for the adrenaline rush for the challenge
3548600 these homes are not fit for anyone to live in
3548601 in the brush in the middle of nowhere on a dead end road
3548602 weve known for a while they were a little strange that they didnt want interference from the outside world but unless were down there on a call its not part of our routine patrol
3548603 jail is inappropriate for these folks but to go untreated is not the answer either
3548604 i saw him cross the road cross the green grass and i saw shrubbery and flowers
3548605 i said to him why is he going that way whats going on
3548606 i looked up and you could see the bus actually going over
3548607 when we hit it just blew us both out of the seat
3548608 we started writing new songs for this album the first week of january while simultaneously planning a mid west tour of america in february and recording our comin atcha live 2008 dvd while we were on the road coming home in march we hired terry to jump back into writing and recording music with us while we edited the dvd and routed a summer tour of europe were riding a wave of energy that doesnt come easy for a band of rookies much less a band whose been doing this for over 20 years and we wouldnt have it any other way
3548609 we jumped right back into the studio to work on forever more with terry while setting up a tour of american festival shows in july and august playing alongside bands such as matchbox twenty the wallflowers queensr che kiss and judas priest its great that we can play with any band of any music genre because weve never been pigeon holed into a style or label of music throughout our career
3548610 forever more demonstrates this idea of writing songs in a diverse fashion the title track is one of our deeper cuts complete with heavy lyrics de tuned riffs and acoustic interludes while i wanna live is one of our more uplifting songs that bounces musically and delivers a lyrical message that suggests living life to the fullest
3548611 it has to be the worst case of animal abuse in the history of vermont
3548612 as soon as you step in youre covered head to toe with fleas
3548613 shes as starved for affection as she is food she still has diarrhea
3548614 they said they didnt know why their animals were dying they were very angry we were taking the animals away from them and they didnt offer any information they simply said were taking care of them but theyre dying theres nothing we can do the response they gave was very strange
3548615 it has to be the worst case of animal abuse in the history of vermont

3548617 when congress made death valley a national park in 1994 it set aside these areas for all americans to enjoy as quiet natural and free from damaging dirt bikes atvs and other off road vehicles the courts ruling will help ensure that congresss promise to the american people will be kept
3548618 we are thrilled to bring this world class event back to the cincinnati area host of the first three national championships from 1997 through 1999
3548619 the nationals organizing committee would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to ben huffman and everyone at the warren county convention and visitors bureau without whom this event would never have come to be back in ohio
3548620 a lot of people have a reluctance to buy produce when they cant identify where it comes from or if it was handled properly throughout the process
3548621 a lot of people feel that if you can shake the hand of the farmer who grows your food you can be surer of its safety
3548622 theres no greater love than to show people what you know
3548623 we will need the spirit of youth in abundance as the world seeks to embrace cleaner more sustainable forms of energy including renewable resources
3548624 youth should therefore be given a chance to take an active part in the decision making of local national and global levels
3548625 and they can actively support initiatives that will lead to the passage of far reaching legislation
3548626 on this international youth day i urge young people around the world to invest their energies and bright ideas into shaping a safer more sustainable planet

3548628 de acuerdo a las facultades que le otorga el c digo hizo un control de las prescripciones de instrucci n y detect dos omisiones que orden subsanar
3548629 hubo un hecho donde una persona denunci lesiones en la sede judicial y policial donde se certificaron las lesiones y est n las constancias de ingreso al hospital fue citada por la justicia pero el juez omiti indagar al se or varizat y seguir los plazos procesales para clausurar la instrucci n
3548630 previo a decretar la nulidad de la clausura de instrucci n y previo a la elevaci n que instruye ese hecho que se lo den a conocer al se or varizat para que pueda ejercer su derecho de defensa en la declaraci n indagatoria y en su caso si estima que la prueba es suficiente ordene el procesamiento y despu s la elevaci n a juicio
3548631 esto no es volver a foja cero este tr mite que orden el tribunal puede hacerse en un tiempo breve que no es un a o como dec an algunos medios todo depende de varias circunstancias pero yo calculo que en no m s de uno o dos meses se puede subsanar esa omisi n
3548632 en breve el juez de instrucci n subsana eso y puede volver antes de fin de a o para que el tribunal tramite la causa y disponga la realizaci n de la medidas procesales necesarias ya sea juicio o lo que pidan las partes
3548633 the complexity of newly engineered systems coupled with their potential impact on lives the environment etc raise a set of ethical issues that engineers had not been thinking about
3548634 our saving grace our inability to affect things at a planetary level is being lost to us
3548635 we need at least to think about what we are doing while we are doing it to be aware of the consequences of our research
3548636 it leaves the door open for people to do something that is going to cause long term problems
3548637 the question now is how best to begin that discussion among the scientists to encourage them to do something like this then figure out what would be the right mechanism who would fund it what form would recommendations take all those details
3548638 scientists and engineers should not be involved in these kinds of ethical questions
3548639 even beginning the discussion putting geoengineering on the table and beginning the scientific work could in itself make us less concerned about all the things that we need to start doing now
3548640 maladapted for situations that call for focused research to resolve societal issues that need to be faced with some urgency
3548641 the sooner there is an opportunity for public discussion the better
3548642 not well designed to handle issues that are not already in a crisis
3548643 with no grand debate over first principles and no accusations of acting in bad faith nanotechnology has received only fitful attention
3548644 well shoot anyone who gets in our way including americans

3548647 this was not just about something in a text book it was hands on learning
3548648 signifies above all else the power of collaboration our students think differently about the world as a result of your contribution

3548653 i just love this webblog and not just because my dear friend created it i have been dying to have moment to share i actually have many tickled pink moments with my children friends and family but worthy of the blog anyway today i have something to celebrate something to share a true moment i was accepted into the doctoral program for educational leadership with vcu as an educator i truly believe in being a life long learner and the power of education i will work in a cohort with other leaders from my school system i am thrilled and just to have this opportunity to grow professionally and personally wow isnt it amazing how good it feels to share special news
3548654 you cant grow grass and children at the same time
3548655 the one million mark is something weve projected to hit this year
3548656 when you put this milestone in perspective with what has happened historically it is astounding to see that we reached the million clicks in just 31 days in july when back in 2004 those same number of clicks took a full calendar year to realize its clear to us that consumers whether they are shopping for an apartment or airline tickets or any other purchase go online specifically searching for concrete information they can use immediately to make decisions that was the exact premise that drove the development of vaultware when it was launched in 2003
3548657 israel is following with great concern the developments in south ossetia and abkhazia and hopes the violence will end
3548658 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3548659 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3548660 a small group of georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire russian military division thanks to the israeli training
3548661 georgian minister tells israel radio thanks to israeli training were fending off russian military
3548662 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
3548663 internalized israeli military technique and if the special reconnaissance forces have chalked up any successes
3548664 idf vets who trained georgia troops say war with russia is no surprise
3548665 every bomb that falls on our heads is an attack on democracy on the european union and on america
3548666 the most forceful advocate in washington for u s investment
3548667 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
3548668 with the resources export market thriving retail spending in wa is still strong but the trading laws are not reflective of modern community demands for flexibility and ease of access
3548669 its incongruous that in perth consumers with cash in hand are denied the ability to shop or have a relaxing stroll through their local shopping mall on a sunday yet melbourne sydney brisbane darwin and hobart are afforded this convenience
3548670 we all live in a 24 7 economy with the requirement and expectation of flexible trading hours and convenient access to products and services in fact we would like to see a nationalisation of trading hours in this time of difficult trading any move from the government to support restrictions and red tape around trading hours is not welcomed by retailers
3548671 we call upon the wa government and the liberal opposition to allow wa consumers to enter the modern world and deregulate trading hours
3548672 oh i see so we have conjured up a large meteor now interesting well thats uniform layers up the spout it would lose matter as it hit the atmosphere but it would not break up of course and would not be drawn to the magnetic poles
3548673 the layers of the geocolumn could only happen with rapid flood sediment deposition and normal aggregate seperation some of the layers show mixing as happens in wave motion
3548674 the bible states clearly that when the flood began all the fountains of the great deep were broken up in a single day and the water came forth this great cataclysm was foretold in the names of the first ten patriarchs and noah was warned more than 100 years in advance to prepare an ark to the saving of his house
3548675 the layers of the geocolumn could only happen with rapid flood sediment deposition and normal aggregate seperation some of the layers show mixing as happens in wave motion
3548676 there is not enough subterranean water to cover the whole globe to a height of 27 000 feet
3548677 and that quote my friend summarises the dilemna that you creationists find yourself in
3548678 the water is right there in the oceans the mountains have been pushed up fossils could happen no other way than a worldwide flood what there is no evidence of is millions of years please provide some
3548679 the chalk layer was not my quote but comes from
3548680 he provided not even a pic of a transitional fossil or a link where one can be viewed
3548681 heres a whole list of alleged transitionals not a real one in the bunch just drawings kinda like what we find in the museums fake monkeys with feet and absurd whales with legs
3548682 the mt st helens volcanic flood did produce exactly what we see at the grand canyon complete with thousands of polystrate upright trees
3548683 theres not always the same material for the layers and so we have short layers non conformaties something evolution uniformitarians have no explaination for if there were millions of years between each age of the geo column they should be the same all over the planet but they are not the geological column is another textbook fiction
3548684 im not interested in opinions i want lab testable scientific fact as how these happened if it is your opinion that everything was just a bunch of local floods over millions of years science doesnt support your opinion for the stated reasons there is no erosion there are polystrate fossils there is a universal chalk layer the best youve come up with so far is to deny they even exist
3548685 the water is right there in the oceans the mountains have been pushed up fossils could happen no other way than a worldwide flood what there is no evidence of is millions of years please provide some
3548686 this lack of agreement between field observation and uniformitarian expectation has led to conflict among specialists in the ranks of the larger earth science community
3548687 the chalk layer was not my quote but comes from
3548688 he provided not even a pic of a transitional fossil or a link where one can be viewed

3548693 well thats because theres missing part of the evelutionary chain
3548694 bj i dont know what your religious beliefs are claimed to be but there is no theistic evolution old earth
3548695 i point this out for a couple reasons but the main is that there is a marxist nwo political agenda pushing evolution in the schools and controlled media
3548696 if you had followed the links you would know that fossils form rapidly and the textbooks are simply in error at best or deceiving most likely when flood sediments cover an object they fossilize rapidly and can be observed doing so repeatedly ap article
3548697 the recent scientific discovery of how to petrify wood in a few days has again raised the question of just how long the process takes in nature

3548706 this is a big fight for me strohls 27 5 with 21 knockouts hes a big puncher who has come down from heavyweight i boxed him a lot when i lived in las vegas hes slow but very strong and always in great shape i know all about him and im a better boxer im going to win impressively if not by knockout ill outbox him badly hes going to be right in front of me and hell keep coming i have to sit down on my punches i havent been getting as many knockouts because the opposition has been better than the guys i fought earlier in my career i can still put people to sleep
3548707 im extremely proud and excited that we are in the 9th year of this tournament as it has been very successful in contributing to east los angeles community we are also happy to have cerveza tecate as the title sponsor as it brings another level of national exposure and excitement to the event

3548709 i didnt feel like i lost the fight because i was fighting hard doing everything the coaches were telling me to get this far and then lose i dont even know what happened
3548710 when i just stood there at the end i thought i was up
3548711 for him to lose could be disheartening for some of our other guys
3548712 thats going to be our biggest fear i think theyre most definitely going to be psyched out we have a psychologist around and were going to make sure that she talks to this team because im sure all of them are going to be psyched out by this
3548713 then i realized im bringing him down this was really important to him and he needed to pursue that kayla would be disappointed greg would be disappointed we would make it work
3548714 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3548715 there are many foreign elements there more than local militants

3548740 i would be willing to believe in god if there were any evidence that he exists but no such evidence exists so i dont believe
3548741 every tear shed and all the toil in life its all worth it
3548742 no matter what the cost weve got to do this
3548743 lets get people out of their suvs or lets not have them drive
3548744 you know this is fascinating how do i invest in it
3548745 well most of these companies are private startups just getting going you cant invest yet
3548746 hey if its cloudy today i cant ship you power
3548747 heres your starting rate heres your maximum rate heres your starting payment heres your maximum payment
3548748 how does it work who does what and where does the process lead
3548749 oh its too risky were not going to participate in this part of the market were going to pull back and get someone else to figure it out
3548750 lets have a standard of 20 percent similar to california
3548751 we want community choice aggregation but were not going to let our customers vote on that were just going to make the decision
3548752 gee maybe customers ought to be able to vote about this
3548753 well were going to do this and by the way were going to move all the customers over to the new provider that is the municipal provider and theyre going to have to opt out and they have to opt out in one month
3548754 were going to provide cleaner power than pg amp e and were going to do it less expensively
3548755 here are things we want to do with this customer to keep him in his home its in your interest its in his interest its in our interest
3548756 i trusted my broker i didnt know what i was getting in to
3548757 our key fundamental difference is we drive our business through the eyes of the consumer we are consumer driven and we are insight driven and as part of that our objective is to create joy wonder and a sense of enrichment that drives everything we do
3548758 the path that were currently on started five years ago when our worldwide president saturo iwata and our key game developer shigeru miyamoto saw that gaming was stagnant and in fact gaming was on the decline in japan
3548759 we took a different path one we call the path of disruption of really doing things differently focusing on games and hardware that consumers could immediately pick up and play like the ds and wii
3548760 it was all brought to life through a unique game play and interface construct touch screen for the ds and a remote that was motion sensitive for the wii
3548761 it really is recognizing the world is changing with the rise of the web the rise of even more power on the part of the consumer these consumers today they dont just consume media they want to get inside it
3548762 where that intersects with gaming frankly we dont know but we do know the answer is not residing up in redmond wash nintendos u s headquarters its getting into the key media centers to understand whats happening in the media marketplace
3548763 thats why we came to the bay area with about 65 employees and thats why we went to new york with about 35 employees
3548764 i wish we had that game this might be a very interesting game on the wii
3548765 i remember wanting to be an actor till a certain age after which i started getting drawn to filmmaking i was enjoying the process so much that i put away some of my other interests like acting and music
3548766 i play the guitar thats one of the reasons i could relate to rock on instantly
3548767 watch the film rock on is every persons story just like dil chahta hai it says youre never too old to pick up the threads and go after your dream for me there was an immediate connect and i instantly decided to do the film
3548768 i went to farhan with the script and he loved it i was sure i wanted my actors to sing their own songs in the film when i told him he had to sing as well he was more than ready to go for it
3548769 farhan also plays the guitar in rock on i had some reference songs in mind i wanted my songs to be on those lines one day farhan called me to the studios he was ready to sing so he did and i was sure that this is what i wanted
3548770 we have seen c a 2007 08 11 bu72rbp6u dtl
3548771 another factor that fueled that speculation in housing was an abundance of money flooding into the housing market from wall street i call it irrational money
3548772 today there is starting to become a shortage of capital available for housing
3548773 severe competitive pressures led to a loosening of underwriting standards for the mortgage lending industry
3548774 when you bring it out make sure it is the best one around

3548893 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3548894 from what i understand a lot of the public believes there is a conflict of interest with you handling this case and prosecuting this case why do you insist on prosecuting it and do you agree or disagree with there being a conflict of interest
3548895 well first of all i dont insist on prosecuting it because really its my decision as to whether theres a conflict or not if i see one
3548896 that is why foreign employers and organisations do not regard malaysian graduates as their top choice this is a very disheartening fact students should take full advantage of programmes in their universities to sharpen thinking skills and take opportunities to enhance leadership skills they should also sharpen their english language skills as future leaders students should strive to be multi talented and multi skilled such abilities will ensure that they succeed in whichever field they dabble in
3548897 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3548898 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia
3548899 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
3548900 we started today to demo the floor were ripping it all out and starting over we hope thats finished by the end of this week early next week and then the bids today for installing a new floor were taking bids and those are due today
3548901 if you were to install a gfci receptacle at the first outlet downstream from the distribution panel this will protect all receptacles downstream
3548902 you failed to outline the procedure that needs to be followed for downstream receptacles to be protected
3548903 i gotta lay off the way yall hate me like im adolf but yall cant see me ray charles
3548904 we australia do stand to render any assistance if that will help in terms of ceasefire and also in terms of humanitarian assistance because we do have regrettably very many displaced people
3548905 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front
3548906 there are indications that georgia asked a range of nation states including australia to consider military assistance
3548907 the government will have to explain to the australian public why increasing health insurance premiums is effective health policy
3548908 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3548909 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3548910 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3548911 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3548912 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3548913 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3548914 the difference between interest and commitment is this when youre interested in something you do it only when circumstances permit when youre committed to something you accept no excuses just results
3548915 este un capitol nchis definitiv pentru mine v rog s m n elege i i s mi respecta i decizia mi pare r u dar nu voi mai vorbi despre fotbal nu mai vreau s tiu nimic
3548916 this has been going for years and years and years in various shapes and forms
3548917 the council spent 13 000 on a consultants report that basically said the jetty should be pulled down as its a safety hazard
3548918 if the jetty was in bega it would probably already be going ahead
3548919 merimbula does seem to get a bad deal and what it demonstrates again is the begacentric nature of this council
3548920 council has got 200 000 of federal money and 100 000 of the state governments money just sitting there lets use it
3548921 the application reflects a council decision to support an upgrade championed by the former merimbula lakes and foreshore committee and is based on a community proposal estimated by that group to cost 450 000
3548922 its true that there has been a lot of discussion over the jetty replacement but council cant spend money until we have development consent
3548923 the council is very aware of the significant role the jetty plays it is part of merimbulas public recreation facilities and the foreshore experience is merimbulas strength
3548924 nothing happens as quickly as we like and we all get frustrated by the process but working together and with each other is the best way to achieve our goals
3548925 we anticipate some resolution in the near future and the merimbula ratepayers action group are our partners in this and we will let them know whats going on
3548926 im not calling on a dollar for dollar increase in funding but the state government to contribute more in its own right
3548927 the jetty is an infrastructure that benefits the state government as much as anyone else
3548928 it is a stigma they have had to work hard to shake off but in reality they are a strong group of women who are working hard for the good of the community
3548929 el problema de las personas con discapacidad no es del gobierno sino de los parlamentarios de la oposici n que no quieren dar curso al proyecto de ley enviado por el ejecutivo
3548930 el tema no est en mi despacho ni del ministro de gobierno est en manos de los parlamentarios de la oposici n
3548931 es injusto se alar que el poder ejecutivo no hace nada
3548932 lo que tenemos entendido es que se han vuelto a abrir las posibilidades de negociaci n en principio aceptaron luego fueron a plantear el tema de arbitraje y ahora la puerta est abierta y nosotros saludamos que el proceso se haya dado de esa manera
3548933 basically i believe that council has lost its democratic way and i want to make sure that does not happen again
3548934 if you dont meet the deadline then unfortunately you cant run the race were expecting a strong field and hopefully not too many late scratchings

3548936 i felt absolutely privileged to receive the award it was a wonderful experience
3548937 i didnt know the ceremony would be just for me you assume that if something is organised at government house then all the people receiving the award would be there her excellency is a pretty busy lady
3548938 it was an honour to meet and talk with mrs bashir she was really nice and very down to earth

3548945 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment
3548946 i think its an obscenity i cannot imagine that people in that situation who did what they did to their own daughter are attempting to profit from it
3548947 they are reasonably easy to spot especially in places where the water surface is fairly flat and calm so the ripples created when the animals swim and dive are easy to see
3548948 we are hoping to find people in the bombala region who will take a few minutes to watch for platypus in their local creek or river and record their sightings
3548949 by keeping track of how many animals are seen in different places we can build up quite an accurate picture of how the population as a whole is distributed
3548950 mental illness affects one in every five australians and 62 of people with mental illness depend on support from carers and families
3548951 we already have community midwife fran peterie coming to bombala at least once a fortnight to work with our ladies but this is something extra that aims to get mums in earlier to learn about their pregnancies from the 12 week stage onwards
3548952 we will be working closely with the local doctors to let mothers know that the program is running and the hospital will be making our bookings
3548953 through the program the mothers will be able to meet with fran to learn more about early pregnancy as well as touching base with child and family health nurse kirsty brownlie who they will be meeting with after the baby is born
3548954 its a big cooperative approach to keep prospective local mothers better informed and supported
3548955 and of course the ladies can ask me any questions they might have about the first 20 weeks of pregnancy
3548956 its all about supporting a our ladies in the area and keeping pregnancy education locally accessible
3548957 native fauna are protected in nsw under section 45 1 a of the national parks and wildlife act 1974
3548958 however if native animals are causing damage or economic hardship on private property then npws may be able to issue a licence allowing the owner or occupier to cull the native animals responsible
3548959 if a licence is issued it will indicate the species and number of fauna allowed to be culled as well as the property name and owner and duration of the licence
3548960 licences are free and help npws to monitor wildlife issues in the local area

3549004 if we had met under these same circumstances five years ago we would be busy in bed right now
3549005 i would use you and would let you use me that was me back then
3549006 fujimoto and i we were together a long time ago
3549007 what happened to you with them with him no matter how bad it is its already a part of your memory i dont think anything i do could make you forget you understand
3549008 i dont want to wake up one morning thinking that all i am to you is a remedy to your pain
3549009 ill just eat half so you can eat a heavy breakfast its gonna be a long day for us
3549010 well youll be needing a whole lot of energy theres the drive to the office theres ayaka and mai theres the board meeting with the international board theres ayaka and mai theres the meeting with matsuuras people theres ayaka and mai then theres the meeting with ken and seito and theres ayaka and mai finally you have to go to the hospital after all those meetings to look after jr so you need to eat more
3549011 ah ka chan i forgot to tell you yesterday some of these are live plants uh ayumin said you were into gardening before
3549012 oh before we had a garden my sisters and i we had one with ka san back home
3549013 yeah thats what ayumin said well i figured you might want some plants in the house

3549015 dont say that you know thats not true i love you and everything i give you i give out of love you deserve my love because i chose you
3549016 i am happy im happy because im me and youre you and im with you and i love you
3549017 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3549018 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3549019 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3549020 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3549021 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3549022 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3549023 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3549024 we wanted to cheer her up and there arent many things you can give to someone who is ill
3549025 i thought it was taking away something very important from someone who wasnt very well if i was on a ward id like to receive cards
3549026 we had never heard of this before and can only assume it is due to any bugs in the flowers or vases being knocked over
3549027 we asked if they could be left in a dayroom or nurses quarters but this was also rejected and they wouldnt dispose of them so the alternative was to bin them or bring them home
3549028 frenchay is a wonderful hospital but it seems a shame people cant receive cards or flowers they could maybe put the cards and flowers in an area away from the beds
3549029 many older people find get well cards to be a reassuring and pleasant distraction from illness while in hospital
3549030 while we fully understand the paramount importance of keeping hospital wards clean and tidy we cant help wondering whether this isnt a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut we would hope that with a bit of flexible thinking it would be possible to allow older people to recover with appropriate support from family and friends
3549031 we dont prevent patients displaying get well cards on the wards
3549032 however maintaining a clean environment and reducing infection is this trusts number one priority
3549033 it is particularly important that the area around the patients bed is kept as clean as possible and is free of clutter so our cleaners can get complete access
3549034 responsibility for cleanliness lies with the sister in charge on each ward and if they feel cards on display by a patients bedside are getting in the way of domestic staff they will ask them to be taken down
3549035 we hope this particular patient and their family understand the very good reasons why they were asked to do this
3549036 as the cost of living is on the up these figures even if they are only part reflective of pensioners as a whole are of real concern
3549037 retirement should be a time to enjoy yourself after all those years of hard work
3549038 the cost of living for the elderly has surpassed inflation over the past decade therefore it is more important than ever that consumers are aware of the dangers of approaching retirement with such large amounts of debt
3549039 for many pensioners today these figures show its a case of bought then worrying about it now
3549040 with the costs of living increasing dramatically particularly as winter approaches and fuel costs mount up it is vital that those struggling are given the help they need to ensure that people arent trapped by debt
3549041 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3549042 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3549043 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3549044 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3549045 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3549046 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3549047 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3549048 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3549049 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3549050 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rainforests their peoples and their species
3549051 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3549052 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3549053 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3549054 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
3549055 our results indicate that needle free nasal immunization using a combination of nanoemulsion and hepatitis b antigen could be a safe and effective hepatitis b vaccine and also provide an alternative booster method for existing vaccines
3549056 our studies however indicate no inflammation and no evidence of the vaccine in the olfactory bulb
3549057 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of species distributions
3549058 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
3549059 when modeling species distributions it is important to consider a large amount of climatic data and evaluate the methods used especially when dealing with important issues such as invasive species whose ecological limitations may not be immediately obvious
3549060 snakes already get an unwarranted bad reputation and the last thing needed in our current biodiversity crisis is to drum up more hatred of these animals by suggesting an impending full scale north american invasion by pythons when properly constructed climate models suggest the opposite
3549061 the man who can drive himself further once the effort gets painful is the man who will win
3549062 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3549063 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3549064 attended a memorial service for hollywood powerhouse bernie brillstein who passed away on august 7th at the age of 77
3549065 it was a good consultation there was good representation from young people including from young women there were a lot of discussions on the community issues that young people want to focus on and develop
3549066 it gives a ray of light in the minds of the young people that there might be some help there has been support from leaders as well the north malaita council of chiefs was represented at the consultations and north malaita provincial governments youth minister sees this as a model to start working from
3549067 were appealing to potential partners in the to give support to the training and udrf
3549068 this is the first of its kind its an indigenous grassroots initiative that comes from young people themselves rural areas have been disconnected so its time to invest in these areas if youre looking to the future
3549069 books about miserable northern working class kids with mad pentecostal parents growing up without any books
3549070 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3549071 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3549072 the prospects do not look good for higher education if theyre elected
3549073 its back to school time and people are thinking about school and we want to get people thinking about who theyre electing
3549074 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war the speakers failed to hold george bush and dick cheney accountable
3549075 jeff merkleys record in the oregon state house shows he can work across the partisan divide to get results that improve the lives of oregonians
3549076 with the serious challenges we face from ending the war in iraq to providing health care to all americans to solving the climate crisis jeff merkley is the only choice for the senate
3549077 smith is the last republican standing in a state where democrats now occupy every other statewide office majorities in the state legislature and four out of five congressional seats oregon after all hasnt voted for a republican presidential candidate since ronald reagan and has had a democratic governor since 1986 all that said there is a reason why smith is still standing today and the democratic primary in this race allowed smith to capture the center

3549085 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3549086 through his work in the and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3549087 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3549088 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future

3549095 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect

3549548 yesterdays story in the wall street journal fails to make the distinction between corporate credit unions which serve other credit unions and natural person credit unions which serve individuals in addition in several instances the term big is arbitrarily substituted for corporate in the article
3549549 it is important for the public to understand that corporate credit unions investments are limited to the most highly rated securities also natural person credit unions otherwise referred to as regular credit unions in the article are demonstrating solid fundamentals especially by contrast with other federally insured institutions like banks
3549550 as stated in yesterdays article credit unions are among the most conservatively run financial institutions in the u s and because of their traditional practices credit unions are managing well in this economic climate the recent development for corporate credit unions as also noted in the feature is just another indication that almost no financial sector is immune from the current economy

3549562 the prolonged softness in the overall economy particularly in the construction and housing segments caused many commercial truck owners to defer purchase or lease of new vehicles
3549563 while there has been a near collapse in the pickup truck market and continued softness in the overall commercial truck market

3549577 welcome to chez nous miss lucille towe or should i say
3549578 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3549579 the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are you know almost hateful and we want this to be the beginning of the end we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes
3549580 thats the great thing you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they want to do
3549581 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3549582 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3549583 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3549584 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3549585 would not be in the best interest of the community

3549593 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3549594 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3549595 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3549596 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3549597 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3549598 old times vitaly churkin told cnn his country is seeking details on what started the fighting
3549599 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3549600 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3549601 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3549602 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3549603 could europe be involved in a peacekeeping mission europe is available to do that of course

3549622 there are services and programs available that many people dont know about or are unaware of
3549623 we point people to resources and i can help people do research but i cannot provide legal advice
3549624 the public library does contain circulating copies of many of these materials
3549625 so i cant work out anymore i have to give everything up now
3549626 no but think about this i have given everything up i have nothing else except playing wife and mommy
3549627 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3549628 he said he did it for the adrenaline rush for the challenge
3549629 were trying to support parents in turning off the distractions and connecting with children
3549630 the research shows that children who eat five or more meals with their families are less likely to be involved in risky behaviors
3549631 who would have thought that doing something as simple as eating meals together as a family could have such a profound effect on families
3549632 the main purpose is to sit down with your family have a meal and connect
3549633 its a challenge to find a time when everybody can sit down and eat regardless of whether its a takeout meal or home cooked
3549634 so the challenge is to sit down together and eat a meal and talk to each other without the distractions of tv or cell phones or texting
3549635 i dont think people want government buildings to be grand
3549636 they are paying for it and all those amenities add costs
3549637 come on folks were suburban bedroom communities with a smattering of offices and shopping plazas
3549638 lets give up spending tax money to aggrandize our communities to say were better than you are we have a more elegant city hall
3549639 weve got an upscale neighborhood all around it and hopefully an upscale retail area
3549640 youre putting up show buildings like that and youre telling me spending needs to be cut on the county level
3549641 the architect came back with a grand building full of stone and glass all around and all of us looked at that and said this is a jail we dont want an ugly building in the middle of a residential area but it doesnt need to look like a grand palace we took out fancy stone and a glass roof that couldnt be modified if needed to add a pod on top thats the approach i take to government buildings
3549642 it is very nice now but there were things taken out of it
3549643 all those skylights were an expense but standing in there it adds a lot to the facility
3549644 but i think people are finally seeing that having nice buildings does build civic pride and when professionals decide where to live they will drive around and see whether a city invests in its infrastructure places that do spend a little bit more portray that better
3549645 normalmente atendemos pouco mais de 200 pessoas por dia hoje com certeza at as 21 horas vamos passar e muito dos 300 atendimentos

3549648 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
3549649 white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush tahir jalil habbush the director of the mukhabarat to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
3549650 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
3549651 in april 2001 the severity of it hit everyone around the country
3549652 since april 2001 its like being buried in mud you have rises and falls for a month or two there is hiring like the flame is lit then suddenly it drops back this all weighs heavily on the minds of those in the labor force
3549653 differentiating factors between likely candidates for a job are important
3549654 does the person have a two year or four year degree or a masters degree is the potential candidate located within reasonable proximity or will he she have to relocate and at whose expense in addition what are the costs of bringing someone in for an interview
3549655 lets face it relocation adds cost to a companys recruiting efforts
3549656 and the financial decision makers do not want to spend extra money on relocation
3549657 then a company may cover a one hundred mile radius which is considered a commutable distance once these outlets are exhausted they may launch a search in a multi state area
3549658 because they see a good employee as a wise investment but it is not uncommon for potential employees to pay for their own relocation these days
3549659 speak to your family or those you cohabitate with first before applying to other areas and see how they feel about the move
3549660 ask some important questions of yourself for instance is it within your financial budget to consider paying to move yourself and your loved ones
3549661 dont wait until the job offer appears before weighing these considerations
3549662 hayden has been set back for probably three to four weeks so we just have to sort of monitor that
3549663 jamie was operated on his hip about five weeks ago we knew he would probably miss the first couple of games of the season
3549664 it is good that it has been sorted out he will be back hopefully sooner rather than later
3549665 we have got amaral in there and i think pellegrino has come in and surprised a lot of people
3549666 he is an elegant player as well so i think in that scope i think we have replaced well
3549667 they have lost two very good players but i think they have recruited quite well as well
3549668 customers having chosen offshore replication and redundancy solutions with us were not disappointed in the results during and after hurricane ivan global redundancy is the only proven method to ensure resilient service in the event of catastrophic disasters
3549669 although our efforts have been focused on our key customers our families and getting supplies to from the island in order to assist the cayman islands government make no mistake that ifs is in business and ready to provide our services to the cayman islands business community
3549670 a lot of people are saying usain and tyson are very strong finishers but if i get out in front of them no matter how they are finishing they wont even close on me
3549671 i did some great things in practice for the past couple of weeks
3549672 this is the first time ive seen my coach so excited so all i have to do is go there and just be like i was in the last two races and i do it
3549673 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since i have been here they have tested me four times and took blood a lot of blood
3549674 they are taking so much blood we are going to be very weak before the finals of the 100 metres
3549675 and i am almost sure i might be tested tomorrow
3549676 i dont know about anybody else but they are really down on my case and my team mate michael frater and usain
3549677 with me and usain out there its a big thing in jamaica
3549678 they expect us to be first and second a world record and stuff like that
3549679 daddy just sits in the den and wont play with me anymore
3549680 devote their efforts to building the groundwork for durable peace
3549681 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3549682 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
3549683 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
3549684 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
3549685 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
3549686 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience
3549687 assured them of pakistans full moral and diplomatic support to the kashmir cause
3549688 regretted the excessive use of force by the indian security forces against the kashmiri people and called for an immediate end to violence in jammu and kashmir
3549689 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3549690 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3549691 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3549692 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3549693 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3549694 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3549695 uncertainty and volatility in global credit markets will continue to place upward pressure on funding costs
3549696 we are cautious going into the new financial year and the group will continue with its conservative stance until signs of improvements in economic conditions are evident
3549697 the groups capital position is strong with capital levels well above target ranges
3549698 while these broad trends are clearly evident the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict
3549699 there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy but it is important that we recognise there are potentially a number of positive influences
3549700 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic growth with credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade
3549701 while it is clearly a time to be cautious the current environment presents well managed banks like the commonwealth bank of australia with opportunities to grow even stronger
3549702 since leaving spamalot in may jokes have just not been funny food has lost its taste the grass is no longer green the sky no longer blue and babies wont stop crying im so excited about coming back to the funniest show in the world
3549703 we are sure the four had thrown adhikary off the top floor we have got several witnesses to corroborate the charges
3549704 some of the women participants who had come to us with the complaint later told us they had been forced to do so by the shows producers they said they had been promised an advantage over other participants if they lodged a complaint
3549705 he never touched alcohol had he been guilty he would have taken a safer way to flee why would he jump to his death
3549706 why did the doctors here refer him to kolkata when he wasnt sick at all he was simply trying to use his clout in kolkata to get himself out of the lock up its been four days since the incident and yet police have not been able to arrest the fourth accused
3549707 its degrading to have someone who just hired you to stick his hands down your pants
3549708 why didnt you turn around and knock him out right there
3549709 i knew what i was there for to pay my part of the bargain
3549710 you have to tell the police the truth its the right thing to do
3549711 go off and make your own mistakes and well be there to support you if it goes wrong
3549712 this isnt the time to say i told you so
3549713 weve worked well and its a nice feeling where we are at the moment but theres no euphoria or feeling of told you so there is a much bigger prize
3549714 if we can beat canberra then the play offs are achievable
3549715 i have never felt anything other than what i thought was needed in terms of retaining or attaining the players we have
3549716 im not going to comment on whether brian smith has been vindicated for the changes he made last season
3549717 last year was last year and i will always want the knights to be successful but theres a right and wrong way of doing things and i think the way things were done last year was not right you cant help but put a lot of their success down to the form of kurt gidley and danny buderus
3549718 the decision to re sign kurt gidley early in the season has been the signing of the season
3549719 since chief executive steve burraston locked him up after round one or two he has improved out of sight
3549720 couples today want to have better relationships and better sex and if taking a class helps theyll do it

3549722 the more you indulge in your senses and become familiar with them the more pleasure youll be able to receive
3549723 the object of this class is to drive a man insane

3549759 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3549760 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3549761 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3549762 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3549763 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3549764 old times vitaly churkin told cnn his country is seeking details on what started the fighting
3549765 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3549766 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3549767 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3549768 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days

3549772 careful hes not that powerful so he could break beast
3549773 do you know how they had first come to be called beauty and the beast
3549774 well naturally when her family found out about him they tried keeping her away he was a beast and her an eloquent fairy of noble blood their families were horrified to find them in love finding afterwards that they were both soul mates and bound to each other they just couldnt handle it and so they were disowned by their families and caste out
3549775 many people in this organization have been wounded one way or another one girl was taken from her homeland and studied by scientists they tried to discern her powers and find the key that was said to be within her kind she hated them for testing on her and after an accident they released her they had unlocked a few of her dormant powers and had enhanced all of her senses after shed been released a few more little accidents happened and she became too big of a threat to ignore and too big of a necessity to destroy in the end the scientists captured her once more and found that the key that they had been searching for was inside of her very essence an ally of hers tried to rescue her but he was too late the scientists had her and using her powers against her the made her their servant so as to keep her close
3549776 they couldnt just leave it at that though her memories needed to be taken away from her and her ally so they wouldnt know the truth which they had discovered so the mans memories were transferred into one of the scientists and the girls memories were accidentally put into the man by the time the exchange was made she couldnt remember a thing and the man couldnt make any sense of anything because her memories were swirling in his head the scientists had made one mistake too many though and by taking her memories from her the girl had made a defensive barrier around her soul of silver mist the scientists didnt have anything powerful enough to tear through the mist and they couldnt give her memories back to her because she would just attack them again now all the scientists are dead except for one
3549777 who is this girl father is she in the in the sno
3549778 natara that girl was named raven her father was a strong demon and the man she loved was an angelic hybrid her mother died soon after she was born but her mother was a guardian angel which is an angel that is born on earth and helps big events happen raven was the demon from the prophecy and the one the ancients had given the last piece of the school to her father had placed it in his daughters soul where he had believed no one would find it
3549779 father arent i healed i dont want to be a burden
3549780 and he said that your name was natara and that you were lucky to be alive right
3549781 sadly no i wasnt but i did still influence that day for example i was the one who named you
3549782 damn waste of a good phone too bad you forgot it was on you when you shifted into one of them horses to go watch the hunt damn shame
3549783 damn and i thought i had it bad killing people at the age of ten
3549784 um yeah an organization will come into power lead by a puppet master and a human and a demon will take it down
3549785 im sorry davien but i cant let this go on any longer i dont want someone draining me dry just to make a stupid power juice or whatever

3549787 i think she might have come through here the tunnel looks cleaner than it would have if no one had disturbed it i dont see any foot prints though probably because shes light footed

3549789 well we determind that it was not used for any narcotics but its still not alowed in student housing
3549790 what was the context in which it was taken did an ra walk in and take it or did they call security
3549791 but the whately pioneers at this point im going to say are officially a pretty good team
3549792 once you put on the uniform its like you assume the persona you step back in time and you become these players
3549793 people are playing just as hard but you dont see the arguments
3549794 vintage is pretty much a different sport to me you have to play fundamentals ive been playing baseball for 25 years so i try my best
3549795 when i first heard about vintage baseball i thought it was kind of silly
3549796 i didnt realize that you had to be twice as good a player to do it
3549797 we dont wear helmets and the rules are tough to remember theyre so different
3549798 we went through the woods to get to the field and the whole thing was all grass it was all painted up
3549799 it was like stepping into another world i was pretty much hooked since then it was a great experience
3549800 people stop their cars along the road when were playing
3549801 thirty to 40 people watch our vintage games usually it really is an entertaining game to watch
3549802 for those people who dont get it its just being more obvious about how timeless baseball is we turn the clock back 100 years and you see its the same game and thats unique to baseball i cant imagine not playing
3549803 the people who enjoy vintage and stay with it have a respect for the game
3549804 ive used wood bats all my life we didnt even have full batting helmets when i played little league
3549805 they say you have two deaths your baseball death when you cant play anymore and your real death and my baseball death is coming sooner rather than later
3549806 our polling tells us that americans are still not tuned into what the candidates might do to fix the economy they dont know the facts
3549807 unions card check trade education reform oh my unions how evil education reform gasp
3549808 why are all the best events monthly instead of weekly
3549809 why are all of our nights at dive bars and not proper clubs
3549810 why is there a cover charge more than five dollars
3549811 why did the event get cancelled that first night was so good
3549812 the basic reason for china closing the gap is that growth in the u s economy has essentially been zero over the last year and will continue to struggle over the next year
3549813 the basic reason is that growth in the u s economy has essentially been zero over the last year and will continue to struggle over the next year
3549814 we know that china is a big manufacturing giant now
3549815 what this study suggests is that it will continue to play an increasingly larger role
3549816 the expanding market in china is more likely to open up greater opportunities for the u s as well as other producers
3549817 in many ways it has to do with the weakening u s economy
3549818 it also shows how china is a key player in the global economy and that china is not invulnerable to global trends
3549819 china needs exports markets as the global economy slows china needs to make sure that consumers are going to buy its goods
3549820 these cost pressures might mean it will take longer to outstrip the u s in manufacturing
3549821 fourteen people died in the agitation of 1953 and the slogan was one constitution one flag and one head
3549822 it also said that if all points are met with jammu will still feel discontent since their is a political disparity
3549823 there are elements within the us administration who would be very nervous about musharraf leaving the scene as they think the civilians are not in control of the army and the isi
3549824 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
3549825 i shall live with perserverance in the spirit of taekwondo having honor with others integrity within myself and self control in my actions

3549843 we usually have about 20 dog meat dishes on our menu it will certainly have an effect on our sales

3549848 this is actually really interesting this month by my count we have 11 advisories covering 26 vulnerabilities
3549849 there were originally supposed to be 12 advisories but it appears as though the windows media player update was pulled since this was originally marked critical its not good that its pulled
3549850 its like a being given a treasure map thats half completed theres still a lot of space to cover but its significantly smaller than if you had no insight at all
3549851 also four of the 12 advisories had vulnerabilities that had already been publicly disclosed and one half of those publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are already being actively exploited
3549852 looks like summer vacation is over a little early for network security professionals after a light july the august patch tuesday will be a very busy one
3549853 the critical updates will affect both desktops and servers so it departments will need to quickly and carefully assess which patches should receive priority
3549854 the five critical patches need to get installed as soon as possible this month
3549855 all of these patches can affect client by attack vectors that are used in day to day client side computer use visiting an evil web site or by opening an evil document
3549856 continuing the ongoing trend attackers are increasingly targeting common users and tricking them into accessing a malicious web site or opening an unsolicited document
3549857 todays bulletins mostly deal with user driven applications such microsoft office including word excel powerpoint access and others such as internet explorer outlook express and windows messenger this is something people need to be aware of and prioritize more sooner than later
3549858 youre here for the same reason i am youre going to put that quarter of a million dollars before you put me youve known me three weeks that quarter of a million dollars will last you longer than that
3549859 while fiercely competing in the marketplace does create some degree of tension or even mistrust between two companies that activity also creates a lot of common ground for discussion about the market and the future

3549877 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3549878 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3549879 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3549880 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3549881 we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3549882 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3549883 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3549884 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3549885 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
3549886 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3549887 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3549888 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3549889 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3549890 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise
3549891 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world
3549892 we recommend you do this to avoid pci compliance liability with your website you dont have to do this but we do want you to sign a form to say we recommended this and you declined

3549897 how long has it been since you last used a bus
3549898 this policy doesnt apply for items that are sold as is
3549899 not knowing that it was going to take that long was the big issue that i have its very unprofessional and had i known i could have rearranged my day or made plans to come back a different time
3549900 weve been short staff in summer you have people who take vacations and then weve had to deal with some illnesses with some of our employees so it has without a doubt extended the time that customers are having to wait
3549901 i think its ridiculous there could damn sure be something done to speed this process up
3549902 the most common description of chupacabra is a reptile like being appearing to have leathery or scaly greenish gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back this form stands approximately 3 to 4 feet 1 to 1 2 m high and stands and hops in a similar fashion to a kangaroo in at least one sighting the creature hopped 20 feet this variety is said to have a dog or panther like nose and face a forked tongue and large fangs it is said to hiss and screech when alarmed as well as leave a sulfuric stench behind

3549908 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3549909 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3549910 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3549911 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3549912 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3549913 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3549914 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3549915 visual studio 2008 service pack 1 sp1 today i am unable to build my website anymore
3549916 you grew up here so its not spectacular to you its just normal
3549917 yeah and have you ever noticed where its beautiful theres a lot of pretty but not a lot of jobs unless you worked for the university
3549918 should not be surprised at the nationalism of kashmiris there has been a facade of normalcy in kashmir tourists coming and mobile phones arriving do not mean that people are not angry
3549919 wasted chances to come up with a creative solution with pakistan and kashmiris
3549920 i think the blockade made people realise that kashmir at the moment totally depends on india and that we need to be economically independent
3549921 the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
3549922 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3549923 the first thing is the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process
3549924 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3549925 the university of oxford has no record of mr ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
3549926 professor edmund rolls professor peter bryant and professor alan cowey have all at some stage held posts at the university of oxford however none of them work in the field of law and none of them would sign degree certificates

3549929 they take time to teach the kids theres itty bitty ones on the ice with them its a family oriented sort of place you feel like you belong to something special
3549930 theres no shortage of activities for youth these days with sports academics and entertainment options
3549931 our industry has become complacent in marketing what we have to the general public everybody thinks every family in minnesota has a pair of skates in the closet but thats not the case anymore
3549932 the funnest part for me is learning new things like how to go around in a circle
3549933 they are all very caring of the other skaters it is a nice community feeling
3549934 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3549935 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3549936 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3549937 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3549938 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
3549939 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3549940 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3549941 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3549942 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3549943 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3549944 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3549945 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london
3549946 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
3549947 this report from david camerons favourite thinktank has just dismissed a huge area of the country as worthless is it any wonder there are no tory councillors in liverpool when for all their warm words they have not changed a bit
3549948 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3549949 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3549950 we really wanted this functionality for yahoo services but we thought that if we just do it ourselves it is much less likely to get wide adoption
