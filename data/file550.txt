5500004 el derecho de asilo en el mundo no es para terroristas

5500006 rasheed is my favorite piston and i also wanted as the middle name somebody off the bench so i chose amir johnson
5500007 sometimes when you have a great shooting team you fall in love with just staying outside
5500008 but rodney not only can he shoot the ball he can get in the paint thats where we need to change things a little bit get into the paint more and score more in the paint thats what coach is preaching and thats what were going to do more this year get into the paint and get to the foul line
5500009 i love him he ran the floor every time in las vegas i wish he would have rebounded the ball a little better out there numbers wise but he did everything we asked him to do coach asked him to sprint the floor and run to the rim every time he did we asked him to trap on the side pick and rolls he did we asked him to show up on high pick and rolls he did all the thing we asked him to do i thought he had a great two weeks in vegas im looking forward to working more with him hes one of those athletic kids who is going to be able to roll to the rim and finish especially with a guy like rasheed spacing the floor what are you going to do are you going to stop the roll or are you going to stop the three that creates problems
5500010 in science this year we will be studying ecology and examining the ecological footprint we leave on our planet we encourage you to work as a family in these exercises our goal is to raise consciousness of the impact we make on earth as well as its resources each six weeks a list will come home with your student listing many different things you can do as a family to help the environment your student will be asked to choose at least one item and to journal observations before during and after the change your commitment to this project will assist in underlining the importance of taking care of our planet to ensure the earth will remain healthy for many generations

5500017 youre listening to me right you know better than i do how dangerous some of the girls in here are theyll eat you alive given half the chance some of them literally

5500020 oh dear have a bit of an accident did we

5500025 shame you two seem closer every time i see you i could put in a request to switch cells if you like

5500027 if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all
5500028 health wise if he were eating like this long term hed probably be having to see a cardiologist regularly
5500029 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5500030 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5500031 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5500032 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5500033 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5500034 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5500035 you have to compete and you have to compete fiercely but from what ive been able to determine this friendship and this mutual respect is very genuine
5500036 i mean i knew going into floor that nastia had a huge lead and i was so proud i mean i pretty much knew she had the gold and honestly by then i didnt care like the score or anything i just i wanted to go out and hit the routine of my life and just finish off this olympic experience as best as i could and i have no regrets and i take nothing back i had a great time and i am so honored to be wearing the silver medal
5500037 i wanted to go out and hit the routine of my life
5500038 in the 1990s the ten became more and more difficult to achieve because as difficulty increased few gymnasts actually started from a ten and those gymnast who were performing the most difficult routines would have trouble performing them perfectly in the new system there are two separate scores one for difficulty and one for execution two separate panels of judges evaluate the difficulty and execution of the routine and the two scores are added together the goal of this system is to focus more on the artistry and value of the performance as a whole
5500039 the artistry and value of the performance as a whole
5500040 tom is timely thought provoking and all about the new brand vision packaged as a seinfeld stand up i went to school on his ideas
5500041 its hard to find a candidate who supports all of the churchs teaching
5500042 one of the staff members of the diocese said that catholics should vote their conscience
5500043 were not interested in creating the united catholic states of america were not into endorsing party candidates or parties we want to focus on issues
5500044 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5500045 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5500046 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5500047 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5500048 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5500049 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5500050 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5500051 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5500052 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5500053 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5500054 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5500055 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5500056 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5500057 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5500058 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5500059 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5500060 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5500061 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5500062 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5500063 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5500064 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5500065 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5500066 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5500067 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5500068 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5500069 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5500070 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5500071 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5500072 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5500073 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5500074 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5500075 en la siguiente estaci n todo el mundo est creciendo usted podr ver a obteniendo su licencia de conducir todas esas cosas buenas y tambi n podr a ayudar a que los padres vean c mo crecen sus ni os as en la siguiente estaci n todo el mundo es impresionante todo el mundo es asombroso y vi ndolos crecer es simplemente genial

5500077 we are being told the anti missile defense system is targeted against something that does not exist doesnt it seem funny to you to say the least
5500078 two weeks later they still have not been found the question is where is saddam hussein where are those weapons of mass destruction if they were ever in existence is saddam hussein in a bunker sitting on cases containing weapons of mass destruction preparing to blow the whole place up

5500080 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5500081 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5500082 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5500083 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5500084 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5500085 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5500086 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5500087 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5500088 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5500089 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5500090 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5500091 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5500092 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5500093 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5500094 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5500095 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5500096 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5500097 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5500098 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5500099 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5500100 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5500101 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5500102 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5500103 u think u some other kind of nigga better than the rest of us

5500113 voters in the third district deserve straight answers to the problems that face them today and top among them is americas energy independence while minnesotans are looking for solutions to out of control energy prices paulsen is offering nothing but empty rhetoric that simply doesnt match his record
5500114 we need a comprehensive strategy to promote the use of alternative energy sources decrease our dependence on foreign oil protect the environment encourage conservation reduce demand and pursue public private partnerships to develop alternative fuels
5500115 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5500116 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
5500117 if the convention wasnt in i wouldnt be at the convention
5500118 its funny how things change when norm coleman first ran for the senate in 2002 he touted his close relationship with president bush and vice president cheney and said that it would benefit
5500119 now six years later coleman is running away from his record of loyal support for president bush so much so that he wouldnt even attend the upcoming republican convention if it werent in
5500120 senator coleman must think minnesotans havent noticed that he has made his political career off the republican label and willingly hitched his star to george w bush but minnesotans have noticed they know that colemans record as a bush loyalist fierce republican partisan and fervent protector of special interests like big oil is undeniable and minnesotans know that colemans warm embrace of george bush and record of firm support for utterly failed republican policies are to blame for the mess that we find ourselves in today
5500121 coleman said convention attendance is a simple election year decision for many senators who are facing tough re election battles
5500122 coleman and jeff larson are also widely credited with persuading senior republican leaders to select minneapolis st paul as the host for the gops national convention in september
5500123 is it a plus to stand with the president in my state am i going to get you know votes for that probably not but in the end good policy i hope and believe becomes good politics in other words ultimately folks get that yeah this is the right thing
5500124 the republican national convention is scheduled for sept 1 4 in minneapolis st paul but the onslaught of party faithful is likely to be more of a liability for coleman than anything else coleman frankly at this point is in a pretty strong position so i think the strategy for coleman is not to let the republican convention hurt him university of minnesota professor larry jacobs said coleman is positioning himself as a pragmatic independent
5500125 vice president dick cheney a conservative favorite but a divisive national figure will join president bush in addressing delegates on the opening night of the republican national convention the white house said friday
5500126 you dont ignore your party on the other hand part of what my whole record of public service has been about is bringing people together to get things done and thats what i sell and i think thats what folks are looking for in these times
5500127 in 1996 norm became increasingly frustrated with a democratic party that he felt was moving away from minnesotas hardworking middle class roots and values he joined the republican party which shared his vision on holding down taxes growing jobs reforming education and increasing public safety in his 1997 campaign for re election as a republican he received 59 percent of the vote
5500128 in 2003 while cq found sen coleman to have supported the president 98 of the time it also found him to be the eighth most likely republican to break from his party on party unity votes at 92 the 2006 survey placed him in exactly the same position eighth most independent republican
5500129 is it a plus to stand with the president in my state am i going to get you know votes for that probably not but in the end good policy i hope and believe becomes good politics in other words ultimately folks get that yeah this is the right thing
5500130 wouldnt it be great to have a president we could actually be proud of
5500131 when we sing god bless it is a prayer and i believe this person is part of gods answer
5500132 im out there rallying the faithful in other states and im proud of that im thrilled to have that opportunity
5500133 senator coleman is one of the partys most effective spokesmen and advocate for the presidents message
5500134 we do however have a problem with colemans behavior in said coleman behaved as if taking orders directly from karl rove
5500135 its one thing for coleman to introduce bush at a twin cities rally or to appear at a republican convention to extol bushs virtues and bash the opposition its quite another for him to behave as though he were a republican political operative taking cues from karl rove
5500136 we cant recall a precedent for colemans called colemans actions disgusting and warranting apology
5500137 its disgusting behavior and it would be equally disgusting if sen mark dayton were to show up at the republican convention in a similar role for kerry this isnt the only way in which coleman has carried such poisonous political water for bush but it is the worst coleman owes an apology to the senate and to the constituents who elected him and expected him to serve decorously in this nations most august political body
5500138 to be very blunt and god watch over pauls soul i am a 99 percent improvement over paul wellstone just about on every issue
5500139 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation
5500140 becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
5500141 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase

5500230 in the material world which is full of darkness and dangers combined with birth and death and full of different anxieties the only way to get out of the great entanglement is to accept loving transcendental devotional service to lord vasudeva

5500240 when hindraf said we carried out genocide its allegation was a sign of evil please think about the cabinet
5500241 half of it is non malays non umno members and non muslims
5500242 you think they the cabinet would go with the government and allow themselves to be associated with it tak masuk akal this does not make sense
5500243 as it is very difficult to identify ones enemies especially in politics
5500244 people who are out to topple you in politics will resort to anything including recording or filming who you see and what you say

5500247 the countrys successes and achievements didnt come about due to street demonstrations or illegal protests
5500248 we have progressed because we have been able to maintain democratic institutions which respect the law while the people enjoyed the fruits of peace and political stability
5500249 if freedom cannot be respected and used in a responsible manner the people themselves will be at the losing end
5500250 as can be seen from todays memorandum the people who remained silent have now stood up to make their stand they want peace to be maintained
5500251 we also condemn accusations that the countrys leaders had allowed ethnic cleansing to occur in the country
5500252 hindraf has presented the wrong view to the world that the indian community here is being persecuted this group is not fighting for our rights
5500253 was there ethnic cleansing there was nothing about wiping out the indians in the country
5500254 ok enough already lets all be civilised and sit down and talk
5500255 a sra rosa era uma personagem muito interessante era uma mulher do campo igual a todas as outras com uns olhos que n o enganavam ningu m e que eram absolutamente excepcionais de finura de intelig ncia de esperteza

5500259 barcelos tem uma produ o de figurado muito em s rie
5500260 foi uma tolice que perverteu a originalidade o anonimato que era a marca do figurado da terra
5500261 o cavaleiro uma perman ncia na arte popular de todo o mundo uma figura que tem sempre uma certa solenidade e existe muito em barcelos a sra rosa fazia cavaleiros para os pres pios os reis magos e fazia rainhas princesas soldados mas tamb m existem cavaleiros do povo este tem o particular interesse de ter associado o lagarto que como a cobra est ligado ideia de virilidade e de fertilidade uma simbologia que vem da pr hist ria
5500262 tamb m uma pe a muito caracter stica que mistura cabe a humana com corpo de animal esta que deve ser dos anos 60 particularmente bonita h sempre muitas varia es que transformam esta figura numa coisa cada vez mais surrealista esta vai a tocar um instrumento mas nas costas outras figuras aparecem viradas ao contr rio relativamente ao corpo do animal uma pe a que a sra rosa fazia muito
5500263 h sempre um animal real na base mas depois h um processo de transforma o aqui h claramente uma mistura do porco com um lobo com dentes a ideia de ferocidade s vezes surge com os cornos do boi ou com a cabe a do carneiro uma sobreposi o muito caracter stica no figurado de barcelos e a sra rosa explora bem isto
5500264 uma representa o dos cabe udos das festas das aldeias do h bito de as pessoas vestirem m scaras para assustarem e para brincarem a m scara existe tamb m em todas as culturas do mundo o cabe udo a representa o dessa transfigura o no minho continua a ter hoje uma utiliza o muito frequente basta ir senhora da agonia em viana
5500265 chamei lhe aculturada porque uma mistura da tradi o das cabras de barcelos que s o j referidas pelo rocha peixoto no s culo xix e que todas as mulheres fazem que acabam com um feitio afunilado quase com corpo de ave esta foi claramente feita com base numa fotografia da cabra de picasso que algu m forneceu sra rosa pedindo lhe para a copiar depois ela continuou a faz la mas passou tamb m a mistur la com a cabra da tradi o local regressando s ra zes

5500275 initiated a genocide probe based on reports of actions committed by georgian troops aimed at murdering russian citizens ethnic ossetians living in south ossetia
5500276 the situation when one who committed thousands of crimes is characterised as a terrorist and another as a president of a sovereign state is very strange
5500277 in such a case there will be no trial against him he would get a certificate a ward and everything would be explained that he is nutty i fear such a development of events and i have an impression that this variant is being considered in the west
5500278 only muslims can use allah its a muslim word you see its from the arabic language we cannot let other religions use it because it will confuse people
5500279 we cannot allow this use of allah in non muslim publications nobody except muslims the word allah is published by the catholics its not right
5500280 in recent weeks we have seen malaysians of all ethnic groups demonstrating for justice and accountability the bns pr has been disastrous it has succeeded in alienating in turn workers demanding a minimum wage the lawyers civil society groups clamouring for electoral reforms backed mainly by malays indian malaysians and now the christians what better time from the bns point view to try and prevent all these malaysians from coming together so the coalition raises divisive issues and it is so ironic that it is using a widely accepted term for god to divide his people

5500291 people are carrying out breeding which would be first of all entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals
5500292 in some breeds they are paying a terrible price in genetic disease
5500293 the welfare and quality of life of many pedigree dogs is seriously compromised by established breeding practices for appearance driven primarily by the rules and requirements of competitive dog showing and pedigree dog registration
5500294 any dog may be shown but it is up to the judge to decide if it fits the breed standard
5500295 it is when characteristics become exaggerated that health problems can occur this is something that the kennel club does not encourage and actively educates people including judges against doing as part of its fit for function fit for life campaign
5500296 this humanitarian stuff we get lost in it were not combat effective

5500312 unlike previous disaster drills that have been limited to emergency responders this is a first of its kind campaign to convince every southern californian to be prepared for a huge earthquake which will happen one day
5500313 were going to involve schools chambers of commerce neighborhood watch groups churches and anyone else who wants to participate the response from those groups at this first meeting was very encouraging and exciting
5500314 everyone should take a look at www shakeout org to learn about this important effort

5500323 we do not know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express
5500324 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god

5500332 labours taxes and rising cost of living mean that pension increases for poor pensioners will be entirely eaten up by higher inflation
5500333 spend a much higher percentage of their income on high inflation goods like heating light and food
5500334 the truth is that gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made the country less fair browns labour means an unfair britain
5500335 this autumn we are going to step up the pressure to make sure that gordon browns obsession with his own short term survival does not do long term damage to britain that would not be fair
5500336 in 1997 the poorest pensioners lived on 69 a week today pension credit means no pensioner need live on less than 124 a week

5500467 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5500468 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5500469 unless tsvangirai signs on the dotted line the crisis continues not only simply because the billions of foreign aid does not become available but also because he does represent a significant majority of the zimbabwean population

5500471 our findings provide the first evidence of mirror self recognition in a non mammalian species
5500472 they suggest that essential components of human self recognition have evolved independently in different vertebrate classes with a separate evolutionary history
5500473 a crucial step in the emergence of self recognition is the understanding that ones own mirror reflection does not represent another individual but oneself
5500474 mirror self recognition has been shown in apes and recently in dolphins and elephants using the mark test we obtained evidence for mirror self recognition in the european magpie pica pica this finding shows that elaborate cognitive skills arose independently in corvids the crow family and primates taxonomic groups with an evolutionary history that diverged about 300 million years ago
5500475 on wednesday last week keepers noticed that claudio was very lethargic he hardly had anything to drink on friday and simply grew weaker and weaker he died on saturday
5500476 we cannot keep on taking away children from a mother
5500477 arizona for example has found that community colleges have found tremendous problems trying to document the legality of all students based upon a ban of undocumented students
5500478 we certainly might have to require additional personnel certainly its going to take more time for students to be admitted to programs potentially
5500479 we really dont know the devil is in the details but im concerned that if a permanent ban is enacted there will be substantial additional bureaucracy red tape additional resources would be great dollars that arent forthcoming certainly in this budget and dollars that would take away the success of students in the classroom
5500480 i can imagine that a permanent ban on enrollment of undocumented immigrants might require all students to document that they are legally here in the united states
5500481 that would require us to ask native born students perhaps to provide documentation that documentation might be a birth certificate and a birth certificate might not be available it might require a passport and that might not be available
5500482 in a years time wake tech will get about 40 000 applications
5500483 if you spent 15 minutes more on each one that would mean that you would need about three people three additional people working doing nothing else 40 hours a week
5500484 on the application they are asked a series of questions
5500485 among those questions are are you a u s citizen and if not then it asks what is your immigration status and it lists the different categories of immigration status on their application
5500486 who apply for admission to our programs have to provide evidence of their high school graduation
5500487 if a student is not a graduate of a north carolina or a united states high school they have to provide documentation if they indicate a place of birth other than the united states they have to provide documentation in our admissions process

5500496 we expect 10 more trusts to be in the formal consultation stage by september and a minimum of 100 schools to be up and running within two years
5500497 schools that collaborate with other schools colleges universities businesses and the wider community are already seeing the benefits i think there is significant future potential for a cooperative model based on collaboration and a greater involvement of parents and the local community in the running of schools
5500498 i want to explore how we can create a new generation of cooperative schools funded by the taxpayer but owned by parents and the local community
5500499 although a new building would have been fantastic the majority control of an academy sponsor seemed to go against a movement for greater community inclusion and involvement
5500500 for some firms their aim seems to be to make money and influence the curriculum and policy to their advantage we are not seeking to mortgage the future of our children in this way
5500501 the trust allows parents to become involved in the school and gives more of a voice to pupils
5500502 other people who wouldnt normally be associated with the school can still get involved it brings the whole community together
5500503 i am confident the trust will build and improve on the way we all work together to improve the quality of life for our school our community and its residents
5500504 i think its really good for schools to work together
5500505 our values can make a difference in raising standards aspirations and achievements in schools
5500506 the schools specialist status and the strong link to the cooperative movement have had a major impact on standards and achievement

5500524 in eins gegen eins situationen erkennt man wie sich die st rmer vor ihm f rchten
5500525 ich glaube es war ganz okay aber in meinem alter ist es nicht mehr so wichtig ob man sehr gut spielt oder mittelm ig das einzige was z hlt ist der erfolg der mannschaft
5500526 ich habe die szene nicht gesehen und dies dem gremium am montag um 10 30 uhr so mitgeteilt

5500530 bei den vereinen anerkannt alle beteiligten in der rechtssprechung sind willens ihre aufgabe bestm glich zu l sen im sinne des fu balls
5500531 es gibt keine regel die verbietet dass du durch standard situationen deine tore machen darfst
5500532 ich habe das jahrelang mit meinem bruder dejan trainiert fast jeden tag
5500533 mit ivan rakitic christian pander und auch jefferson farfan haben wir gleich drei spezialisten dazu die kopfballst rke von marcelo bordon und kevin kuranyi wenn du ganz oben spielst machen diese details oft den unterschied
5500534 mir sind in der nacht viele szenen vor allem die schlechten durch den kopf gegangen wir h tten hinten einiges besser machen k nnen
5500535 ich werde niemanden nach einem schlechten spiel herausnehmen die jungs haben weiter mein vertrauen
5500536 lehmann hat den unterschied gemacht er war fast nicht zu bezwingen christofer sah dagegen bei zwei gegentoren ungl cklich aus
5500537 ich warte jetzt auf seinen spielbericht und die stellungnahme des klubs
5500538 wieso flucht f r den bvb zu spielen ist ein kindheitstraum das stadion mit den unglaublichen fans ist einfach sensationell ich habe schon die ausw rtsspiele dort immer genossen
5500539 die zeit dort war nicht schlecht aber lehrreich weil ich beim hsv nie eine richtige chance gekriegt habe
5500540 ja wie soll man selbstbewusstsein tanken wenn man immer nur 15 minuten eins tze bekommt aber ich habe auch keine lust mehr mich mit meiner zeit beim hsv zu besch ftigen das thema ist abgehakt ich will jetzt beim bvb wieder durchstarten
5500541 dass er mir die chance gibt zum bvb zu kommen ist toll ich werde mich in jedem training und spiel voll reinh ngen
5500542 klopp wird meinen transfer nicht bereuen versprochen nat rlich will ich in dortmund wieder h ufiger treffen
5500543 wir haben eine super mannschaft und einen tollen start erwischt ich denke der bvb hat eine truppe zusammen die den fans viel freude machen wird
5500544 wenn petric fit ist ist er nat rlich im kader
5500545 ich bin froh dass wir so einen guten spieler dazubekommen haben zidan war hier zwar auf einem guten weg aber wir haben ein sehr gutes gesch ft gemacht
5500546 wunschspieler w re vielleicht pel aber der spielt nicht mehr petric war top scorer 13 treffer d red in dortmund er ist ein sehr guter fu baller sehr gut bei standard situationen und sehr produktiv einen spielertypen wie ihn k nnen wir sehr gut gebrauchen
5500547 ich habe donnerstag eine stunde berlegt dann gesagt ja das machen wir
5500548 petric ist anders nicht wie van der vaart rafael bereitet viel vor mladen ist ein spieler der tore macht
5500549 eigentlich ist petric eine nr 9 er hat aber auch als nr 10 gespielt wenn alle da sind m ssen wir ein konzept finden in dem alle zurecht kommen
5500550 michael hat viel talent aber er ist jetzt in einer neuen rolle in der er sich zurechtfinden muss daf r braucht er zeit
5500551 er hat einen langen weg vor sich das ist jetzt eine phase die auch mit fehlern verbunden sein kann die gestehen wir ihm zu und dann sehen wir mal in einem jahr welche entwicklung er durchgemacht hat mit jedem guten spiel mit jedem nuller wird er selbstbewusster er wei er hat die volle r ckendeckung
5500552 wir setzen uns zwei oder drei wochen zusammen du erz hlst mir deine geschichte ich schreibe sie f r dich auf und das ganze erscheint in der quick als autobiografische serie
5500553 der oswin hat ja ein viel kleineres zimmer als ich
5500554 das sehe ich ich kenne dich doch rede mit mir h r auf mit diesem gr sslichen schweigen
5500555 ich will lieber einen gl cklichen vater f r unsere kinder als einen ungl cklichen ehemann wenn sie dir wirklich so viel bedeutet dann musst du zu ihr gehen sofort ich gebe dich frei
5500556 i just get a lot of mail and phone calls from people who just want me to buy their credit cards
5500557 its kind of hard because you really dont know what youre getting yourself into
5500558 i keep it pretty secure with locks and with passwords that arent simple to figure out
5500559 nicht n tig es gibt zw nge aber er bekommt bei uns auch seine freiheiten
5500560 claudio hat f higkeiten die man in der bundesliga mit der lupe suchen muss
5500561 ebert ist auf einem guten weg auf ihn kann man immer z hlen auch an einem schlechten tag hilft er uns mit seiner power was er l uft ist unglaublich und er hat wieder getroffen wie im pokal in trier wir brauchen diese tore aus dem mittelfeld auch seine standards sind viel besser als letzte saison
5500562 so stelle ich mir fu ball vor das war ein bisschen wie bei arsenal london
5500563 mit dieser leistung ist platz sechs in dieser saison keine illusion
5500564 ich habe mit ihm viel gesprochen er sch pft jetzt sein potential aus wir harmonieren sehr gut
5500565 ich habe conca in brasilien gesehen er kann im mittelfeld berall spielen ist aber kein favorit die frage ist ob er sich k rperlich in der bundesliga durchsetzen kann
5500566 die gesellschaftliche und wirtschaftliche bedeutung des fu balls wird in deutschland trotz aller sonntagsreden der politiker immer wieder unn tig in frage gestellt mich w rde mal interessieren was passiert wenn wie in den usa oder italien die liga streikt

5500575 bei nikolai muss man angesichts seiner gr e und schwere nach harten trainingseinheiten auch phasen der erholung und entspannung einplanen mehr als bei einem fliegengewichtler
5500576 genau die richtige entspannung ich schwimme sehr gern das lockert nach harten sparringsrunden auf und entspannt
5500577 wir haben uns das alles anders vorgestellt auch wenn hoffenheims offensive zur besten in der bundesliga geh rt aber eben nur wenn man sie l sst
5500578 wir m ssen ganz schnell wieder zu unserer form finden und die hei t nun mal erst k mpfen und dann spielen umgekehrt klappt das nicht das hat jeder gesehen
5500579 es gibt drei wichtige punkte f r uns wir m ssen endlich wieder kompakt stehen absolut die zweik mpfe annehmen und unsere gro e st rke die konter mehr einsetzen
5500580 wir werden das intern auswerten wenigstens wissen jetzt alle um was es geht ich wurde bel chelt weil ich nur vom klassenhalt geredet habe da wurde im umfeld schon ber platz zehn gesprochen wir haben immer druck jedes spiel ist f r uns ein finale
5500581 das ist nat rlich eine sch ne sache f r den klub wir sind froh dass wir auf dieser position so gut besetzt sind auch wenn robert mal was passieren sollte
5500582 es ist sch n mal wieder dabeizusein das zeigt mir dass ich in der vorbereitung gut gearbeitet habe ich will mich auch im deutschen tor zeigen und spielpraxis sammeln
5500583 ich muss mich ins zweite glied stellen aber ich habe gezeigt dass ich da bin wenn ich gebraucht werde
5500584 bei uns muss diese saison alles perfekt laufen um unsere ziele zu erreichen
5500585 daran ist im moment berhaupt nicht zu denken keiner wei wann wir mit ihm rechnen k nnen
5500586 hans hat noch nicht eine trainingseinheit mit der mannschaft absolviert
5500587 ich bin sehr entt uscht wir hatten 25 minuten sendezeit f r sie eingeplant und wollten sie feiern doch dann mussten wir in kurzer zeit ein ersatzprogramm zusammenstricken und aus dem garten des deutschen hauses noch schnell drei olympiasieger der letzten woche engagieren
5500588 wir wurden von ihrer managerin immer wieder vertr stet es gab keine zusage aber es sah sehr gut aus dass sie kommt

5500601 es botoxen vor allem m nner die in ihrem beruf viel kontakt mit menschen haben die also mit ihrer ausstrahlung und ihrem gesicht geld verdienen
5500602 m nner haben meist tiefere falten und st rkere muskelw lste
5500603 das hei t f r den arzt er muss mehr botox einsetzen im schnitt etwa 50 prozent mehr als bei einer frau
5500604 in einen muskel gespritzt blockiert botox die nervensignale die muskeln lassen sich gezielt l hmen etwa so dass sie die stirn nicht mehr in falten legen k nnen
5500605 ich lasse mir seit f nf jahren botox spritzen damit meine stirnfalten verschwinden das ist zwar teuer aber f r cremes die weniger bringen kann man genauso viel geld ausgeben
5500606 wird zu viel injiziert oder der falsche muskel erwischt kann das lid h ngen die augenbraue nach unten rutschen
5500607 these are my fu ing cars too by the way we didnt have to rent any vehicle
5500608 in dieser situation sagt man sich dass man sich liebt
5500609 wanted to be around people who could make me laugh
5500610 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5500611 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5500612 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5500613 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5500614 sex ratio and crime evidence from chinas one child policy
5500615 after watching the amazing things that have unfolded at the water cube over the past week i have decided not to cut my hair
5500616 instead i will be wearing a specially designed body suit from speedo which due to its advanced aerodynamic construction and specially fused seams will keep my body more rigid and streamlined and thus allow me to better achieve my object smacking homers
5500617 the thing is designed to keep in warmth so it gets a little toasty
5500618 our son is a drug addict hes a pothead and a loser and my heart is broken
5500619 i knew something was amiss when i saw that the socks were in the wrong drawer
5500620 they werent in the second drawer where they were supposed to be they were in the third drawer behind his sweaters which he obviously doesnt need now given that its the summer so i pulled them out to put them in the right place and thats when i found the contraband
5500621 were going to get the olympic committee together and figure out what the best thing to do here is
5500622 doping has been a huge problem in all sports and so it makes sense that it would even find a way to creep into our events nevertheless its a real problem that well need to deal with
5500623 its tough because everyone has such different views on this for example im in favor of a softer penalty the games must go on all that stuff sarah though shes talking about a lifetime ban so weve got some things we need to work out
5500624 why should we be forced to suffer due to the indiscretions of other athletes
5500625 we are not dopers so we have every right to enjoy our biannual exhibition of sportsmanship and competition do we not
5500626 its an unfortunate truth we will have to spend a lot of time thinking about the best way to move forward deliver some sanctions and move along the key is to make sure that we dont have repeat violations if you ask me
5500627 has sido revestido del nuevo hombre el cual conforme a la imagen de aquel que lo cre se va renovando hasta el conocimiento pleno
5500628 were giving people an education on the ground since this isnt a community of early adopters but we know theyre eager to learn
5500629 snakes got a bad rap because of adam and eve were trying do them a service
5500630 that blew me away i was like thats the mayor everything is okay i can bring em out i can do that too
5500631 snakes are fascinating they move with no arms they eat with no fingers and theyre beautiful their patterns and colors you cant duplicate what god did on them
5500632 people like that i leave them alone you might catch a heart attack
5500633 i have people who come back after years they expect to see the snakes they have pictures of me in their photo album theyll have taken a picture when their child was like 5 years old and now hes 17 and they want to compare
5500634 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5500635 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5500636 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5500637 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5500638 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5500639 incendiare il cuore di qualche ragazza forse sarebbe molto meglio anche se non esente da rischi
5500640 its an old brand of nationalism that has been revived now that china is a major player in the world
5500641 everyone loves a winner theres a huge diaspora that had no reason to feel proud for the last 100 years most of them i suspect identify with beijings coming out party
5500642 last night we lost to former coloniser japan and today we lost to the communist bandits
5500643 dont buy into it its not for the good of the country they dont care about you dont buy into the nationalism its crap see look at me i hate bush in fact we all do we are still american and proud
5500644 so di avertelo detto tante volte ma se tu sei libera prima del mio compleanno ti vengo a trovare un week end
5500645 diese wahlwerbung ist sexistisch weil die nackten hintern lediglich voyeuristische instinkte bedienen das plakatmotiv hat keinerlei politische aussage
5500646 das plakat muss weg junge m nner erhalten durch solch sexistische aufnahmen ein v llig falsches frauenbild und eine ltere frau hat mich gefragt ob unsere gemeinde jetzt einen neuen puff bekommen soll
5500647 es ist bei der wahl mit einer geringen beteiligung zu rechnen das n tzt dann parteien wie der npd wir wollten aufmerksamkeit f r die wahl die alternative zu diesem plakat war ein sonnenblumen motiv
5500648 aber wir wollten auch junge menschen ansprechen und nat rlich haben wir auch auf den schmunzelfaktor gebaut
5500649 als ich vor ihrer haust r stand griffen mich pl tzlich zwei m nner an
5500650 ich schrie so laut ich konnte hilfe hilfe ein berfall
5500651 auch wenn diese m nner meine tasche mitgenommen h tten wertsachen waren sowieso nicht drin aber es ist eine schande dass jede woche ltere frauen wie ich in dieser stadt berfallen werden haben die leute denn gar keinen anstand mehr
5500652 es kann nicht sein dass an einem ort an dem hochrangige nationale und internationale g ste empfangen werden ein emblem des regiments hermann g ring prangt
5500653 wir haben in der stadt mehr als 20 000 abfallk rbe aufgestellt trotzdem kehren wir jedes jahr 90 000 tonnen m ll von den stra en und die bis zu 180 000 hunde in berlin hinterlassen jeden tag 55 tonnen kot
5500654 in friedrichshain kreuzberg gab es deswegen im ersten halbjahr zwei anzeigen
5500655 wir haben 40 mitarbeiter im au endienst doch hinter jedem busch k nnen wir nun wirklich nicht stehen
5500656 wir m ssen die verursacher in flagranti erwischen und selbst dann gibt es oft nur eine ermahnung am liebsten w re mir die leute w rden selbst merken dass es ihre stadt ist die sie verschmutzen
5500657 von kindern gibt es noch keine spur schlimmstenfalls finden wir noch zwei babyleichen
5500658 von umfang und gr e der nachgeburt muss die mutter mit den beiden f ten in der 30 schwangerschaftswoche gewesen sein die kinder waren mit gro er sicherheit also lebensf hig
5500659 au erdem wird er die leichtathletik wettbewerbe besuchen und bei einem empfang f r die berliner olympioniken teilnehmen
5500660 ich finde das wort stiefmama nicht so sch n es klingt irgendwie gar nicht nett
5500661 ich habe eine idee du bist jetzt einfach unsere nora gell papi die nora ist jetzt unsere f r immer frau
5500662 wir lieben sie ber alles sie hat berhaupt nichts von einer b sen stiefmutter sie ist eine wunderbare frau und hat unseren vater sehr sehr gl cklich gemacht
5500663 wenn mein vater gl cklich ist bin ich es auch
5500664 ein mutterersatz waren die freundinnen meines vaters nie aber katja und ich verstehen uns sehr gut
5500665 man muss versuchen den kindern des partners eine freundin zu sein der versuch in konkurrenz zur mutter zu treten ist gef hrlich
5500666 ich musste erst lernen nicht mehr immer die nummer eins zu sein fr her konnte ich es nicht einmal ertragen bei einem partner die nummer zwei zu sein heute komm ich auch gern an stelle drei oder vier wenn die familie vorrang hat
5500667 der einsatz gegen meinen ex verein ist sehr unwahrscheinlich die f den m ssen ja noch raus
5500668 marko hat sehr mannschaftsdienlich gespielt er hat riesig gek mpft als einzige spitze gegen f nfzehn zentimeter gr ere spieler toll gegengehalten und beide tore vorbereitet f r mich ist es sehr wichtig dass er nicht nur tore schie t er hat sich f r das team gequ lt
5500669 ich hatte kr mpfe in beiden oberschenkeln nichts ging mehr olympia hat seine spuren hinterlassen
5500670 das war eine riesige erfahrung die erste woche waren wir in shanghai danach eine woche in peking im olympischen dorf ich habe stars wie die basketballer dirk nowitzki kobe bryant sowie die tennis profis rafael nadal und novak djokovic getroffen und gesprochen unglaublich
5500671 das team und auch ich haben viel selbstvertrauen so k nnen wir jetzt jeden gegner schlagen
5500672 ich hatte erst berlegt hinten neben stein kak und von bergen den jungen radjabali fardi aufzustellen aber mit 17 jahren das erste bundesliga spiel vor 45 000 zum saison start machen das w re nicht einfach f r ihn gewesen diesmal war die dreierkette mit simunic die beste l sung
5500673 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5500674 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5500675 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5500676 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5500677 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5500678 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5500679 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5500680 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5500681 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5500682 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5500683 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5500684 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5500685 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5500686 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5500687 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5500688 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5500689 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5500690 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5500691 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5500692 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5500693 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5500694 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5500695 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5500696 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5500697 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5500698 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5500699 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5500700 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5500701 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5500702 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5500703 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5500704 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5500705 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5500706 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5500707 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5500708 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5500709 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5500710 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5500711 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5500712 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5500713 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5500714 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5500715 failed to read the shader cache file missing or broken shdc file
5500716 you might want to get the car seat in the car this weekend
5500717 would not take any move to save the poor market
5500718 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs
5500719 we are starting to see companies going out of business after six to 12 months the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more but its a very slow gradual process
5500720 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5500721 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics
5500722 it seems hard to me to say that we wont see some sort of short term hangover at least
5500723 a great storm puts out a little fire but it feeds a strong one
5500724 era bvio que dwight ia nos colocar numa situa o dessas
5500725 michael nunca presta aten o aos relat rios quanto tempo alertei diariamente
5500726 algo tinha que ser feito eu fiz voc s j viram onde os fracos n o tem vez dei a chance a eles de se mostrarem fortes
5500727 n o me vejo nessa empresa por muito tempo sabe estudo administra o o cliente o rei michael se acha o rei s sou um tempor rio que posso fazer emprestar meus livros de gest o para ele
5500728 if id had my way i would have done it the right way
5500729 what you get is a real feeling of all the periods existing at once
5500730 grandmas dressed from the 20s grandpa may be dressed from the 30s and there might be someone who works in manhattan who has a very up to date look it works for hair clothing everything
5500731 we ended up meeting with several high stakes litigators in new york
5500732 and we set ted danson who plays arthur frobisher up with some ceos of billion dollar companies including a couple of billionaires in their own right
5500733 as we got more and more into our research talking to these attorneys and reading accounts of corporate scandals we found it really supported our desire to show how much destruction is left in the wake of these cases
5500734 more can be achieved through familiarity which we were very happy to uncover in our research
5500735 they exist to promote accurate information in the media about medical and health issues its an incredible resource
5500736 medical adviser dr john sotos threw us a small factoid about three quarters of the way through breaking a story
5500737 there was this particular medication that treats the disease we were looking into and it happened to be fatal to dogs we took that and ran with it
5500738 we not only killed the dog we killed the patient
5500739 those have struggles of obsession survival and possession which we feel is what the show is really about

5500745 theres no shame in getting an epidural at eight centimeters
5500746 its the women who come in and beg for an epidural at 2 centimeters that we kind of roll our eyes at

5500748 well then choose the job that is going to put you in the best position for that future
5500749 of course you can have some time off when the baby arrives will three days be okay
5500750 yep well both be in boot camp for a solid year
5500751 the btec is perfect for the young person who knows they want to go into certain occupations
5500752 a lot of young people dont know what they want to do
5500753 there is an advantage for them in the diploma in that it wont tie them down too much it will give them general skills and a flavour of a sector
5500754 it was a defining moment of the worst kind imaginable
5500755 although we encourage candidates to draw upon examples from every part of their lives some candidates provide information that is inappropriate
5500756 for instance candidates have divulged intimate details regarding parental affairs arguments with their partners and their ostentatious and party hard lifestyle
5500757 i possess excellent memory skills good analytical skills memory skills
5500758 i am someone who knows my own destiny but i have no definite long term plans
5500759 it is a nice company and it has to do with business
5500760 i was closely involved in every aspect of my former company right up to its bankruptcy
5500761 ich esse meistens nur m sli fette sachen sind tabu
5500762 trotz der zwei niederlagen habe ich einen guten eindruck der zusammenhalt ist besser wir haben super charaktere dazubekommen brauchen noch ein zwei wochen feinschliff
5500763 ich bin nach spielen kaputt liege aber lange wach dann lese ich zurzeit the secret das geheimnis von rhonda byrne
5500764 the short course undertaken primarily for the joy of learning
5500765 while nose picking behaviour in general appears to be a common and normal habit
5500766 it is necessary to determine the extent to which rhinotillexomania amounting to a disorder exists in the adolescent population
5500767 persons do eat nasal debris and find it tasty too
5500768 some people poke their nose into other peoples business i made it my business to poke my business into other peoples noses
5500769 scenes more redolent of a bear garden than a meeting of a respected conservative organisation
5500770 if the swinton circle is in self destruct it will be entirely due to you alan harvey
5500771 we expect 10 more trusts to be in the formal consultation stage by september and a minimum of 100 schools to be up and running within two years
5500772 schools that collaborate with other schools colleges universities businesses and the wider community are already seeing the benefits i think there is significant future potential for a cooperative model based on collaboration and a greater involvement of parents and the local community in the running of schools
5500773 i want to explore how we can create a new generation of cooperative schools funded by the taxpayer but owned by parents and the local community
5500774 although a new building would have been fantastic the majority control of an academy sponsor seemed to go against a movement for greater community inclusion and involvement
5500775 for some firms their aim seems to be to make money and influence the curriculum and policy to their advantage we are not seeking to mortgage the future of our children in this way
5500776 the trust allows parents to become involved in the school and gives more of a voice to pupils
5500777 other people who wouldnt normally be associated with the school can still get involved it brings the whole community together
5500778 i am confident the trust will build and improve on the way we all work together to improve the quality of life for our school our community and its residents
5500779 i think its really good for schools to work together
5500780 our values can make a difference in raising standards aspirations and achievements in schools
5500781 the schools specialist status and the strong link to the cooperative movement have had a major impact on standards and achievement
5500782 given her needs they felt they couldnt guarantee sams safety still i was absolutely gutted
5500783 the carers were nice but the activities on offer were totally inappropriate there was no progression it seemed more about keeping sam occupied than helping her move on
5500784 since i started the course i feel like a grown up person im an adult now not a baby
5500785 the frustrating thing is that after two years with us some of our young people do get to the point where they are ready to work
5500786 they need some support to get started perhaps for someone to work alongside them for a few weeks or months but there is no funding for that fast forward a few months and they can be back to square one
5500787 the funding dried up after a year and that was the end of that
5500788 unfortunately as a society weve developed low expectations of people with learning disabilities its not uncommon to see people with learning disabilities working in your local supermarket but thats not the only job they can do
5500789 they can be such a great asset they are highly motivated reliable have a positive attitude a good work ethic and can offer a good length of service
5500790 in our print shop they are creasing folding stapling packaging and stuffing envelopes in the cycle shop weve been able to train young adults with learning difficulties to do routine bike servicing dismantling lubricating reassembling the bikes
5500791 for those with learning disabilities a reasonable adjustment might be to offer a verbal application process and a trial period
5500792 some people think that im heartless putting my daughter into residential care but actually im giving her some independence moving her on
5500793 shes in a more stimulating environment she has friends shes been to see mamma mia had a caravan holiday gone bowling and learned circus skills shes learned to make her bed shes done ironing id never have been able to do that with her at home
5500794 what is important at this stage is that she is progressing becoming more independent and leading a full life which she has every right to do i realise we are lucky if we lived in a different part of the country it could have been a completely different story
5500795 in the past for certain subjects we have been able to accept a limited number of near miss applicants
5500796 students ask more about the career paths that the degrees will lead to and the soft skills theyll gain we have very thoughtful discussions with many of them
5500797 i try to calm them down and to tell them that everything is going to be fine this is not the end of the world
5500798 no significant change in the ethnic social class or age profile of accepted applicants
5500799 the end state requirements are not known at programme initiation
5500800 i think we pakistanis need to be a little more patient with our democrats and a little less patient with our dictators
5500801 the main difference between my informal education at home and my formal education at college has been that at home i can focus on what i want to learn when i want to learn it
5500802 there were never any lessons at home or anything structured for more than a couple of weeks
5500803 days go by in the same way that they would in the summer holidays for other children
5500804 one of my children might be outdoors with the chickens another may be looking after the pets and the third may be on the computer
5500805 the ease naturalness and immense intellectual potential of informal learning up to the age of middle secondary school means they can learn certainly as much if not more
5500806 doing nothing observing having conversations exploring and through self directed learning
5500807 its products are often intangible its processes obscure its progress piecemeal
5500808 there are false starts unrelated bits and pieces picked up interests followed and discarded sometimes to be taken up again sometimes not yet the chaotic nature of the informal curriculum does not appear to be a barrier to children organising it into a coherent body of knowledge
5500809 yet the lack of information quality control does not appear to lead to muddled confused children
5500810 in some ways it may be an advantage because rather than presenting knowledge in neat packages the informal curriculum forces learners to become actively engaged with their information to work with it move it around juggle ideas and resolve contradictions it is not a static thing contained in a series of educational folders it is alive and dynamic
5500811 i provide materials resources help with research discuss what they are reading and what i am reading watch documentaries with them have stimulating conversations listen a lot and answer questions
5500812 helping with the cooking and shopping and collecting supermarket trolley money
5500813 she came to appreciate the value of material goods but she did not see it like that
5500814 she saw only the concrete activity if she did sometimes count money or do sums in her head it was her decision sparked by her emerging understanding or simple curiosity about numbers
5500815 the point is that maths certainly most of what is acquired at the primary level can be learned as an integral part of everyday concrete activities in school maths has to be divorced from the dynamic realities of everyday life
5500816 there is no developmental or educational logic behind the radical change in pedagogy from informal to formal when children start school
5500817 the young people had the personal skills to make the transition with apparent ease
5500818 the curriculum opens up a number of ways we can understand it history science art maths its very important that we give all young people the opportunity to engage with all subjects whether they immediately occur to them or their parents or not schools have developed ways of condensing canons of literature for example and introducing it in sequence to children
5500819 its very important that parents have the option to home educate their children but i wouldnt advise it
5500820 der richter entschied unter umst nden berfl ssigerweise in einem
5500821 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5500822 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5500823 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5500824 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5500825 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5500826 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5500827 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5500828 since returnable packaging options reduces or eliminates the need to assemble cardboard boxes associated labor costs are immediately reduced this type of lean manufacturing and distribution metric is quantifiable and makes this environmentally sound decision a good business choice as well
5500829 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5500830 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5500831 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5500832 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5500833 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5500834 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5500835 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5500836 a number of individuals were detained and questioned as a result of a proactive operation
5500837 consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder the two females arrested and charged last week are still in custody at her majestys prison
5500838 we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody
5500839 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5500840 we are not going to make any further comment at this time and we would ask that the media continues to respect our privacy
5500841 earlier today we informed the families of ben and catherine mullany of the latest developments in antigua the force is continuing its support of the ongoing investigation and trained family liaison officers are continuing to support the families and keep them fully updated on events both in the uk and antigua
5500842 the whole country was in shock from this terrible crime
5500843 these charges will bring some degree of relief to the families of the victims the community and everyone who values life
5500844 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5500845 today parliament has become sovereign we can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy
5500846 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5500847 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5500848 theres no stable settlement these two guys sharif and zardari will now start slugging it out
5500849 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5500850 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5500851 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5500852 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5500853 hey lady i already smiled for pictures with 4 of my cousins 7 of my aunts uncles mom amp dad did a photo with my own family took some alone and ate a cupcake with my cousins cant i please be done now
5500854 one of humanitys great conquests is the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination
5500855 and therefore also to italy where sorry to say there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden
5500856 solving the prisoner problem paves the road to solving other issues in peace negotiations
5500857 i dont read press i dont go on the internet much im just not into it its like the lost art of keeping a secret but it keeps my tunes closer to me and other people

5500859 my names will bevan im from south london im keeping my head down and just going to finish my next album
5500860 the mercurys have become an increasingly important showcase for new artists and esoteric music offerings enabling them to connect with a much wider audience
5500861 historically the lesser known and more leftfield acts tend to show the biggest pickups partly as their album sales start from a relatively low base but also due to the increased profile among mainstream music buyers that the nominations generate
5500862 the volcanic origin of the island makes being there an emotional interior journey
5500863 when i first visited lanzarote i found the landscape profoundly disturbing i had never seen colours so dramatically dark and i so fond of brilliant clashing colours was fascinated by the subtle obscurity of the place black had never formed part of my palette
5500864 the authorities here are not doing this because they like films but because they like money we will film their streets their people and export the image of the canaries making films is the best way to make money
5500865 the canaries have suffered a downturn in property prices in keeping with the rest of spain but the presence of almod var in lanzarote has already created a stir in terms of the amount of enquiries we are getting for properties
5500866 with the current business challenges and tightening budgets weve decided to focus our advertising and promotional dollars on activities that reach customers in the most impactful ways
5500867 the academy awards was a very good platform in the past but is not part of our 2009 business plans
5500868 anybody who is writing off general motors isnt looking at the facts and is probably hoping
5500869 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5500870 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar non believers with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5500871 the material in their possession promoted extreme ideology most notoriously of osama bin laden of al qaida as well as groups in various countries that adopted it
5500872 these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism

5500875 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5500876 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5500877 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5500878 two women came in and said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help
5500879 its horrifying that a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5500880 hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa
5500881 were all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5500882 we have always said that china is not an export led economy it is driven by domestic demand we think the supply side is going to have a harder time keeping up with demand than people think
5500883 our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions rising input prices skills shortages and the further devaluation of the us dollar
5500884 i think there is a difference between those commodities more leveraged to the emerging economies and those more leveraged to the developed economies
5500885 to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility
5500886 the outlook still looks good even though there may be some impact over the next six months from the weakness in western economies bhp doesnt appear to be too worried because of the ongoing demand coming from chinas industrialisation
5500887 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5500888 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5500889 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5500890 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5500891 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5500892 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5500893 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5500894 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5500895 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5500896 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5500897 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5500898 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5500899 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5500900 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5500901 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5500902 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5500903 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5500904 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5500905 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5500906 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5500907 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5500908 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5500909 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5500910 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5500911 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5500912 this is a planning took where all things are going
5500913 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5500914 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5500915 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5500916 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5500917 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5500918 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5500919 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5500920 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5500921 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5500922 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5500923 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5500924 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5500925 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5500928 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty
5500929 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and the family go through
5500930 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5500931 i will never forget the day that the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said that stephen had been killed the night before it was a crazy atmosphere in school very sombre and chilling something like that really does hit home one day he is enjoying life talking about doing an art a level and the next day he is gone
5500932 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives if you go to prison now it will be a step in the right direction people need to know it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5500933 communities and youth centres also need to play a bigger part boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5500934 im delighted the fa and the england team are supporting our campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime
5500935 you can only solve this by working together the england players are role models for this generation and i hope their messages have a positive impact
5500936 fred bowling around the wicket to a left hander is about as hard as it gets
5500937 i was just trying to survive ive got a fifty in a full one day international ill settle for that
5500938 there is a strong case to give him an opportunity to bat at no3
5500939 in the past i always felt that the team was picked before we met up
5500940 but i dont think there are any automatic choices any more and it doesnt matter who you play for if you are good enough you will get in
5500941 fabio capello is very fair and you get the feeling that if you play well you will get in the team
5500942 im looking forward to the chance to be involved against the czech republic at wembley tomorrow
5500943 its a very professional set up when you are with the squad and that is the way it should be
5500944 i wouldnt say its frightening its an atmosphere of respect its not like a boarding school its enjoyable and the coach will have banter with you his english is fairly good better than what you might think from watching him on the telly
5500945 everyone in task force helmand is affected by the death of a soldier and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family at this most difficult time
5500946 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5500947 while it is unclear exactly what caused their death an investigation is under way what is clear is that taliban fighters were in the area and showed a total disregard for the presence of civilians near them
5500948 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing
5500949 as a reporter i saw a lot of needs and at times you write about areas of society that need help and problems that need to be fixed
5500950 no my attorney told me not to say anything until all this is all took care of sorry
5500951 this type of senseless foolishness will not be tolerated on our highways
5500952 we just gotta watch the speed limits and obey the laws and try to make it home safely every day
5500953 the way it typically works out is innocent people who were doing nothing more than try to go visit loved ones or go home from work are typically the ones that wind up dead as a result
5500954 im sure that buying trousers is a problem that the sprinters have because they do have very well developed legs to put it mildly and im sure some of the slimmer line styles wouldnt fit them
5500955 the two guys who really stand out as being likely to have trouser problems are chris and jamie staff i would imagine jamie staff has major trouser problems theyve both got a very very well developed muscle mass
5500956 i see chris and jamie around the office and they wear quite normal jeans and things like that i just think that they would probably struggle with some of the fashion type trousers if you see the legs close to they are incredibly impressive im sure that a tailor would be extremely shocked
5500957 a lot of yam banana and dumplings produce top three
5500958 i couldnt miss one day in church and my mom and dad still call to see if im going to church
5500959 its a mindset were small and were poor but we believe in ourselves
5500960 romero is the only british woman to medal in two different sports
5500961 i woke up around 11 i watched television and then i had some chicken nuggets for lunch i went back to my room i slept for two hours i went back for some more nuggets and came to the track
5500962 assuming you eat them its highly unlikely that theyll help
5500963 if i hadnt done it today i dont know where i would be
5500964 in terms of being able to hurt yourself boy oh boy
5500965 i had to face my demons grit my teeth and ride the best race of my life and i did it
5500966 standing up and being sick because i was more nervous than ive ever been in my life
5500967 weve lived there all my life we love living there and we wouldnt ever move
5500968 scared of the sea im absolutely petrified its the unknown i cant stand fish
5500969 he phelps is so amazing im just glad that ive done what ive done at a games with him so i get to tell my grandchildren that i was there when michael phelps got his eight gold medals
5500970 if medals were given out for sheer guts paula would win gold
5500971 im so proud of her shes an inspiration she showed the true meaning of the olympics and should now be a contender for spoty
5500972 i was told by his teacher michael cant sit still michael cant be quiet michael cant focus
5500973 a more equal playing field there should be the same number of medals for women as men all sports should be contested by both sexes half the volunteers should be women and there should be a dramatic increase in the number of female coaches
5500974 i think i had the idea in 1996 or 1997
5500975 i went to the games in 1996 and the logo at the time was just the lion and the rings but we werent strong enough as a brand to just be a lion and the rings so coming back i wanted to find something that was less of a mouthful and also had that team feel we looked at the options and came up with team gb
5500976 when the athletes arrived they saw that and they knew they were part of a bigger team not just a group of athletes or swimmers that had a positive effect on everyone
5500977 there is a risk with gas but there is a bigger risk having no power
5500978 there should be no question in our country of choosing between bear and man
5500979 we must find a balanced means of coexistence on the one hand the presence of bears in the pyrenees reflects a willingness to protect biodiversity on the other the support of the local population is essential
5500980 the animals have been transported to a territory they are not used to
5500981 how can you be a personal fitness trainer and your baby mama is out of shape

5500987 one its the ingredients when you cut corners you can tell two preparation in italy theres a big focus on digestability
5500988 its the love of food and sitting around the table and enjoying a leisurely meal
5500989 let us be clear if there is no council tax in scotland there will be no council tax benefit
5500990 when there is no council tax then there is no council tax benefit
5500991 there can be no question of council tax benefit being removed from scotland
5500992 treasury documents show that 400 million of council tax benefit belongs to scotland
5500993 administration and funding of housing benefit and council tax benefit
5500994 if in scotland the council tax were replaced by a local income tax council tax benefit would cease
5500995 would no longer have to pay council tax benefit in the case of a full replacement lit
5500996 14 following discussion with dwp officials and receipt of legal advice we would not expect eligibility for council tax benefit to be affected by the proposed changes
5500997 a stringent social critic of the finest order who always stood up for the underdog by exposing the hypocrisy of the middle class

5501006 we will have to downscale every activity of everyday life from farming to schooling to retail trade epidemic disease and faltering agriculture will synergize with energy scarcities to send nations reeling

5501020 dear diary now i think i have a crush on so and so
5501021 daar moet je teveel weten over het nieuws weten en alleen maar schrijven
5501022 ik vind dat ze nog beter moeten nadenken over de inhoud van bepaalde vakken en wat ze ons met het vak willen leren sommige vakken zijn nu nogal chaotisch en we weten niet wat er nou precies van ons wordt verwacht dat is erg lastig
5501023 docenten zijn nog wat aan het experimenteren met de vakken op welke manier kan je het beste een vak geven en wat voor onderdelen allemaal komen aan bod vooral in het eerste blok met het van basisvaardigheden photshoppen ging het helemaal verkeerd veel onduidelijkheden en we hebben er vrij weinig geleerd
5501024 het lijkt mij een leuke periode omdat we dan echt aan iets gaan werken waarvan je het resultaat kan zien van alle periodes

5501060 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat

5501062 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5501063 after seeing what happened in new orleans and that area i think early evacuation of visitors is important for safety especially in the keys where we only have one road out lives are more important than revenue

5501069 we have made our navigation system run on the iphone it looks good and works very well
5501070 we will have to look more closely to apples strategy before we can say more about what kind of opportunities this will bring us

5501074 its the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5501075 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5501076 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5501077 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5501078 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5501079 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5501080 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5501081 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5501082 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5501083 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5501084 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5501085 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5501086 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5501087 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5501088 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5501089 it is kind of frustrating wondering who the starting quarterback is
5501090 thats probably one of the most important players on the team is the quarterback now that weve got it all resolved and we know who the starter is then now we can get down to business

5501110 twenty nine free and independent nations of asia and africa are meeting in bandung indonesia to discuss racialism and colonialism
5501111 a stream of realizations claimed my mind these people were ex colonial subjects people whom the white west called colored peoples almost all of the nations mentioned had been in some form or other under the domination of western europe some had been subjected to for a few decades and others had been ruled for three hundred and fifty years the despised the insulted the hurt the dispossessed in short the underdogs of the human race were meeting here were class and racial and religious consciousness on a global scale who had thought of organizing such a meeting and what had these nations in common nothing it seemed to me but what their past relationship to the western world had made them feel this meeting of the rejected was in itself a kind of judgment upon that western world
5501112 i dont know but i feel that my life has given me some keys to what they would say or do im an american negro as such ive had a burden of race consciousness so have these people i worked in my youth as a common laborer and ive a class consciousness so have these people
5501113 the most useful line to be taken both diplomatically and publicity wise would be one of general sympathy hope for the conferences success and moderate expressions short of condescension of approval of this example of the growth of a sense of responsibility to and in the world of these new nations even though we may not agree with their methods or all of their aims in other words encourage ment not discouragement
5501114 the united states was thus participating in the afro asian conference although it had not been invited
5501115 the nations represented at bandung had seized a meaningful measure of power away from the europeans who had ruled the world for so long
5501116 the asian african conference deplored the policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination which form the basis of government and human relations in large regions of africa and in other parts of the world

5501124 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5501125 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5501126 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5501127 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5501128 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5501129 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5501130 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5501131 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5501132 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5501133 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5501134 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha

5501140 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
5501141 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
5501142 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land

5501252 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5501281 i created it for me first and then everybody else second
5501282 at this point in my career i want to do music how i want to do music the label dre and 50 played big roles in the creation of my first two albums but this one i created and it feels good i walk in the interscope building and they know the hallways clear mr interscope is in the building
5501283 i dont think theres any artist in hip hop thats better than me im pretty much the leader although i think lil wayne is the nas to my jay z wayne actually might be a legend already
5501284 yes ive had guns in my life in the past but not this time but people want to test you have you sent to jail someone threw me a line and i took the bait
5501285 to make a short story shorter prison is no place for anybody
5501286 nobody in jail wants to be in there and i dont think ill ever go back lesson learnt
5501287 it was eight hours to get in to see him
5501288 they bought me in like an animal to see her chains around my waist and everything

5501290 i co sign joel and nicole but benji i dont know what hes doing right now hell probably be mad at me for saying that we like benji just not his girlfriend
5501291 i think paris wants to be like nicole those boys are like real down to earth trailer park trash and paris wants that cos nicole has it i think shes jealous cos nicole has a baby and a nice home and shes not doing drugs
5501292 like the roc needed sigel like i needed my father but he needed the needle
5501293 i love my kids i think they can probably be as bad as they want without ever getting a whooping
5501294 you know my dad did heroin and he pretty much blames everything that he ever did bad on that what a sorry excuse
5501295 but kids need a father bottom line its too late for me and my father but its not too late for me to show my kids that this is how its supposed to be done
5501296 before i was born they was talking bout the game when its all said and done you n s gon quote me
5501297 hip hop gives and hip hop takes and hip hop stole a lot of my normalness so im going to retire because i love my family more than i love music

5501299 yep this is l a x and gone but l a x will be an album that lasts a lifetime
5501300 at this point in my career im pretty much a statue in hip hop i cant be moved
5501301 if youre coming to la you gotta go through me like the airport lax every time i come through there they know i can t be stopped
5501302 im the king of la and that will never change ill always be the game

5501336 we need the help of isps they have the technical ability to manage the flow over their pipes the good news is that were beginning to see some of these solutions emerge in particular in europe and asia
5501337 there is nothing inherently wrong with p2p applications which are legal technologies that are used and welcomed on our network we have consistently said that at amp t will not become an enforcement agent on the internet nor will we inhibit the ability of our customers to access any legal content they want
5501338 can you confirm that at amp t is not monitoring and has no plans to monitor its customers traffic or other online activities to detect possible copyright infringements
5501339 increasingly they will be partnering with us they will be doing deals with us
5501340 despite our best efforts we cant do this alone we need the help of isps they have the technical ability to manage the flow over their pipes the good news is that were beginning to see some of these solutions emerge in particular in europe and asia

5501342 this agreement demonstrates our continued commitment to provide the best possible support for our customers mvts has a demonstrated track record of providing excellent service in the ate industry at the same time it enables us to continue to implement efficient cost savings measures while we remain focused on our current product strategy

5501344 before commercial customers bring their unwanted chemicals to the disposal points they must call chemsal on 9604 7533 who will assess the need for any special arrangements to receive commercial quantities of chemicals and to let them know the fees for disposal

5501349 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5501350 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5501351 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5501352 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey
5501353 in 2004 consultants looked for sites with topography suitable for a central waste facility
5501354 the criteria for site selection included environmental acceptability central location large property holding good access and suitable topography and geology
5501355 there was no discrimination based on land ownership but there were more sites found on private land than public
5501356 sites like wanatta lane have suitable soil and hydrological attributes and with a more rounded land form at the top of the catchment are suited to development of landfills and allow for easier control of stormwater flows and management of any leachate flows
5501357 the consultant determined that 42 sites were worthy of further assessment and this was done together with the assessment of another three sites suggested by the community including one in state forest at south pambula
5501358 the site needs to stack up against the criteria as it is being assessed
5501359 a report provided to council on december 18 2001 detailed why the wanatta lane land was considered to have suitable attributes and this was confirmed by the later more detailed assessment in 2004
5501360 that is what prompted councillors to resolve to take up mr constances offer to identify potential sites that are in public ownership

5501367 i could probably play with it but the risk was that the tip of bone thats fractured could break off if does break off then thats a lot more serious and id have to have surgery and miss the rest of the year ill be pretty cautious about when i come back and then make sure its almost back to full health
5501368 the opportunity to collaborate across schools and other institutions to support quality teaching and learning has enormous potential for teachers and students
5501369 one of our great strengths as a community is the effort given in supporting others

5501423 we were being ultra conservative to make sure that we had our numbers validated by the third party
5501424 today we have enough contingent resource for our 10 000 barrel a day project which we are moving full speed ahead on
5501425 and then as we do more exploration drilling and push the boundaries of that project further out on to our other land then we will expand our project to 20 000 30 000 and so on
5501426 we d certainly look at all those opportunities but it would have to be accretive to us it would have to be where we thought that partner would bring some form of value to us as well
5501427 that s usually a point when other players are savvy in the business would like to take over
5501428 there s quite a number of these early stage oilsands companies that are undercapitalized and have significant resource opportunities in this current capital market they haven t performed particularly well

5501434 while run of river power is promoted as green the reality is these projects can cause massive damage to b c s watersheds and wilderness through the cutting of trees for power lines and roads and diverting up to 90 per cent of a river s flow through kilometres of pipe

5501440 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out

5501463 the effect is to give the commission more control and the governor less
5501464 we are excited to offer 16 home games to our fans this season
5501465 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5501466 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5501467 i have no disappointments whatsoever about coming into the international game at this stage of my career
5501468 late or not any time you make the scotland squad is a good time i didnt manage to push my way in when alex mcleish was in charge because the team was doing so well thats quite understandable
5501469 and even if i had and won a bundle of caps i would never consider myself an established first pick you cant do that with the national team or with your club every game you play is another trial another opportunity to prove you belong there
5501470 if youre playing with a very good team such as celtic and scotland its obvious youre going to be surrounded by good players all competing for places its a question of doing enough to get in in the first place and treating every match thereafter as if your future depended on it which it does you cant ever take your selection for granted
5501471 sure you can look at previous experiences and look to repeat the good things you did and try to avoid the not so good
5501472 but looking back i think our only drawback was that we were extremely unlucky we did very well as a squad and some of the performances and results were unbelievable i think if we can avoid bad luck well have a good chance in the world cup qualifying we are organised and we have some very good players
5501473 i suppose the manager is taking a bit of a chance with me
5501474 i had been playing in midfield when i was asked to fill in at centre half when somebody got injured so im still learning to be a defender although i suppose youll do that throughout your career
5501475 for me though its good that somebody like jackie mcnamara has come to falkirk you can learn a lot from him and of course the manager john hughes has also been a massive influence and im absolutely certain that ill learn plenty just being part of the national squad
5501476 we hid in the bushes at the back of our house until 1pm
5501477 i condemn the dastardly attack and the violence sowed by the milf early this morning in some towns of lanao del norte

5501479 illegal and they were ordered by rebel leaders to vacate the areas they attacked
5501480 but renegade or otherwise it amounts to an affront to our national government even the rebel leadership agrees with us that these renegade groups are breaking the law and we must make every effort to make sure that these things do not succeed
5501481 but if it continues this way i think we will have to seriously take a look at the whole situation are we talking to the correct people
5501482 really i had no idea there were places in lebanon like that

5501485 michael is a player with talent he always has been
5501486 but at times i think he has been his own worst enemy he is a very demanding lad very demanding of himself that was a drawback for him in the past he wasnt channelling his aggression and focus in the right manner
5501487 but i have seen a change in michaels outlook he seems more mature now
5501488 maybe he needed a bit of direction in his career and he seems to be responding to the new manager at hearts he had a reasonably good season last year and i have always liked michael as a player he is a very intelligent man and im pleased he is starting to realise his potential
5501489 its very important that we win and take the feel good factor with us into the match in macedonia
5501490 results are always important with the national team although you will ultimately be judged on competitive matches
5501491 we are very much a nation which likes to play on the front foot and have a competitive edge
5501492 thats one of the reasons we have struggled in friendly games in the past i played in friendlies at hampden under berti vogts with only around 15 000 people in the stadium and you definitely miss having that edge to the game
5501493 hopefully there will be a decent crowd there on wednesday night and we can recreate a competitive edge to the match
5501494 im sure there will be movement over the next few weeks and if the right opportunity doesnt come along then i may have to reconsider and look to go down a different avenue im training at celtic and feel my fitness level is getting back to where it should be
5501495 i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5501496 quite the opposite they are spreading out to other regions
5501497 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5501498 if they call this a pull out then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5501499 we are aware that the georgian side can undertake provocative actions at any moment against our troops as well as the civilians
5501500 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response we have all the necessary resources political economic and military
5501501 we are not opposed to the americans and i know they have their own fears but any policy devised to deal with these issues should not be perceived as an american issue

5501513 he was trying to cross the bridge when a russian soldier at a checkpoint opened fire for no reason he was shot twice in the chest and once in the head we buried him the same day my father died fighting for the red army in the second world war and i served as a soviet guard on the turkish border i had never harmed russia why did they murder my son
5501514 we have come here from our village five kilometres away which has been destroyed look at this can one live like this in the 21st century thank god the russians did not let the ossetians in but where is the georgian army and the georgian government we have russians driving around in tanks in our city
5501515 the russian troops have been very kind they give chocolates to children and cigarettes to the men we are now afraid of what will happen if they leave we think the ossetian militia will simply come in and there will be trouble
5501516 we do not believe the trouble is over it is frightening at night and we can hear gunfire in surrounding areas we need international forces here as soon as possible

5501530 i have no disappointments whatsoever about coming into the international game at this stage of my career
5501531 late or not any time you make the scotland squad is a good time i didnt manage to push my way in when alex mcleish was in charge because the team was doing so well thats quite understandable
5501532 and even if i had and won a bundle of caps i would never consider myself an established first pick you cant do that with the national team or with your club every game you play is another trial another opportunity to prove you belong there
5501533 if youre playing with a very good team such as celtic and scotland its obvious youre going to be surrounded by good players all competing for places its a question of doing enough to get in in the first place and treating every match thereafter as if your future depended on it which it does you cant ever take your selection for granted
5501534 sure you can look at previous experiences and look to repeat the good things you did and try to avoid the not so good
5501535 but looking back i think our only drawback was that we were extremely unlucky we did very well as a squad and some of the performances and results were unbelievable i think if we can avoid bad luck well have a good chance in the world cup qualifying we are organised and we have some very good players
5501536 i suppose the manager is taking a bit of a chance with me
5501537 i had been playing in midfield when i was asked to fill in at centre half when somebody got injured so im still learning to be a defender although i suppose youll do that throughout your career
5501538 for me though its good that somebody like jackie mcnamara has come to falkirk you can learn a lot from him and of course the manager john hughes has also been a massive influence and im absolutely certain that ill learn plenty just being part of the national squad

5501542 when we merged the five campuses to form eec we had problems with connectivity on our old network
5501543 the main problem was bandwidth urgent e mails would arrive only hours later and we had difficulty with sending folders to each other
5501544 we built them an entirely new network which is now up and running with data and e mail they will own the network meaning that the r1 2 million they pay to us is a one off fee
5501545 we will be taking out all their analogue phones and installing 140 voice over internet pprotocol voip phones so that the five campuses will be able to communicate with each other without having to pay for each call

5501562 six satellite antennae have been installed on the site they are claimed to be trained on intelsat satellites over the pacific two satellite antennae and intelsat satellites over the atlantic and on inmarsat satellite 2
5501563 the fact that yakima was established at the same time as the first generation of intelsat satellites went into orbit and the general description of the tasks of the 544th intelligence group suggest that the station has a role in global communications surveillance a further clue is provided by yakimas proximity to a normal satellite receiving station which lies 100 miles to the north

5501659 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5501660 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5501661 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5501662 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5501663 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5501664 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5501665 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5501666 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5501667 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5501668 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5501669 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5501670 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5501671 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5501672 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5501673 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5501674 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5501675 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5501676 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5501677 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5501678 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5501679 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5501680 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5501681 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5501682 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5501683 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5501684 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

5501694 husbands love your wives just as christ also loved the church and gave himself for her that he might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word that he might present her to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that she should be holy and without blemish so husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as the lord does the church

5501701 she was certainly the voice of black society on the vineyard
5501702 i first came here in 1981 and it was only at the end of the summer that i realized that this was the same dorothy west who i had thought was long gone
5501703 once she called oprah when she thought someone had parked illegally in front of her house
5501704 i started the trail because many of my students were african americans from the vineyard
5501705 and there was almost nothing about the african american presence which goes back as far as whites
5501706 and a mother to my mother when i was 2 i started to dress myself with everything on backwards or inside out and say im going to dotties house later we would talk about everything and take walks she loved feeding the birds she collected stray cats i would practice my writing and reading with her but the richness of her house should also come from other people seeing its richness and seeing where that magnificent writing came from
5501707 they were in and out of each others houses constantly
5501708 oscars first taste of teaching was there the teachers husband died and she had to leave so they asked oscar to teach school he was 16
5501709 if you were lucky and had a specialty like music or art you had a chance to get a posting in the lower mainland
5501710 otherwise you went up north where conditions could be quite challenging
5501711 he rode 25 miles on horseback from the homestead he left on sunday afternoon boarded there all week and rode home on fridays after school
5501712 the woman he boarded with gave him canned corned beef sandwiches everyday for lunch for the two years he was there
5501713 a wolf kept pace with him about 50 yards away through the woods after that he always carried a rifle
5501714 the recruiting teams didnt come up very often but when they did come all the male teachers signed up oscar too
5501715 a week before he was to leave he got another letter saying that because of his ears hed been rejected they wanted the ticket back
5501716 this had an enormous effect on the town american crews came in to build the highway and all the freight came in by truck or train many of the truckers brought their families
5501717 one year we had a staff of six at the school the next there was a staff of 16 and each class had over 40 children
5501718 no es cierto que todo tiempo pasado fue mejor lo que pasaba era que los que estaban peor todav a no se hab an dado cuenta
5501719 sonamos muchachos resulta que si uno no se apura a cambiar el mundo despu s es el mundo el que lo cambia a uno
5501720 como siempre lo urgente no deja tiempo para lo importante
5501721 si lloras por haber perdido el sol las l grimas te impedir n ver las estrellas
5501722 y si antes de empezar lo que hay que hacer empezamos lo que tendr amos que haber hecho
5501723 comienza tu d a con una sonrisa ver s lo divertido que es ir por ah desentonando con todo el mundo
5501724 its a great day in the life of truett mcconnell college and georgia baptists the tmc board of trustees is extremely excited about the future of our school under the leadership of dr emir caner
5501725 dr caner is a scholar a professor a writer a preacher and an experienced administrator a powerful combination of gifts
5501726 at the same time he has a vibrant personality and is easy to know he has a contagious warmth is enjoyable to be with and is an excellent conversationalist
5501727 its a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward
5501728 i had completely lost hope because we were not finding a donor for three years we were so happy that we found the dhunjishas
5501729 our relatives refused to donate a kidney but doctors at hinduja hospital brought us and the dhunjishas together
5501730 my wife is a universal donor o blood group and i needed a kidney transplant when doctors told us about the shelkes we thought why not help another family as well
5501731 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5501732 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5501733 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5501734 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5501735 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5501736 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5501737 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5501738 who are open to doing something on the production side
5501739 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5501740 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5501741 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5501742 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5501743 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5501744 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5501745 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5501746 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5501747 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5501748 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5501749 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5501750 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5501751 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5501752 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5501753 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5501754 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5501755 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5501756 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5501757 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5501758 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5501759 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5501760 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5501761 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5501762 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5501763 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5501786 we can safely say this trend has risen four fold over the last few years some city hospitals are witnessing almost a ten fold rise in such instances
5501787 nowadays we often notice a certain superiority complex in kids barely three years old
5501788 threatening and swearing have become common among very young children
5501789 earlier we got one or two such cases in six months some kids suffer from passive aggression as well these get manifested when they hide their friends belongings to traumatise them
5501790 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is on the rise among young children this is due to an over exposure to fast moving images like cartoons and films and the onslaught of other media activities like video computer and mobile games
5501791 tourist guides crowd around foreigners and try to pull them or laugh at them we have received many such complaints of misbehaviour there have also been cases of molestation by the general public or service providers such as taxi drivers and guides this portrays india in a poor light and hampers tourism
5501792 to start two campaigns each telling guides how to behave with tourists so that they dont feel intimidated harassed or molested will be made the campaigns will also focus on how tourist places should be kept clean and damage free
5501793 as of now the situation is under control but we are keeping a close watch
5501794 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5501795 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5501796 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5501797 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5501798 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5501799 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5501800 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5501801 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5501802 on obamas best day he cant hold a candle to clarence thomass intelligence
5501803 we are facing the much larger issue of how russia plans to behave in international affairs for decades to come
5501804 on obamas best day he cant hold a candle to clarence thomass intelligence
5501805 lets see how you like it when we do it
5501806 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5501807 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5501808 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5501809 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5501815 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5501816 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5501830 i had learned what we all learned over there every man has his breaking point i had reached mine
5501831 a particular time when the vietnamese offered me the opportunity for early release
5501832 see the admirals son gets to go home and you stay
5501833 when found to be the son and grandson of admirals was offered early release he refused
5501834 in vietnam john mccain stood up to his communist captors and refused early release from prison in washington hes the conservative reformer attacking big government waste
5501835 mccain refused early release from prison where he suffered repeated beatings and was held for 5 1 2 years
5501836 mccain has been tested like no other politician in america as a prisoner of war he turned down an offer for early release because he refused preferential treatment
5501837 a t many of his mccains events his campaign sets up a screen and plays for the crowd a three minute film called service with honor telling the story of mccains more than five years of captivity in a north vietnamese prison after his navy plane was shot down in 1967 he was offered early release and he told em to shove it says one fellow prisoner of war paul galanti
5501838 when i was allowed the opportunity given the opportunity to return home early from prison camp i decided against that because i knew the effect that it would have on my fellow prisoners
5501839 when i was in prison in vietnam i like other of my fellow pows was offered early release by my captors most of us refused because we were bound to our code of conduct which said those who had been captured the earliest had to be released the soonest
5501840 john mccain shot down bayoneted tortured offered early release he said no hed sworn an oath
5501841 t he vietnamese came to me and said well allow you to go home early because my father happened to be a high ranking admiral our code of conduct said that only those go home early in order of capture it was a brave young mexican american by the name of everett alvarez who had been in prison a couple years longer than i had so i knew i had to refuse
5501842 one time when i was in prison in north vietnam and the north vietnamese came and said you can go home early because my father was a high ranking admiral i chose not to do that
5501843 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make and what was the process that you used to make it
5501844 it was long ago and far away in a prison camp in north vietnam
5501845 but i said no and ill never forget sitting in my last answer and the high ranking officer offered it slammed the door and the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was but not only the toughest decision i ever made but i am most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life
5501846 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5501847 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5501848 we work very closely with the military particularly along the border region and we would hope and expect that that would continue

5501850 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5501851 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5501852 weve been bringing bibles in for years and weve just seen a real crackdown in the last several months its almost like a defiance in the customs people almost like they are a law unto themselves
5501853 the chinese leaders keep telling the world the chinese people have religious freedom to even prevent them from receiving bibles certainly contradicts that claim
5501854 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english

5501877 a clear indication that the canadian economy is softening quickly
5501878 this environment poses a major challenge to markets and policy makers in north america
5501879 the household credit market is starting to reflect developments in the real economy
5501880 while on a year over year basis the growth numbers are still impressive the monthly figures clearly suggest that we are at the early stages of a softening trend in the pace of growth in overall household credit in canada
5501881 while we continue to see real value in owning the majority of our real estate assets carefully selected sale leasebacks enable us to monetize the value of select properties creating financial flexibility while maintaining our overall operating flexibility
5501882 the properties included in this transaction are locations featuring stores that are either new or recently expanded so we do not see a need to relocate these stores in the foreseeable future this enables us to monetize these sites at attractive rates while creating financial flexibility

5501915 the program is the first of its kind in the nation that makes sure homeowners and lenders avoid foreclosures where everyone ends up a loser
5501916 our goal is to help bring borrowers and lenders together so that the family gets to keep their home and the bank does not lose money on the loan
5501917 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5501918 oh god i will never find love again what will i do

5501920 we used to stay in grim butlins style camps but i always loved the area and bought a holiday home here 12 years ago when i saw that a caravan park was up for sale i knew i had to have it
5501921 it was a sight you see often on this coast an incredible setting on national trust land with views across the cliffs for miles but this prime site was covered in rusty old caravans and derelict barns
5501922 we have used modular builders to create proper solid buildings
5501923 its an incredibly friendly place and besides the odd amazing clifftop house which cost around 1 5million it is still a largely undeveloped area where it is hard to find good quality accommodation

5501938 would not take any move to save the poor market
5501939 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs
5501940 we are starting to see companies going out of business after six to 12 months the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more but its a very slow gradual process
5501941 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5501942 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics
5501943 it seems hard to me to say that we wont see some sort of short term hangover at least
5501944 global market presence for ocz high performance power supplies continues to grow rapidly due to our ability to remain on the cutting edge of both efficiency and stability

5501969 our current home is an ordinary 1976 townhouse in brighton that over the years we have been making more efficient
5501970 between 2003 and 2007 we reduced our energy bills by 60 per cent
5501971 last year we opened our house to the public as part of the brighton and hove festival to show just what could be done with an ordinary home we were told to expect about 10 visitors a day but we had over 100
5501972 builders and architects we approached didnt seem to understand what zero carbon meant
5501973 this was a great opportunity to see how difficult its going to be to build zero carbon homes in practice
5501974 creating a one off for a committed client is one thing but to build zero carbon homes on a mass scale at prices that everyone can afford is going to be really difficult if not impossible
5501975 we want to provide beautiful affordable energy efficient homes for ordinary people who arent going to want to go into the forest to chop down wood after work
5501976 an absolutely massive decision that few people will afford to make

5502003 the decisive new emphasis on the role of the bishops is in reality restrained or actually risks being smothered by the insertion of bishops into episcopal conferences that are ever more organized often with burdensome bureaucratic structures we must not forget that the episcopal conferences have no theological basis they do not belong to the structure of the church as willed by christ that cannot be eliminated they have only a practical concrete function
5502004 in the name of all the bishops unless each and every bishop has given his consent
5502005 cases in which the common law prescribes it or a special mandate of the apostolic see determines it
5502006 the authentic teachers and instructors of the faith for the faithful entrusted to their care
5502007 no episcopal conference as such has a teaching mission its documents have no weight of their own save that of the consent given to them by the individual bishops
5502008 it is a matter of safeguarding the very nature of the catholic church which is based on an episcopal structure and not on a kind of federation of national churches the national level is not an ecclesial dimension it must once again become clear that in each diocese there is only one shepherd and teacher of the faith in communion with the other pastors and teachers and with the vicar of christ the catholic church is based on the balance between the community and the person in this case between the community of individual particular churches united in the universal church and the person of the responsible head of the diocese
5502009 that with some bishops there is a certain lack of a sense of individual responsibility and the delegation of his inalienable powers as shepherd and teacher to the structures of the local conference leads to letting what should remain very personal lapse into anonymity the group of bishops united in the conferences depends in their decisions upon other groups upon commissions that have been established to prepare draft proposals it happens then that the search for agreement between the different tendencies and the effort at mediation often yield flattened documents in which decisive positions where they might be necessary are weakened
5502010 well the really powerful documents against national socialism were those that came from individual courageous bishops the documents of the conference on the contrary were often rather wan and too weak with respect to what the tragedy called for
5502011 it is obvious that truth cannot be created through ballots a statement is either true or false truth can only be found not created contrary to a widespread conception the classic procedure of ecumenical councils did not deviate from this fundamental rule at these councils only statements that were accepted with a moral unanimity could become binding

5502014 the workers have taken it as a challenge so thousands of employees of steel plants and collieries will also join the strike
5502015 we have been compelled to call this strike because this government purposefully ignored all our suggestions with regard to economic policy they cynically rejected the voice of dissent
5502016 our action will result in serious dislocation of economy and the government will be responsible for it

5502020 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5502021 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj

5502038 there are personalities in iraq who the iranian intelligence service and the qods force view as permanent enemies and that their elimination is at the top of the qods forces list of priorities in iraq
5502039 there are enemies who can be bought or forced to change their stands toward the islamic republic of iran by terrorizing or threatening their family members who reside in iran
5502040 caused their names to shift from the list of quasi friends to the list of enemies
5502041 it transpired to the iranian leadership that officials on whom it had counted are iraqis before being friends of iran even though they were allied with iran during the time of struggle they assume responsibility in their country therefore they refuse to serve as a tool in the hands of the revolutionary guard and the wali e faqih reference to khamenei
5502042 the revolutionary guard has begun to train iraqi shiite youths from the families that were deported to iran on the eve of the us invasion in the past the revolutionary guard trained some 10 000 fighters of hezbollah and the badr corps currently the badr organization throughout the war with iraq
5502043 however the fighters of the badr organization and the secret units of the islamic dawa party returned to iraq after the downfall of saddam hussein in the company of the late leader of the iraqi islamic supreme council ayatollah muhammad baqir al hakim after their return they joined the new police security and army units

5502048 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5502049 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5502050 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging in ways they havent even along our borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider this is not one that is cost free
5502051 that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world
5502052 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced
5502053 we are going to send a message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5502054 frankly russia cant have it both ways it cant act in a way that it did in the cold war when it was the soviet union and expect to be treated as a responsible partner
5502055 did you hear about the day i beat an olympic silver medalist
5502056 this is a case that has received a lot of negative publicity and the general population that could be on the jury is already contaminated
5502057 chris brummitt is an exceptional journalist with a deep passion for asia news
5502058 a great storm puts out a little fire but it feeds a strong one
5502059 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5502060 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5502061 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5502062 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5502063 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5502064 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5502065 we are setting the stage for then for further growth as we go from here
5502066 a seven day cruise is going to hit the western caribbean and probably grand cayman cozumel and jamaica key west those are all ports of call that are accessible

5502069 the liquid syabu was found in a carlsberg beer bottle a mineral water bottle and a 3 litre metal jerry can along with a bottle of methylated spirit a can of thinner and another of turpentine believed to be for processing the drug
5502070 the drugs have been sent to the chemistry department for analysis
5502071 those who committed criminal offences will be prosecuted while disciplinary action will be taken against those found to be in dereliction of duty he added
5502072 he escaped through the ceiling of the hotel room to the room next door he then called police
5502073 a team from the gombak police headquarters headed by chief inspector wan talib wan omar was despatched to the hotel we found two of the suspects crouched under the staircase
5502074 gender does not matter as long as the person can perform we will not hesitate to elect a woman as leader
5502075 it is not totally impossible its just that we have not come to that yet
5502076 it will not be an easy task as she will have to be very capable have strong grassroots support and a track record to boot
5502077 but for other high posts such as deputy president or vice president it is not a problem to have a woman in place i think umno members will accept a woman leader for these posts
5502078 malaysian politics is the same everywhere mic is no different
5502079 i dont think the men in mic are prepared to accept a woman in a high position even if she is capable and has all the leadership qualities they will try to get her out and she will be seen as a threat
5502080 my daughter has been traumatised since the incident yet the culprit is still roaming the streets freely it is unfair that my daughter has to go through all this at such a tender age i hope the police will act fast and put the culprit behind bars
5502081 i saw a male church member holding the little girls hand leading her to the female toilet i did not suspect anything amiss and went back into the building
5502082 my wife stopped her testimony and tried to calm our girl as she was shouting at the top of her voice my wife then took her to the back of the church and the man who had accompanied my daughter to the toilet followed
5502083 he immediately ran off after that we took our daughter to a nearby clinic and a doctor confirmed there were bruises and scars on her rectum
5502084 my daughter is so frightened now she has begun biting herself and us
5502085 all we want is justice to be served she does not deserve all this what saddened us is the fact that the police had not been forthcoming i will not give up i will fight till the end for my daughter
5502086 if i could ignore the seriousness of the misdirection i would have put you both in prison
5502087 after reading the grounds of judgment dont you feel like vomiting
5502088 there was no finding of facts stated by the magistrate as well as no means of evaluation of the evidence
5502089 he did not find out who azilah was working with on the day of the alleged offence
5502090 instead tonny admitted to having no interest in investigating the movement of the gun and that the investigation he carried out was for the purpose of prosecuting azilah
5502091 the police did not record any statement from a wasli saad the man who had a stall in front of the entrance to the crime scene and from witnesses in a nearby village the prosecution failed to prove the time of altantuyas death
5502092 the case must be mentioned today yesterday before a different magistrate
5502093 we have heard complaints that certain religious issues were pushed between the courts causing great inconvenience to the parties involved
5502094 it is un islamic because there is no such thing as swearing in syariah both should go to the syariah court
5502095 i believe he will make a good prime minister as he believes in democracy
5502096 this is my view and my view is shared by many indonesians
5502097 no we have our own troubles why should be look at other peoples problems
5502098 it is not us who are doing all this others posing as our supporters are responsible for this
5502099 we investigated and found it was not our supporter who attacked her but someone else who we dont even know
5502100 why do they accuse first and then report to the police why not go to the police first
5502101 i doubt the attackers were our supporters as our supporters were well behaved and orderly despite the huge turnout on saturday
5502102 we do not condone such behaviour and the incidents were undemocratic
5502103 he has been brave vocal and decisive on many issues why not be decisive in this case why is he shying away from an islamic way to clear his name
5502104 if he is innocent do it through the islamic option people are waiting why is he not accepting the challenge
5502105 the engine failed there wasnt anything you could do about it
5502106 it looks like we came out of it pretty good
5502107 as i should say my head shouldnt fall off in the next couple of days
5502108 it helped with being scared you just took the situation analyzed it and hoped it would turn out the way it did

5502138 hepburn and tracy kind of thing the witty stylish fond but confrontational relationship of brennan and booth
5502139 i think going into season 4 this should be the mark of what our show is you put these two characters in a misplaced environment thats where they operate best thats what brings out the best in their relationship

5502160 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5502162 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5502163 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5502164 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5502165 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5502166 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5502167 we want to maintain peace in the country but there are some bad hats out there and i want to warn them not to test our patience

5502173 i went in to defuse the situation and to confirm that the forum had stopped i was invited up otherwise how did i get in
5502174 i didnt kick the door and barge in but the picture painted now is as if i barged in and that is a total lie
5502175 when i was inside i did not say a word i did not do anything i was just asked to verify that the forum had ended i was just disappointed when some participants of the forum started using rough language on the others ngo representatives with me
5502176 dont invite any tom dick or harry you can talk about islam but you cannot talk for islam
5502177 i dont call any chendol or kacang putih seller to talk about hinduism do i that would only look stupid i would call the priest or the relevant authority
5502178 just because some mosquito group of muslims start talking about islam they represent islam i dont think that is fair
5502179 we have authorities jabatan kemajuan islam malaysia yaya san dakwah islam malaysia ikim uia why invite those mosquitoes

5502190 we live in a terrible world but russia is afraid of nothing
5502191 even among the liberals there has been no coordinated opposition to the russian offensive
5502192 most people think georgian president mikheil saakashvili is an adventurer attacking russian interests in the caucasus
5502193 i am convinced that right was on our side in this war even if our forces are not beyond reproach
5502194 propaganda in each country pushes the public opinion in whatever direction it needs
5502195 for russia to project its military force abroad for the first time since afghanistan it shows it is far more confident than ever during the post communist period
5502196 the general sense is that there is little the west can do to punish russia

5502279 this is a very history for us to try and come out like this and try and vote for the president of the united

5502282 who are these people and how do i get to my people
5502283 its been over forty years now kid get over it
5502284 there must be some country where they just love that spice and use tons of it in everything
5502285 this could be accomplished easily i would think with the turnpike authority and would commemorate the physical location and beginnings of the strong hispanic business community in dallas and this early history
5502286 it would be a major presence and also name a road that essentially has no real name today
5502287 it could be an economic boost for the community and also an opportunity for us to share our ethnic and cultural heritage
5502288 certainly weaker euro zone economic growth weaker u s weaker u k is bad news for emerging markets

5502292 can you produce one economist to support the gas tax holiday
5502293 the ads are less an effort to get votes than make a point and get it covered by the national media while obama has the attention of the nation
5502294 no doubt the obama campaign will do the same now
5502295 seriously do they believe this bs im john mccain and i approve of this message

5502298 is it just me or was that funny im john mccain and i approve of this message
5502299 sorry sorry its just so hard to stay awake during reruns of the democratic national conventions of the 1970s
5502300 what were out of time um ok im john mccain and i approve this message
5502301 recently a dad brought nine little girls in a limo i gave them little flip flops so they wouldnt mess up their pedicures
5502302 this is great for the hardworking families who were squeezed out of the market
5502303 i love it volunteering when i finish building mine home im going to stay with habitat you treat everyone and the building with more respect because you built it
5502304 im really passionate about this i believe that everyone deserves a place to live spending half of your income on rent is ridiculous
5502305 weve had people from the churches and teachers from the elementary schools come in and volunteer
5502306 we tried different types of food but we stuck to our diets
5502307 nothing went wrong we enjoyed each others company and i only lost 25 on the slots
5502308 one gentleman wanted to know why we didnt let people in atlantic city know we were coming so they could attend the class too
5502309 then we had smaller portions of potatoes turkey and green beans and water with lemon i didnt bother with dessert
5502310 we even had an apple cobbler with ice cream which i didnt think was excessive
5502311 because we enjoyed it without causing problems for our sugar levels mine were good the whole time i checked them

5502324 wake up call to other countries to prepare for such eventualities
5502325 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5502326 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5502327 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5502328 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5502329 even in retrospect obama would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5502330 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5502331 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5502332 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5502333 while the price tags on these products are fabulous i cant say that my hair was after using them if i use the shampoo and conditioner then blow dry immediately the results are fine a nice look and smell however if i wash my hair and let it air dry overnight the result is a greasy mess in fact thats what i did last night and today my hair feels a bit dirty

5502341 in other words there is no record of the transcripts
5502342 the victims were all very poor people living in old and dilapidated buildings
5502343 so far we have received reports about the partial or full collapse of as many as 890 houses
5502344 no one has been killed so far but flood waters have submerged parts of a highway
5502345 we are an independent country and we have interests what we do is to look after those interests
5502346 we hope we will conclude the talks in one month
5502347 intensive repair work is under way and the oil flow will resume in a few days if there are no other technical failures in the pipeline
5502348 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5502349 i believe that a future oriented perspective of cooperation in regards to turkey africa relations will come out of the stanbul summit
5502350 as turkey we researched and evaluated how we could reach this goal we have shared with you the turkey africa cooperation summit stanbul declaration and cooperation outline for africa turkey partnership which we developed from our evaluations
5502351 i know that no document can be perfect and flawless on this account we would be pleased to hear your views as to what kind of expectations african countries have of this cooperation with turkey and in which fields the outline and the basic elements of the cooperation will be formed accordingly
5502352 consequently the outline will reflect efforts which we will make within the context of implementation of the stanbul declaration
5502353 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response we have all the necessary resources political economic and military
5502354 i can say for certain when the new year will come but i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet
5502355 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5502356 lets hope that this is a technical slowness in getting implemented lets see the russians begin to pull back thats what wed like to see but we havent seen it yet
5502357 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5502358 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5502359 we are aware that the georgian side can undertake provocative actions at any moment against our troops as well as the civilians
5502360 we cant rule out the use of slavic looking people dressed like russian military for provocations and sabotage
5502361 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5502362 i am announcing now that iran is ready to launch satellites of friendly islamic countries into space
5502363 the bribery issue has become an ak party issue rather than one related to just aban di li

5502371 we believe social computing is the next wave of collaboration
5502372 the tensions have mostly eased i believe the negotiations will solve the situation
5502373 why do the cambodian police fight with the cambodian people but against foreign aggressors they become cowards
5502374 the government should solve the preah vihear border issue as soon as possible
5502375 we hope we will get some successes from this meeting we will try our best to get a fruitful result
5502376 at first i thought id have pants underwear on for the scene apparently not but ive sort of done that before on stage its all old hat now really

5502379 theres a massive interest and knowledge in the comicbook industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history where theyve intersected with each other and what their worlds are thats part of the education that were going through
5502380 these are big iconic characters so when you make them into a movie youd better be shooting for a pretty high standard youre not always going to reach it but you have to be shooting for it were going to make a justice league movie whether its now or 10 years from now but were not going to do it and warners is not going to do it until we know its right

5502383 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5502384 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5502385 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5502386 we said that if there is such a demand we should have it this organization this is how we set up the group in stanbul
5502387 we are not rivals to them nor do we desire to take on their duties we are only supporting the states security institutions we help them to complete certain things faster and get results some people are afraid to apply directly to the police for their own reasons we act as intermediaries soon we will set up a telephone line to report crimes all our work is done with the knowledge of the states own intelligence agencies they protect us we wouldnt have been able to do this otherwise
5502388 ive found loopholes but still i have to go through third channels to get it done
5502389 banking restrictions have obviously harmed our business but they have never halted outside trade with iran
5502390 i wonder how its possible to impose unilateral sanctions against a country that has land and sea borders with 15 countries
5502391 we dont want to antagonize our neighbor iran or upset our friend the united states we dont want to get very close to america and at the same time distance outselves from iran
5502392 the victims were all poor laborers and civilians this was a barbaric act carried out by the enemies of afghanistan at a time of celebration of independence
5502393 the terrorists showed that they are vigorously against the freedom of the afghan people and cannot bear to see the celebration of independence and the happiness of the afghan people
5502394 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5502395 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces afghan or coalition and government representatives
5502396 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5502397 there are feelings of brotherhood between the turkish and pakistani nations we hope developments in pakistan will help peace and stability there
5502398 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5502399 turkey is the most probable destination for pervez musharraf as it is the only country where he wont feel in exile
5502400 his choice would be turkey he is always welcomed in turkey and he knows he will feel at home here
5502401 and i dont think that musharraf will try to use turkey as a platform to prepare his return it is true that both slain leader benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif left their country with the intention of returning but both knew that there was a political future for them back in pakistan i dont think musharraf has such a future
5502402 turkey is not the old turkey that welcomes dictators i dont think there is any politician in turkey today who would hug a dictator
5502403 turkey is trying to improve its democracy to the point of being able to judge former coup makers in such a stage i dont think that we should have any place for a former dictator musharraf is familiar with the turkish language but i dont think that alone should be an incentive to host him in turkey
5502404 i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5502405 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5502406 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more

5502421 the doctors thought we were crazy when we mentioned that the hpv vaccine could cause this
5502422 something has suppressed her immune system so badly she can barely function the depression got really bad because she is experiencing a lot of pain in her knees now and cant do any sports she was once very active and right now can barely go to school we were told me her doctors that there is nothing more that they can do and that she could use a good psychiatrist

5502424 not only was gardasil put on the fast track and licensed quickly
5502425 but to say safety is assumed and you can give any vaccine with it is even more shocking

5502428 about a month after being vaccinated against the cervical cancer causing hpv virus 13 year old jenny tetlock missed the lowest hurdle in gym class the first hint of the degenerative muscle disease that 15 months later has left the previously healthy teenager nearly completely paralyzed
5502429 she must watch her capacity to control her own body gradually ebb away and each day her hopes of ever having a normal human life recede ever further into memory the disease is cruel beyond belief
5502430 lawyers last month filed the first two claims on behalf of girls with ailments blamed on gardasil under a federal program to compensate victims of vaccine caused illness the post has learned
5502431 it makes me mad because theyre saying how great it is but they never mention how many people have been hurt by it
5502432 protecting girls against cervical cancer is a fabulous thing but if this is whats going to happen they need to research it more
5502433 an event report does not mean that a causal relationship between an event and vaccination has been established just that the event occurred after vaccination
5502434 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5502435 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5502436 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj
5502437 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions

5502443 not all of them are bilingual in quechua and spanish and they did not believe that their weavings had any commercial value
5502444 in the beginning men did not allow women to sit in the programme meetings or even to enter the new greenhouses freely now we are at the point where women consider the re investments and profit balance as they develop small business tools

5502471 theyre taking a beautiful facility where people are comfortable and happy and now they want to take it away and put them into a new facility that is no more than warehousing them

5502474 what would you say if you were flying into memphis and they said you are about to land at isaac hayes international airport

5502477 thank god for isaac living 65 years and making a difference in our lives
5502478 hollywood didnt send its stars to us we sent our stars to them
5502479 isaac came from our culture he emanated our culture thats why he never lost his authenticity never lost his conviction
5502480 there would be no isaac hayes without stax and no stax without isaac hayes
5502481 if people have that type of attitude there its stupid
5502482 everybody has issues and makes mistakes or has things to deal with its about turning the page and moving forward and concentrating on whats in front of you rather than concentrating on whats behind you
5502483 hes close to being ready for us which is great
5502484 senator mccains proposal is bold its aggressive its an all of the above approach
5502485 senator obama has taken a very minimalist or none of the above or very few of the above approaches
5502486 pawlenty has called for a civil and respectful campaign and yet virtually every time i turn on the television set i see ads that are on the part of mccain that are grossly misleading
5502487 i personally believe that if barack obama gets elected he will slam the door shut on these options
5502488 if senator mccain is elected he will open the door to these options and allow our energy supply to be increased and take some of the pressure off our energy crisis in the country
5502489 midwesterners like authenticity and not someone who is phony or too glitzy senator mccain is authentic and if you look at how his issues line up with mainstream voters they line up more closely than barack obamas do all of those things are going to serve him well in the midwest
5502490 a lot of time has been spent and a lot of attention paid to public safety and security you havent heard much in our briefing about that because security is best carried out when not talked a lot about
5502491 its an incredibly simple yet innovative way to organize a stadium

5502498 we were in sydney getting ready for a training run
5502499 linford said lets go for a walk i said what id known him for 10 years and wed never gone for a walk before but we walked down the beach at manly and he said to me ive tested positive for nandrolone id never heard of nandrolone
5502500 linford had just come along to wave to the crowd really
5502501 we know about stuff like thg now but back then linford was probably being beaten to gold medals by athletes taking it and when he tested positive he was already a millionaire he had a big house and a nice car and he was a bbc pundit why would someone like linford christie take a poor mans drug
5502502 lewis had been giving it all that stuff about how linford wasnt the real olympic champion
5502503 on the night before the final we were all in the apartment me and linford and ron roddan his coach and i saw that linford was shaking i thought look at this this is linford christie and hes nervous but when he walked out into the stadium the next day he was a different man
5502504 hed been telling me to watch everybody and to learn from everything and thats what he taught me dont show people what youre feeling so when i cramped up after the semi final of the 200 in sydney i called christian over and said just walk slowly back with me i didnt want to let anyone see the people youre competing against have got to be made to believe that youve still got that power

5502551 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5502552 consumers are increasingly active and activist about where they put their money

5502556 despite rumors to the contrary 30 seconds to mars is not calling it quits we are incredibly happy healthy and very much together here in los angeles recording our new record besides this ridiculously overblown lawsuit courtesy of virgin emi we are having one of the most inspiring wonderful and exciting times that weve experienced to date more on that later beyond this distraction we are so incredibly grateful to all of you around the world that have supported us so passionately we would never consider stopping this just yet these past few phenomenal years have been beyond imaginable and we owe every single bit of it to you thank you all for that so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too a little history we had been signed to our record contract for 9 years basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than 7 years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities yes we have been sued by emi but not for failing to deliver music or for quitting we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here wed rather not air any dirty laundry but basically our representatives could not get emi to agree to make a fair and reasonable deal a few things to note if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even we think so that and other issues like the new regime at emi firing most of the people we know and love wanting to place advertisements on our website emi owning 100 percent of the masters of our record forever and basically having a revolving door of regimes at the company made it easy to not want to continue as is as the result of this takeover and the firing of over 2000 employees we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known after more than 5 regime changes in 9 years youd think we would be used to the inconsistency but the team that took the journey together for a beautiful lie was a very very special group of people and its a huge loss that so many of them are gone quick fact there is not a single employee at virgin records who was working at the company when we signed fyi virgin emi was not required to make this lawsuit public or to list such an egregiously and stupendously large amount of mullah in fact they were not required to set any price even close to this we did not want to take this public but we felt it best to explain our point of view to you our friends and fans in hope that you can better understand our point of view we would always do our best to avoid a fight but sometimes its important to stand up for what you believe in we hope that by doing whats right we can help to change things for the better for ourselves and possibly others p s we will always remain grateful to the people at virgin emi who were so integral to our success and we hope that above all we can find a resolution to this in as civil and kind a way as possible there are certainly more important things out there in the world to spend time and energy on to be continued jared leto 30 seconds to mars

5502559 theyre working hard and i think that theyre taking ownership in their jobs and i think thats important
5502560 theyre taking ownership in running their routes really knowing their assignments and understanding how to get open i think that the more that they do that and the more that everybody continues to work with one another the more comfortable well get and hopefully well get the results that were looking for
5502561 hes faster than ever and stronger than ever hes looked outstanding here in camp and done a really nice job
5502562 hes tough as nails hes a tremendous finisher he just finishes his runs as well as anybody that ive been around thats kind of what got him hurt hes going to scratch and claw for every inch every yard thats when he ended up getting twisted around in that middle tennessee game but thats who he is hes not going to change hes the guy who finishes 30 yards down the field in a regular team period he just has that kind of work ethic and that kind of want to to be great and to finish everything
5502563 we could see him blossoming last year but it didnt make a lot of sense for us as a team to take santi out there are some things that i probably would have done a little bit differently to try and get cary more involved in the games last year than having him be strictly toms backup
5502564 the biggest attribute cary has is his football iq you tell him something it makes sense he can make the correction immediately out there on the field when you coach him up on something theres evidence of it on the tape that he tried to do what you told him to do
5502565 he has a very good understanding and feel for zones hes quarterback friendly and hes got excellent hands
5502566 in this offense we enjoy those big targets inside those big tight ends
5502567 we want to utilize his skills because the quarterbacks can just throw it up high to him and its hard for anybody to cover him hes really got a good understanding of how to get open and hes got excellent speed
5502568 he can really go up and get it at a different level than heath
5502569 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators
5502570 the sample kept at the fbi lab was destroyed because the bureau believed it might not have been allowed as evidence at trial
5502571 now that dr ivins is dead and he wont have a trial no evidence will ever be admitted have you destroyed the rest of the evidence yet

5502621 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair browns labour means an unfair britain

5502624 a lot has been printed and said over recent days about the online business activities of the two victims however we must not lose sight of the fact that they are just that victims
5502625 this young couple were killed at the home they shared in newcastle thousands of miles from their families and the country of their birth
5502626 they leave behind distraught families and uncomprehending friends and no amount of speculation concerning their online activities should be allowed to obscure the fact that this was a happy young couple who had their futures snatched away from them

5502629 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5502630 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5502631 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimise sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5502632 these groups already are known to be at higher risk for hypertension and other adverse outcomes

5502634 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation
5502635 becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
5502636 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase

5502645 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5502646 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5502647 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5502648 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5502649 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5502650 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from

5502653 he thompson was a senior administrator for a paedophile website todays sentence reflects how seriously the criminal justice system views those who take gratification from the sexual abuse of children
5502654 id like to make it clear that these websites cannot be stumbled across by their very nature they are hidden and people are directed to them but what i want to re iterate is that people who visit these sites leave a trail and we will follow that trail and find them
5502655 the evidence showed that philip thomson had in his possession one of the largest collections of images of child abuse in the uk
5502656 i provided pre charge advice to cleveland police and decided that philip thompson should not face just one or two specimen charges relating to the images but a total of 27 charges to reflect the criminality of his behaviour and to give the court adequate sentencing powers
5502657 thompson was a critical piece of this jigsaw network he was the librarian warehouseman for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5502658 i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that activity such as this will not be tolerated
5502659 we remain dedicated to finding and prosecuting the person responsible for nilanthans murder irrespective of whether the incident is racially motivated or otherwise
5502660 however should that prove to be the case it only serves to further highlight the tragedy of this young mans murder
5502661 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect
5502662 i would urge local people to read it carefully and think about anyone they know who fits the description given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally
5502663 the taxi driver has not come forward yet and it is vitally important we hear from him

5502671 throwing the rascals out is no longer enough the problem is structural it is inscribed on the maps it glows from the llluminated logos on the contractors office buildings it is built into ths system of governance themselves
5502672 i am for the record horrified at the thought of the nominating conventions
5502673 this is not only because the nation state is seeping mutually day by day but also because the knowledge takes the strength by more and more widely

5502675 many of the hot roles required breadth influence without formal power and knowledge of company culture

5502684 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5502685 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5502686 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5502687 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5502688 hmmm we realize that someone cannot mention everything in one column so that these are selected things that professor clayson has learned i am sorry that he has chosen to publish such negative stuff since there is a lot more to learn
5502689 i would just like to mention that calling those holding an opposing view stupid is nothing new
5502690 mccain is still considered the republican candidate for president while edwards is not
5502691 i have heard over and over again about mccains affair what channel are you watching i think it is one of the only things the democrats have that and showing pics over and over of mccain with bush as if because he took a pic with him he is just like him
5502692 jeroze doyou read anything other than left wing talking points
5502693 the polls are tied yet i cant find anything reporting that bit of info here or on the national sites why
5502694 what does it matter if mccain had an affair its common knowledge that obama had an affair as well
5502695 today prof clayson denounces the press for its religious reverence to obama he then tries to prove it by providing three examples
5502696 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits
5502697 jeroze you are right on mccains affair i did not see the entire saddle back event i was watching the swimming
5502698 cross you kill me every week i cant help but think you read a different article than me each week because your generalizations of claysons intent and meaning behind is writing seams to be much different than what i read
5502699 i dont get it the title says it all now liberals everywhere are trying to say clayson did not learn these things
5502700 cire asks what does it matter if mccain had an affair
5502701 cross is your goal to be insulting to people because if it is you are surely reaching your goals
5502702 sorry cire i wont take you seriously anymore and please dont take what i just wrote seriously
5502703 if you watched that youtube video and thought they were being serious im beyond concerned

5502713 senator mccains proposal is bold its aggressive its an all of the above approach
5502714 senator obama has taken a very minimalist or none of the above or very few of the above approaches
5502715 pawlenty has called for a civil and respectful campaign and yet virtually every time i turn on the television set i see ads that are on the part of mccain that are grossly misleading
5502716 i personally believe that if barack obama gets elected he will slam the door shut on these options
5502717 if senator mccain is elected he will open the door to these options and allow our energy supply to be increased and take some of the pressure off our energy crisis in the country

5502720 hand out 100 000 copies of the brochure is it immoral to vote for obama for president to catholics and evangelicals it has a profoundly jolting effect on readers explained mr terry
5502721 it is mind boggling that millions of catholics are considering voting for obama in spite of the fact that he is the most pro death candidate in history
5502722 worse yet is that they attempt to justify this abandonment of the unborn by citing the common good john paul ii specifically said such reasoning was against the teaching of the church
5502723 this new flyer will clear up any doubt for the open hearted who will be consistent with their faith i hope we can get a lot of volunteers this could really make a difference

5502734 im originally from dayton area near xenia and have eaten at that bk often thanks for the taste of home so to speak every town has its jackass wannabes including xenia still as a mcdonalds shareholder im lovin it what really goes on in the back every day with tainted grocery meats and veggies we cant shop at the store either that only leaves pizza bon appetit
5502735 sometimes i think these political bobble heads just think way too much for their own good personally i have been wondering myself why they havent just raised the sales tax across the board in california and stop the bleeding already its a no brainer quick fix that will hit all people equally in the wallet i have lived here all 38 years of my life and i know how bad it is especially concerning our school budget cuts but instead of the proposal to raise property taxes which would only hit those who own a home an equally fair option is to raise the sales tax rates up a percent across the state its really not rocket science as much as they would like everyone to think
5502736 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5502737 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5502738 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5502739 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5502740 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5502741 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5502742 would not take any move to save the poor market
5502743 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs
5502744 we are starting to see companies going out of business after six to 12 months the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more but its a very slow gradual process
5502745 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5502746 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics
5502747 it seems hard to me to say that we wont see some sort of short term hangover at least
5502748 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5502749 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5502750 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5502751 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5502752 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5502753 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5502754 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5502755 they should hang musharraf upside down for what he has done to the poor of this country
5502756 we are taken to court if we do something wrong why not him god willing things will change for the better now
5502757 these generals have no role in politics their job is to defend the country
5502758 the government says that it cant do its job because of his interference now well see if that is true well see whos stopping who
5502759 and well see if the judges fired by musharraf in november are restored
5502760 thats where musharraf killed 3 000 maybe 4 000 islamic students the way they were butchered is unforgiveable and what did they find in there nothing it was just done to show america that pakistan acts against terrorists to keep the aid money flowing
5502761 this 9 11 happened in america why are we fighting their war before musharraf there was no al qaida here and our borders were secure
5502762 now we have the us on one side in afghanistan and india on the other
5502763 people are selling their children they should jail musharraf for that
5502764 and they are greedy corrupt there has been no change for 60 years so why should we expect it now
5502765 theres no shortage of resources in this country but we go forward a bit and then reverse we never progress
5502766 we believe there is potentially more downside risk to our forecasts as market conditions tighten further during the next 12 months
5502767 in the absence of adecco raising their offer to approximately 500p we can see substantial downside in mpi shares
5502768 we feel it does not make a sensible beach head for a foreign acquirer nor offers much interest to the few uk names that could consider a deal
5502769 we have always said that china is not an export led economy it is driven by domestic demand we think the supply side is going to have a harder time keeping up with demand than people think
5502770 our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions rising input prices skills shortages and the further devaluation of the us dollar
5502771 i think there is a difference between those commodities more leveraged to the emerging economies and those more leveraged to the developed economies
5502772 to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility
5502773 the outlook still looks good even though there may be some impact over the next six months from the weakness in western economies bhp doesnt appear to be too worried because of the ongoing demand coming from chinas industrialisation
5502774 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5502775 today parliament has become sovereign we can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy
5502776 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5502777 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5502778 theres no stable settlement these two guys sharif and zardari will now start slugging it out
5502779 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5502780 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5502781 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5502782 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5502783 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5502784 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5502785 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5502786 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5502787 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5502788 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5502789 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5502790 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
5502791 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
5502792 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
5502793 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
5502794 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5502795 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5502796 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5502797 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress
5502798 theres a very strong bond between mothers and young in all great apes
5502799 there is the same sort of biological role as with humans infants are helpless at birth and need to be looked after in exactly the same way
5502800 it seems to me that its very difficult if youve ever been close to the animals not to think they have emotions like ours but of course its extremely difficult to prove scientifically that they do
5502801 my feeling would be that she would be going through very similar emotions to any mother
5502802 there are reported cases of it taking quite a long time for mothers to realise the infant is actually dead
5502803 you get the dead infant being carried around for a certain amount of time after death
5502804 this perhaps is one of the greatest gifts that a zoo such as ours can bestow to show that animals are very much like ourselves and feel elation and pain gana lost a child but i think in that loss she taught people here so much
5502805 gana doesnt know it but the whole of germany is mourning with her she is so sad right now
5502806 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of the fife council convener of fife council and then member of parliament for central fife and he will be remembered as a true servant of the people a very popular diligent local member of parliament he served fife with great distinction
5502807 his son and daughter spoke lovingly about their father and the influence he had had on them and the role that he played in their lives and how much they would miss him at the same time his public life was reflected in the other contributions that spoke of his passion for this community and the fighter that he had been for burntisland and fife
5502808 i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5502809 quite the opposite they are spreading out to other regions
5502810 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5502811 if they call this a pull out then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5502812 we are aware that the georgian side can undertake provocative actions at any moment against our troops as well as the civilians
5502813 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response we have all the necessary resources political economic and military
5502814 the iasp had always had limited programmes for people in developing countries
5502815 but it became clear to me and others that the developing countries were falling behind the western world
5502816 we started a clinical programme for training people in the actual practical management of pain we now try to ask people to set up the programmes in their own countries for a bottom up application
5502817 bringing people to the west would be costly and teach them things that are not necessarily applicable
5502818 there are gross differences that exist in care as an international organisation we had a responsibility
5502819 pain treatment is a human right and that comes up quite a lot in discussions we should be able to guarantee pain treatment to anyone
5502820 on a professional level this conference will bring as many people as possible together to share ideas get new information and go back home charged up to improve their research and clinical practices
5502821 we want to alert the local population and beyond to the impact of good pain management most people think of cancer and cancer pain as the main area we know more about now than 20 30 years ago it has improved immensely but so has treatment of other pains we still face difficulties and we want the public to know this is a live and active topic
5502822 they could not help him stand up because the injury is in the heel which takes the most force
5502823 he has the strongest will but the pain was intolerable liu would not have withdrawn otherwise
5502824 for the event as a whole it is disappointing the final would have been the climax of the games
5502825 we are not opposed to the americans and i know they have their own fears but any policy devised to deal with these issues should not be perceived as an american issue
5502826 friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5502827 the people of zimbabwe deserve the support of those who claim to uphold the traditions of healing and caring inherent in the medical profession
5502828 we hid in the bushes at the back of our house until 1pm
5502829 i condemn the dastardly attack and the violence sowed by the milf early this morning in some towns of lanao del norte
5502830 we will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5502831 illegal and they were ordered by rebel leaders to vacate the areas they attacked
5502832 but renegade or otherwise it amounts to an affront to our national government even the rebel leadership agrees with us that these renegade groups are breaking the law and we must make every effort to make sure that these things do not succeed
5502833 but if it continues this way i think we will have to seriously take a look at the whole situation are we talking to the correct people
5502834 having a balanced diet is so important for a healthy lifestyle
5502835 if children havent eaten and go to school then their energy levels will be low and it can affect their concentration and learning
5502836 if you eat toast then it should be on wholemeal balanced breakfasts include wholemeal cereal with milk yoghurt and glass of orange juice scrambled eggs on brown bread and baked beans are really good for you
5502837 people should eat a low fat breakfast a couple of pieces of fruit and a bowl of scottish porridge it is a much better start to the day than some sad looking thing that is cold dried up and out of a packet
5502838 people should treat food with more respect in britain we have moved towards this american fast food culture
5502839 we need to get back to some old traditions like eating at specific times a lot of people rush off in the morning and travel long distances to work
5502840 if people travelled less and spent more time in the home then they would create a better home environment and better diets for their children
5502841 eating a sensible balanced diet helps to reduce the risk of heart disease cancer and diabetes
5502842 if you can take out one factor that will stop that person being reassaulted you should have the ability to ban alcohol for those type of people
5502843 the crown are very supportive of this at the moment we may seek for it to be widened out to other offences
5502844 we are always concerned when people try to link alcohol as a causal factor of domestic abuse but theres no doubt in terms of reports to the police alcohol is a trigger point for incidents of violence
5502845 it is an interesting concept but the idea is unworkable and it would be impossible to police
5502846 the concept that men only abuse their partners when they are drunk is nonsense how does that account for all the cases where alcohol is not involved
5502847 domestic abuse is a very complex thing and to focus on alcohol is very unhelpful
5502848 anything that deters an abuser from committing an act of violence or abuse towards an ex spouse has to be welcomed
5502849 but the difficulty i have with this is how do you police it alcohol only stays in the system for a relatively short period
5502850 i would also have concerns as bail conditions only last as long as the case is outstanding as soon as the trial begins the conditions fall
5502851 the alcohol problem may well be long standing and will need long standing solutions a bail order on its own will do little to tackle the problem there also needs to be help to tackle the alcohol addiction
5502852 i can confirm that a proposal from the police is under discussion
5502853 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5502854 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5502855 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5502856 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5502857 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5502858 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5502859 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5502860 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5502861 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5502862 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5502863 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5502864 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5502865 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5502866 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5502867 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
5502868 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
5502869 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
5502870 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5502871 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5502872 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5502873 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5502874 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5502875 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5502876 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5502877 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5502878 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5502879 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5502880 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5502881 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5502882 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5502883 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5502884 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5502885 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5502886 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5502887 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5502888 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5502889 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5502890 gore to lay out unprecedented challenge on energy and climate
5502891 grilling with charcoal the traditionalists choice gives off more health harming carbon monoxide particulate matter and soot than other methods
5502892 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5502893 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5502894 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5502895 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
5502896 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5502897 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5502898 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5502899 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5502900 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5502901 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5502902 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5502903 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5502904 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5502905 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5502906 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5502907 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5502908 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5502909 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5502910 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5502911 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5502912 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5502913 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5502914 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5502915 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5502916 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5502917 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5502918 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5502919 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5502920 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5502921 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5502922 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5502923 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5502924 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5502925 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5502926 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5502927 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5502928 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5502929 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5502930 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5502931 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5502932 but i see that r james woolsey a former director of the c i a serves on the board of american congress for truth your educational foundation
5502933 if you are worried about death threats why would you put a glamorous photograph of yourself on the cover of your new book
5502934 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5502935 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5502936 americans need to get over the political bigotry that there are only two parties
5502937 must be astonishing to canadians who have a multiparty system
5502938 mainstream political parties can essentially cooperate in failing to even attempt to solve problems faced by a majority of citizens usually because they have been funded and supported in other ways by large corporations
5502939 naders presidential campaign as with other similar past campaigns by independents and third parties serve the purpose of educating people about the huge gaps in the mainstream parties platforms
5502940 not stupid theyve developed a highly proficient way of censoring themselves
5502941 until these loopholes are closed you will continue to see regular dishonest unethical secretive unrepresentative and wasteful actions by governments and corporations
5502942 hello americans cut the crap stop making excuses and take over
5502943 protest the corporate control over our political system and to call for opening the presidential debates
5502944 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same boat pulling the same oar the same way
5502945 when you go to the gas pump you dont check whether you are a democrat or republican
5502946 now dependent on foreign nations for 70 percent of its oil the u s is exporting 700 billion annually more than four times the cost of the iraq war
5502947 there are people standing by with billions ready to invest in the future sun wind geothermal biomass
5502948 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5502949 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5502950 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people
5502951 importing 70 percent of our oil now thats an issue of security its going to take us 10 years to reduce our dependency by 30 percent
5502952 efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5502953 to go from a small town like taunton and go to america and do all the research he does especially this as part of the nobel peace prize is a great achievement
5502954 i think what were looking at is a tycoon team if you will people with the resources and vision for a new energy economy
5502955 its time for the wealthiest of the country to lead in solving the carbon crisis
5502956 if they can come together on climate change and pool their intellectual resources their financial resources and their own teams of people they have managing their empires what a critical mass that would be and what a voice it would be
5502957 this is a combination of a symposium and a renewable energy street fair and multimedia presentation
5502958 its a fabulous concentration most venues dont bring all of that together
5502959 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5502960 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5502961 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5502962 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5502963 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5502964 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5502965 he was obviously uncomfortable and we were uncomfortable you cant just develop policy on the spot so not knowing who this person was i had no idea what his standards were and i think we certainly had the discretion to ask him to leave
5502966 im an independent reporter who does original research and has a record of being credentialed
5502967 i dont think theres any question im a member of the media
5502968 sign whatever it is the favored members of the media have to sign swear to whatever they have to swear to
5502969 to some degree these people can be role models in terms of showing our current students that they have a lot of opportunities to advance
5502970 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5502971 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining
5502972 there is a risk with gas but there is a bigger risk having no power

5502977 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5502978 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5502979 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5502980 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

5502989 the result was a provocative account including weavers fret that sen barack obama will best sen john mccain by a landslide if mccains strategy doesnt change
5502990 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
5502991 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5502992 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5502993 man that is born of woman hath a short time to live but oh heavenly father do thou our sins forgive

5502996 i have serious sadness over two things in the congress
5502997 i know its the two biggest issues that youre concerned about but 107 days until the election maybe its 106 by now and things will be better
5502998 this will not happen without the election of barack obama as president of the united states
5502999 i need your help you speak to and influence and connect with so many people
5503000 proposing to get a little increase in oil driiling for fuel to be sold to china 10 to 15 years from now as a solution to our rising gasoline prices makes about as much sense as responding to an attack from afghanistan by invading some other country
5503001 the highest and best thing for me to do is to focus on trying to enlarge the political space in which elected officials address the climate crisis i m devoting my life to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines that supports the truly massive policy change we need to have
5503002 it is true that it would be healthier for us as if we consumed less meat
5503003 i myself am a meat eater and perhaps that has something to do with it
5503004 wearing another hat i have tried to find ways to break down the walls surrounding the television medium and invite people to express themselves on the television medium in a democratized way on current tv
5503005 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5503006 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5503007 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5503008 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5503009 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5503010 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5503011 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5503012 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5503013 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5503014 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5503015 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

5503017 when i first visited lanzarote i found the landscape profoundly disturbing i had never seen colours so dramatically dark and i so fond of brilliant clashing colours was fascinated by the subtle obscurity of the place black had never formed part of my palette
5503018 the authorities here are not doing this because they like films but because they like money we will film their streets their people and export the image of the canaries making films is the best way to make money
5503019 the canaries have suffered a downturn in property prices in keeping with the rest of spain but the presence of almod var in lanzarote has already created a stir in terms of the amount of enquiries we are getting for properties
5503020 this bank has a solid core business but at this stage im not setting out in detail what we need to do to get it back on track im in listening mode and will be until the banks third quarter results at that stage investors will get a clear picture from me on the way forward
5503021 within b amp b there are less secure mortgages especially in self certification and the gmac portfolio i will need to address these issues in coming months
5503022 pym is a safe pair of hands in our view to try to shepherd b amp b through the coming asset quality problems we feel it will suffer however we also feel he can do little to avert said problems
5503023 people thought big food group was dead now look at it woolworths is still a resonant brand with consumers and retailing is about getting the basics right it would be very tough to turn this business around as part of a public company and as part of a larger group it needs time out of the limelight
5503024 how much do woolworths have to give away for someone to take the problem off their hands
5503025 while it is focused on negotiating a recommended offer for michael page adecco is keeping all its options open at this stage

5503031 that the shia doctrine of the imamate was contrary to the quran
5503032 accused the shia of believing that the quran has been corrupted
5503033 consistently associat ing the shia with the extremism of the wahhabi clergy in saudi arabia
5503034 although the iranian shiites are on the opposite side of the religious divide they have one thing in common with the saudis a priestly cast
5503035 roundly condemn the existence of a religious class of scholars as
5503036 at no point were shia religious scholars or academics presented with an opportunity to challenge these points
5503037 it oozes love both for the craft of film making and the subject
5503038 there should be no question in our country of choosing between bear and man
5503039 we must find a balanced means of coexistence on the one hand the presence of bears in the pyrenees reflects a willingness to protect biodiversity on the other the support of the local population is essential
5503040 the animals have been transported to a territory they are not used to
5503041 i think we pakistanis need to be a little more patient with our democrats and a little less patient with our dictators
5503042 the allowances are applicable on approved trips for medical treatment seminars conferences and social gathering
5503043 chevrons investment in people is very significant we currently provide over 7 000 jobs in nigeria with over 2 000 of the employees being direct chevron employees more than 90 percent of them are nigerians
5503044 reporting oil and gas in nigeria critical roles of the media
5503045 communication teams need to be more proactive and come out of the enclave if they are to be effective
5503046 i am happy about the increment the decision is laudable because the reasons they gave for the pay rise is also applicable to civil servants
5503047 the workers are equally affected by economic indices and the need for a living wage to ensure honesty and dignity of the officeholder
5503048 you would be scratching your head why cnooc would make such a decision to quit the project after all the money they spent
5503049 there are many blocks we are working on we move in and out its very normal but i cant comment on any specific block
5503050 being an organisation which primary function is safety regulation nimasa has strict rules and conditions every vessel must satisfy before it can be licenced to operate under cabotage vessels licenced by nimasa can stand their own anywhere if nnpc insists on using on vessels licenced by nimasa there are many of them that will meet all international safety requirements
5503051 if you have seaworthy ships you will lift the kerosene from the high sea for nnpc
5503052 our problem is developmental what support has nnpc given nimasa nnpc is just listening to its foreign partners who demand double hull vessels
5503053 they buy kerosine from us at n40 per litre and put it in diesel this is causing scarcity of kerosine
5503054 the nigerian government asked virgin some years ago to set up a national carrier that nigerians could put their trust in and be proud of virgin agreed to help enable this to happen but made it clear that they would only invest considerable sums in nigeria under certain strict criteria
5503055 one of those was the ability to operate domestic and international flights out of the same terminal which is the only way a flag carrier of any country can operate to my utter dismay certain authorities in nigeria have chosen to ignore our contract sending in heavies a few months ago to smash up our domestic lounge with sledgehammers in an attempt to intimidate the airline
5503056 talk of virgin dumping virgin nigeria is absolute rubbish the intention has always been for the airline ultimately to be wholly owned by nigerian investors it is now time for virgin nigeria to go its own way with local shareholders
5503057 virgin atlantic bought a 49 percent stake in virgin nigeria when it was created four years ago and has since helped the airline to become the safe reliable flag carrier for the region helping to lay good foundations for virgin nigerias continued success
5503058 it is regrettable that events have caused us to review our shareholding and whether it is appropriate that the virgin brand should remain linked to virgin nigeria
5503059 virgin signed a memorandum of understanding in good faith with the nigerian government in 2004 and provided all necessary documentation as required by the government as with every government we work with around the world a deal is a deal and virgin nigeria should be allowed to operate its domestic flights from the international terminal in lagos which offers passengers seamless connections between virgin nigeria services businesses need stability and certainty in order to invest in nigeria
5503060 since it started operations in 2005 virgin nigeria has been run by a local management team based in lagos which virgin atlantic has no control over
5503061 virgin atlantic has had no financial benefit from virgin nigeria in respect of leases rental or facilities during this time in fact virgin nigeria has benefited from highly attractive lease rates offered by virgin atlantic
5503062 while royalty fees are payable for the use of the virgin brand virgin nigeria has not paid anything since its launch
5503063 its a programme we have lined up for execution in the past 10 months to reduce our equity holding and sell same to nigerians it has nothing to do with the statement from the presidency on the relocation to the mma2

5503068 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5503069 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5503070 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5503071 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5503072 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5503073 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5503074 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5503075 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5503076 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5503077 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5503078 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5503079 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5503080 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5503081 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5503082 to us they are not the be all and end all because the viewers have already decided to be with us we have airtime available to make it easy for people to watch arts programming
5503083 it is very pleasing and slightly surreal to be able to announce record half year results when the financial markets are in turmoil
5503084 the end state requirements are not known at programme initiation
5503085 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5503086 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5503087 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5503088 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5503089 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5503090 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5503091 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5503092 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5503093 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5503094 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5503095 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5503096 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5503097 frustrated vendors have been placing their property in the market to let as they have been unable to agree sales due to a lack of demand
5503098 rental expectations fell slightly with some surveyors expecting oversupply to push rents down in the next quarter
5503099 demand for family homes remains stronger than for flats many would be buyers have been forced to rent as the route to mortgage finance has been blocked a total of 43 more chartered surveyors reported a rise than a fall in demand for houses compared to 34 of chartered surveyors who reported a rise in demand for flats
5503100 landlords are in it for the long term rather than to make a quick buck some 13 of landlords own 74 of buy to let properties these are large scale professional investors who provide considerable stability to the market
5503101 on the one hand you have the professional landlord and portfolio property investor who is thriving buying properties at a discount and able to tolerate falling yields in the short to medium term on the other hand you have amateur landlords who are struggling to make ends meet as rents fall and mortgage repayments rise
5503102 i dont read press i dont go on the internet much im just not into it its like the lost art of keeping a secret but it keeps my tunes closer to me and other people
5503103 over the last year the unknown thing become an issue so im not into it any more im a low key person and i just want to make some tunes nothing else
5503104 my names will bevan im from south london im keeping my head down and just going to finish my next album
5503105 the mercurys have become an increasingly important showcase for new artists and esoteric music offerings enabling them to connect with a much wider audience
5503106 historically the lesser known and more leftfield acts tend to show the biggest pickups partly as their album sales start from a relatively low base but also due to the increased profile among mainstream music buyers that the nominations generate
5503107 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5503108 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5503109 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5503110 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something

5503114 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5503115 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5503116 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5503117 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5503118 i am married to the next president of the united states
5503119 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5503120 sweet spot its most comfortable casting distance at about 40 to 50 feet
5503121 we mean no disrespect to our foreign made competitors but abel rods are made for the hitch up your pants and let her rip waters of montana alaska baja mexico the florida keys the bocas of argentina and surf of cape cod
5503122 you have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender
5503123 forensic analysis by computer experts established that the defendant had 241 000 indecent photographs of children being one of the largest seizures of indecent photographs in the uk
5503124 this website while appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles
5503125 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5503126 a number of individuals were detained and questioned as a result of a proactive operation
5503127 consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder the two females arrested and charged last week are still in custody at her majestys prison
5503128 we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody
5503129 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5503130 we are not going to make any further comment at this time and we would ask that the media continues to respect our privacy
5503131 earlier today we informed the families of ben and catherine mullany of the latest developments in antigua the force is continuing its support of the ongoing investigation and trained family liaison officers are continuing to support the families and keep them fully updated on events both in the uk and antigua
5503132 the whole country was in shock from this terrible crime
5503133 these charges will bring some degree of relief to the families of the victims the community and everyone who values life
5503134 we remain dedicated to finding and prosecuting the person responsible for nilanthans murder irrespective of whether the incident is racially motivated or otherwise however should that prove to be the case it only serves to further highlight the tragedy of this young mans murder
5503135 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally the taxi driver has not come forward yet and it is vitally important we hear from him
5503136 words cant express how i feel right now he was energetic always giving a helping hand whenever it was needed every day every second we will be thinking of him
5503137 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5503138 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar non believers with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5503139 the material in their possession promoted extreme ideology most notoriously of osama bin laden of al qaida as well as groups in various countries that adopted it
5503140 these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5503141 it cost me 20 to build the prototype and in the developing world it would be a lot less
5503142 these people have uploaded games and made them available to tens of thousands of people
5503143 what they are trying to do is deter people from illegally filesharing their games this is not a massive revenue generating exercise
5503144 labours taxes and rising cost of living mean that pension increases for poor pensioners will be entirely eaten up by higher inflation
5503145 spend a much higher percentage of their income on high inflation goods like heating light and food
5503146 the truth is that gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made the country less fair browns labour means an unfair britain
5503147 this autumn we are going to step up the pressure to make sure that gordon browns obsession with his own short term survival does not do long term damage to britain that would not be fair
5503148 in 1997 the poorest pensioners lived on 69 a week today pension credit means no pensioner need live on less than 124 a week
5503149 moderately but probably more than im meant to the unit count is sometimes quite challenging i like having a couple of glasses of wine in the evening with dinner most nights ill have a couple of glasses of wine
5503150 during the course of the operation six persons were charged in relation to prostitution offences and one person with a breach of the peace
5503151 her storytelling is timeless and this result confirms that her books are still a firm favourite today what makes blyton so successful is her imaginative exciting and magical style
5503152 scenes more redolent of a bear garden than a meeting of a respected conservative organisation
5503153 if the swinton circle is in self destruct it will be entirely due to you alan harvey
5503154 we have had so many regulations thrown at us because of brussels lack of scientific understanding
5503155 this is the biggest issue that we have had to face for a long time
5503156 they are looking at this through a hazard mechanism rather than a practical mechanism
5503157 its like crossing the road up to now we have been able to cross the road under our own assessment under this hazard method we wouldnt be able to cross the road we would have to build a bridge
5503158 its the ones that are most effective and that are safest that they are going to be taking out
5503159 we will be incurring the same costs but with less yield
5503160 we will end up eating food that has been grown using pesticides that are banned in this country
5503161 you have to do the same worldwide or you are not achieving anything
5503162 this year the standard overall has been very high however there has been a noticeable lack of a brilliant outstanding show
5503163 in the past we had new performers like daniel kitson and demetri martin who were outstanding then last year brendon burns came up with a brilliant show which surprised everyone but this year no one has made the leap into the six stars out of five category
5503164 after several years of fine shows that perpetually threatened to fulfil his considerable potential rhod gilbert has finally surpassed all expectations
5503165 this is exhilarating stand up misguided rage elevated to a sublime degree of storytelling with the wired for coffee welshman taking his audience on a journey unremittingly trivial yet gloriously intense
5503166 a large part of his appeal is his ability to just be his wonderfully eccentric self
5503167 in divide and conga the personal is inextricably intertwined with the political as gordillo
5503168 a wonderfully assured fringe debut that relies heavily on her empathy for the malcontented miserable and ashamedly single
5503169 the if comedy awards are always tough to price up absolutely anyone is in with a chance and we usually wait until the shortlist is announced before drawing up a market
5503170 its difficult to second guess the judges opinions and we see money for all acts very rarely does a clear favourite emerge
5503171 for years i was told i was imagining the pain
5503172 when someone says to a doctor they are in pain whether that is a woman or a child you should start from the position of believing them and listening to them
5503173 that may sound blindingly obvious but in my experience that is not always the case
5503174 and yet there is more and more evidence coming out about this
5503175 but it may be that drugs work differently in men and women
5503176 we need to recognise if a woman isnt responding that she might need something else or a different type of drug and not just say shes a woman and leave her in pain
5503177 we have reported a surge in the number of people enquiring about light boxes used to treat sad
5503178 existing owners are claiming they have been using their products all through the summer
5503179 the recent rainfall in scotland can lead to people not being able to get fresh air and exercise outdoors both of which are proven to reduce feelings of stress and depression
5503180 recent studies have shown that when treating depression the amount of exposure to sunlight correlates to the changes in a persons mood
5503181 we have the utmost respect and admiration for the isaf troops who operate in this challenging environment
5503182 everyone in task force helmand is affected by the death of a soldier and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family
5503183 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5503184 when i got to the scene there was a bus overturned and it looked like it had ploughed into a car and down into a garden
5503185 it is a tragedy in this case that had she been taken to a doctor even 12 to 15 hours after he struck the blow she could have been saved
5503186 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5503187 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5503188 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5503189 are you aware that colds flu most sore throats and bronchitis are caused by viruses did you know that antibiotics do not help fight viruses its true plus taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do more harm than good taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment
5503190 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5503191 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5503192 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5503193 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5503194 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5503195 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5503196 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5503197 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5503198 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5503199 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5503200 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5503201 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5503202 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5503203 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5503204 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5503205 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5503206 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5503207 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5503208 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5503209 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5503210 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5503211 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5503212 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5503213 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5503214 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5503215 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5503216 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5503217 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5503218 a lot of the time people dont consider violence as a public health issue
5503219 but theres a body of evidence that exists now that shows long term health impacts
5503220 the long term consequences of child maltreatment are very real and concerning all children should have safe stable and nurturing environments in which to grow and develop for children and adults to live to their full potential we must support programs that stop child maltreatment before it ever begins and work to help those who have already experienced it
5503221 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5503222 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5503223 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5503224 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5503225 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5503226 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5503227 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5503228 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5503229 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5503230 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5503231 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5503232 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5503233 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5503234 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5503235 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5503236 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5503237 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5503238 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5503239 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5503240 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5503241 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5503242 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5503243 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5503244 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5503245 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5503246 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5503247 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5503248 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5503249 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5503250 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5503251 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5503252 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5503253 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know

5503257 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5503258 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5503259 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5503260 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5503261 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5503262 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5503263 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5503264 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5503265 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5503266 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5503267 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5503268 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5503269 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5503270 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5503271 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5503272 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5503273 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5503274 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5503275 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5503276 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5503277 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5503278 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5503279 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

5503282 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5503283 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5503284 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5503285 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5503286 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing

5503315 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place

5503318 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries

5503340 an end to title ixs gender quota system that has devastated so many of our collegiate sports programs
5503341 in turn this has forced colleges and universities to either cut mens teams or shrink their roster size in order to comply

5503344 the hell in a cell match felt like an instant classic the undertaker and edge waged a physical war these two superstars told an epic story and it certainly ranks near the top of any hiac match i have ever broadcast for me a great match needs a strong storyline and effort and this match definitely had those elements in place not sure when we might see edge again after this conflict but his star is brighter than ever as far as taker is concerned whos been better for the long haul no one in the wwe for my money
5503345 enjoyed seeing matt cappotelli sunday who looked great after battling brain cancer for seemingly the longest time what a great kid who has endured what no one would ever wish on their worst enemy matt has taken tons of chemo and radiation and at this time the tumor looks non existent matt gets a mri every other month to monitor any growth of the tumor i cant put into words how much i admire matts courage and positive frame of mind
5503346 there are two things you do when youre in the majority party in this assembly

5503349 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5503350 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5503351 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5503352 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5503353 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5503354 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention

5503374 we re seeing an increase in consumer awareness of a variety of mobile advertising campaigns from text message to interactive games to mobile internet banner advertisements
5503375 with mobile phone usage growing it s logical for more companies to seek mobile marketing as a way to reach their segmented targets in this direct and highly interactive medium
5503376 these findings indicate the degree to which the mobile phone is used as a marketing channel with enhanced handsets and flat rate data tariffs increasingly common it is only a matter of time before mobile internet advertising starts to rival the penetration of sms or text message marketing
5503377 to come out here took it to another level for me

5503443 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5503444 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5503584 they were all comfortable on the pitch they had good motivation and had a great bond with the fans the team have shown their best side against madrid we have maintained the line that we showed in the friendly against vitesse this is not created either in one day or in six months we are trying to fix a base and be able to carry on in this direction
5503585 what we have seen against real madrid is the identity that we want our team to show to maintain this is not easy but it is the path that we want i have been brought here because my previous teams had a personality we had a good night for valencia
5503586 valencia are coming back to being the team we expect them to be none of us understood what happened to them last year they mostly have the same players i think they are on the right path to improving

5503608 in the 1980s hizbullah was the hub from which suicide tactics spread to the palestinians and other groups
5503609 in the 1990s and beyond al qaida became the hub
5503610 so despite profound theological differences between the salafist jihadist views of al qaida and the shiite hizbullah bin laden sent his operatives to go talk to the hizbullah leadership
5503611 they came back with what were effectively operational blueprints for how to plan and execute suicide attacks especially against hard targets like embassies
5503612 they fatah eventually adopted suicide terrorism in 2000 in the second intifada years after hamas and islamic jihad
5503613 one explanation for their delay is the way prestige was locked up with particular people and within the organization you received credit and priority in the organization based on hijackings kidnappings and remote attacks it made suicide terrorism something very complicated for them to deal with organizationally it took them a long time to figure out how to adopt it

5503616 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5503617 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5503618 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5503619 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5503620 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5503621 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5503622 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5503623 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5503624 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5503625 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5503626 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5503627 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

5503630 well you guys did it so we get to do it
5503631 its the only way they have of making sure this doesnt pass

5503657 durante las olimpiadas hay libertad para testificar de cristo si uno lo hace de forma personal y prudente no organizando reuniones en las esquinas o en una plaza ni tratando de reunir una multitud en estos casos se ponen nerviosas las autoridades pero yo he dicho repetidamente que si una persona lleva nuevos testamentos porciones de la biblia los puede obsequiar a la gente muchos chinos est n estudiando ingl s y si alguien sabe este idioma puede hablar con la gente testificando de jesucristo repartiendo literatura y las autoridades no lo van a frenar

5503661 last school year was when the gas prices started hitting the 4 per gallon mark and yes we have in fact seen more utilization of the school buses and were anticipating throughout the course of this year even seeing the figure going up
5503662 even though theres still a lot of infrastructure here theres still a lot more that has to happen to bring it to fruition and actually have it as a useable and accreditation worthy standards so were gonna make sure that we you know dot every i and cross every t

5503664 anytime you have an elected official who represents a part of your state its important to have that support from them it helps navigate through political issues and also it gives voters an idea that there are other people who can see what you can bring to the table especially in congress in a divided congress at that

5503672 the associated press document provides additional evidence suggesting the obama campaigns insistence that obama was never trained in islam and he never lived as a muslim is not accurate
5503673 moreover the document indicated that obama may have been an indonesian citizen when he lived there
5503674 this is an issue the obama rebuttal fails to address at all evidently conceding the accuracy of the claim
5503675 the obama rebuttal misses the point in claiming my statements about the school registration are a lie
5503676 it is clearly true that the an american expat in southeast asia blog did state the registration listed obama as an indonesian citizen and a muslim that is not a lie
5503677 now that we have the ap photo we see the blog was correct in describing the registration
5503678 the most convincing evidence obama was living in indonesia as a muslim not simply registered as muslim because his father was muslim comes from obamas experience at the government run public school at sdn 1 menteng jakarta not from his time at the catholic assisi school in jakarta
5503679 to put it quite simply mengaji classes are not something that a non practicing or so called moderate muslim family would ever send their child to
5503680 the obama campaign desperately wants to deny obama was raised as a muslim child in the four years he lived in indonesia from age 6 to 10
5503681 what the record clearly shows is not only that obama received islamic instruction at least in the public school he attended
5503682 but he received the type of islamic instruction reserved for muslim children in a government school system that mandated islamic instruction at that time for all children attending public school in indonesia
5503683 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway

5503712 antiguamente trabajaba en colegio era docente despu s de mi diagn stico el gobierno mismo me quita la posibilidad de que yo siga trabajando de lo que pesaba 70 kilos llegu a pesar 28 kilos llegu al hospital mal con m s de 5 enfermedades encima y lo peor del caso es que ya estaba entrando a la tuberculosis
5503713 al principio cuando yo me enter de mi diagn stico dije
5503714 para la regi n nuestra am rica del norte 1 3 millones de adultos y ni os viviendo con vih en el caribe 230 000 y am rica latina 1 6 millones de personas
5503715 a nivel nacional sabemos que la prevalencia del vih anda entre 66 000 a 100 000 casos dentro de estos casos tenemos ya tambi n 18 000 ni os y ni as que han quedado hu rfanos a ra z del vih sida
5503716 la epidemia ha llegado pr cticamente a todos los niveles en grupos ind genas en ni os en universidades pr cticamente podemos decir que bolivia es un pa s infectado por el virus
5503717 es muy grave tenemos un fuerte problema con las estad sticas el gobierno ha tratado de maquillarlas hay un fuerte subregistro a pesar de que tenemos datos que tenemos un problema muy muy fuerte ahorita tenemos problemas de migraci n tanto de m xico a ee uu y de centro am rica a m xico que ha causado que el problema haya ido creciendo
5503718 tenemos aproximadamente a 427 l deres que han sido sensibilizados que est n haciendo de alguna manera un abordaje al interior de sus comunidades al interior tambi n de sus congregaciones esto ha ayudado mucho incluso para que iglesias est n apartando mensualmente de sus ofrendas que reciben para poder realizar actividades y poder apoyar a personas que viven con vih para que se trasladen a los centros de atenci n y reciban sus medicamentos
5503719 entonces la idea es ampliar el universo de facilitadotes nacionales para que cada uno pueda en su pa s tener la certificaci n pero a la vez puedan capacitar para ampliar la informaci n sobre el tema del vih
5503720 its using computers to get a grip on problems that are too complex for the mind to understand unaided
5503721 and i have a much higher awareness of security in everything involved in our elections
5503722 the core of our american democracy is the right to vote implicit in that right is the notion that that vote be private that vote be secure and that vote be counted as it was intended when it was cast by the voter and i think what were encountering is a pivotal moment in our democracy where all of that is being called into question
5503723 no se ha reunido en ninguna ocasi n durante el ejercicio 2007
5503724 we believe that premiers equipment has failed to perform as required by its contracts and according to state law
5503725 we have taken this action to recover taxpayer funds spent for voting systems used in half of the states 88 counties
5503726 many of these vulnerabilities represent practical threats to the integrity of elections as they are conducted in ohio
5503727 we found vulnerabilities in different vendor systems that would for example allow voters and poll workers to place multiple votes to infect the precinct with virus software or to corrupt previously cast votes sometimes irrevocably
5503728 none of the systems out there are even remotely adequate given the importance of the data they handle
5503729 any software you put on your card would uploaded into the systems computer
5503730 there wasnt an attack that we tried that we werent able to carry out
5503731 we learned that every current e voting system has serious exploitable vulnerabilities
5503732 with the election being less than three months away the counties will be using the technology they have
5503733 the elections systems should have the same quality the same reliability the same testing and the same certification requirements as financial systems
5503734 if the systems used by banks which have to report to the sec securities and exchange commission had this level of quality no one would put their money in the bank
5503735 the core of our american democracy is the right to vote implicit in that right is the notion that that vote be private that vote be secure and that vote be counted as it was intended when it was cast by the voter and i think what were encountering is a pivotal moment in our democracy where all of that is being called into question

5503740 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5503741 it didnt take the russian forces long to get into georgia
5503742 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5503743 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5503744 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5503745 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5503746 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5503747 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5503748 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5503749 were starting to come together but were a bit knicked up right now
5503750 but were able to see what some others can do in certain situations and weve had a few bright spots but we have to get better with each practice and work harder every day
5503751 we are delighted to partner with mindleaders the new courses will help people in developing nations get the skills they need to compete in todays knowledge based economy
5503752 being in the learning business is very rewarding nothing brings us greater satisfaction than being able to help developing nations grow their international competitiveness weve trained close to one million people in emerging economies each person weve trained is an individual success story making his or her life better through education thats what drives us at mindleaders
5503753 mindleaders is pleased to be able to provide serebras learners with this comprehensive suite of the most up to date courses in desktop applications it and server network administration
5503754 we believe that these are the very skills that can energize entire workforces in developing regions of the world

5503757 water arouses passions because it can be used as a weapon a political weapon just as oil is a political weapon
5503758 its incomprehensible that in one country there is an excess of water in one place and a deficit in another
5503759 even more incomprehensible is that they expect us to use water from desalination plants which is expensive and would force us to raise prices
5503760 youll never know its so healthy and that makes me giggle to myself
5503761 we will reaffirm the commitment in bucharest and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
5503762 i think the allies are going to be firm that this was a violation of georgias territorial integrity
5503763 we will ask the leadership of the russian federation for there to be a russian military base on the territory of south ossetia because russian citizens live here
5503764 let the americans decide their own american problems and let the people of south ossetia decide their own future
5503765 i am absolutely not interested in the view of america south ossetia will never be part of georgia
5503766 international observers will no longer be present on the territory of south ossetia
5503767 they fled meanly like traitors from south ossetia just before the shooting started we have no confidence in these international observers in these people who corrupt the truth
5503768 i would like to ask you what has happened to the ossetians who after 1992 were refugees on the territory of north ossetia they will be moved there
5503769 georgia has talked a lot about the law on the restoration of property to refugees but no ossetian has been returned to his village today we will restore to them with our own forces what was stolen and taken from them
5503770 we contrary to the georgians have not shot any civilians we built a humanitarian corridor and took them out of there
5503771 we built a corridor and took out all the woman and children
5503772 those who showed resistance who fought against us were exterminated
5503773 i can not give exact figures on the numbers of those who were killed on those who were butchered by the animals who worked for georgian special forces
5503774 there are no instances of looting there have been facts of theft and brigandage
5503775 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5503776 we have all the necessary resources political economic and military if anyone had any illusions about this they have to abandon them
5503777 we do not want a deterioration of international relations we want to be respected we want our people our values to be respected
5503778 we have always been a peace loving state practically there is not a single occasion in the history of the russian or soviet state when we first started military actions
5503779 we have not attacked anyone we only secured the rights and dignity of people as peacekeepers
5503780 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5503781 by getting rid of yield spread premiums on subprime loans we are eliminating one of the root causes of the foreclosure crisis
5503782 this will go a long way in aligning the interest of lenders with the best interest of homeowners
5503783 the federal reserve reported holding us249 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks
5503784 this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit
5503785 we have experienced a lot of changes and they include the changes socially politically and economically with the people and the churches and the ministers need to be on par with these changes all the time
5503786 so it is important to the ministers to upgrade their knowledge theological education and the knowledge of secular context all the time
5503787 the new album will be much more into a melodic direction there will be lots of melodies guitar solos stacked vocal harmonies and high screams it does sound a lot like the stuff what we used to do in the past im sure that old fans will be pleased when they hear it
5503788 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
5503789 i dont know whether were going to be able to get this point through or not do you want to take the risk what about your reputation how do we handle it
5503790 a guest on abcs world news tonight said the following uncontested
5503791 this is almost the equivalent for them of an attack on obamas race by the mccain side its just something you dont do
5503792 we live in a dangerous world we never know whats around the corner
5503793 i thought it was safe because it was a couple of blocks down but then i saw embers
5503794 we have the same kind of roof and we were afraid with all the ash coming in and the wind the whole side of the duplex caught on fire
5503795 i just started grabbing stuff important stuff pictures computer things that cant be replaced
5503796 i thought it was safe because it was a couple of blocks down but then i saw embers
5503797 we have the same kind of roof and we were afraid with all the ash coming in and the wind the whole side of the duplex caught on fire
5503798 i just started grabbing stuff important stuff pictures computer things that cant be replaced
5503799 we have lived here for many years and this is the closest its come to our house
5503800 we havent been put on alert from the fire department
5503801 im in contact with the police to see if we need to do anything i have a window that faces that direction and you cant even really see any smoke its on the other side of the hill
5503802 have not made any moves to be productive and resolve this crisis
5503803 theyre talking about corporations corporations that need to pay the rate they were paying in 1997 because its important for everyone to be accountable and to share responsibilities at this moment
5503804 this budget runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy it is time for democrats to take their heads out of the sand
5503805 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5503806 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5503807 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5503808 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5503809 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5503810 the cow she thinks shes a dog so shes interested in everything
5503811 what would you say if you were flying into memphis and they said you are about to land at isaac hayes international airport
5503812 he is a world person who the world will miss
5503813 literacy civil rights he was always there and thats why were all here for him
5503814 thank god for isaac living 65 years and making a difference in our lives
5503815 hollywood didnt send its stars to us we sent our stars to them
5503816 isaac came from our culture he emanated our culture thats why he never lost his authenticity never lost his conviction
5503817 there would be no isaac hayes without stax and no stax without isaac hayes
5503818 hip hop wouldnt be what it is without isaac hayes
5503819 id like to give a shout out to team owner richie morris who couldnt be here because hes a bit under the weather i hope hes feeling better
5503820 early on we were worried about the tire wear on the front
5503821 we couldnt go the full fuel load on the tires so we had to go with a different pit strategy and run a fast enough pace to make up for the extra stop we were able to maintain a fast enough pace
5503822 we had the bike set up to run consistently through a whole stint
5503823 but i got a big leg cramp nine laps before the end of my stint and i was trying to work it out i wanted to make sure we got through the stint so we could stay on our three stop strategy but we lost about two seconds a lap there
5503824 weve been working working working and finally we managed to finish up here ive got to thank steve decamp and the whole team for all their hard work
5503825 i had heard they didnt have much crew and we made a point of changing tires on our second stop
5503826 i could see him filice sliding around and i knew i would be able to get around him
5503827 they the no 66 team gapped us a bit in the second stint
5503828 but then they went off the track and we were able to bring it home the bike was awesome the whole time at the end the tires were sketchy but we had fun
5503829 stiffened and unsepulchered bodies weltering in blood their rigid countenances pallid and distorted with agony
5503830 pupils personal development including their spiritual moral social and cultural development is outstanding
5503831 not really we are jubilant its a triumph a fantastic day for summerhill the government has persistently refused to acknowledge the individual philosophy of the school such as that children can learn just as well out of the classroom we feel vindicated
5503832 it was tense before this latest inspection all the same though
5503833 we all have a say in how the school is run its like another family that takes care of you
5503834 you can do whatever you like as long as you are not affecting anyone else
5503835 the democratic process used to manage the running of the school provides pupils with outstanding opportunities for personal development
5503836 there is a growing movement towards child participatory types of education their words pave the way for others to copy our model its a recognition that it works on the other hand just as you think education is getting more humanised a government minister will say its all about performance performance performance ill always view them with deep suspicion
5503837 summerhill was an environment so isolated from the outside world that at times it was almost a childish illusion
5503838 everyone seemed to trust and respect each other there was nothing i had to do there was never a moment when i felt alone so i was able to be alone without being lonely nothing was there to prevent me from dealing with and sharing emotions of anger sadness or happiness
5503839 the democratic education we had made me aware of the need to behave responsibly and to problem solve tactfully
5503840 summerhill has prepared me well for a career in stage design i need to reflect emotionally on the storylines and to communicate well
5503841 ill never forget the schools dispute with the government i arrived in 1999 in the middle of it when summerhill was threatened with closure i could feel a huge anxiety coming from every corner of the school
5503842 i remember going back to my room at bedtime and sitting with my roommates sophie hester and natali we sat in a circle and cried we didnt want summerhill to close down who wants their home to be taken away
5503843 its terrific news that one of the premier motorsports events in the world is coming back to utah that will not only showcase our state to a nationally televised audience but will also provide an estimated 9 million in economic impact to utahs economy as well
5503844 having monster energy supercross back at rice eccles stadium is another major accomplishment for us as we continue to establish utah as one of the top action and extreme sport destinations in the world
5503845 i have some suspicions and know more than i did when i got the phone call on december 7 2006 but still would like something concrete what the real reason was we know it wasnt anything to do with our performance wed like some closure to find out what the reasons were
5503846 you try to put it behind you but it was so devastating personally and professionally and there are constant reminders
5503847 i have to see a show there one of these years
5503848 cme quiere mucho esto debido a que el mercado de futuros es uno de los pocos monopolios que quedan en el mundo y este es un monopolio debido a que tienen sus propias operaciones de liquidaci n
5503849 the investigation is continuing cid is identifying additional suspects and theyre not going to complete the investigation until theyre confident that everybody that was involved in the murder been identified and warrant have been issued for their arrests
5503850 we dont have any specific plans well try and see if we can find opportunities here maybe make another contribution to the community
5503851 ive had some conversations with folks involved in the search and am certainly willing to talk about it if that makes sense for the chamber and myself and the community
5503852 the renovation of the seawall the construction of the american bank center arena the renovation of the existing american bank center and convention center and the construction of whataburger field are all highly visable new things in the community that are exciting to be a part of
5503853 you always think if you had it to do over again would you do things differently for me absolutely
5503854 there are a lot of things where i could have done things a little differently in the end hindsight is always 20 20
5503855 i think that presidents deserve to be questioned perhaps irreverently to bring them down a size
5503856 i knew a kid was down and to realize who the player was was unbelievable it was a scary situation
5503857 were not worried about playing football right now or anything like that but were talking about ok for the rest of his life
5503858 we work very closely with the military particularly along the border region and we would hope and expect that that would continue
5503859 resolving the whither musharraf question may well allow the government in pakistan to now focus on issues of even greater urgency and immediacy like what is happening in the tribal areas
5503860 the new pakistani government may or may not prove to be as reliable of an ally in the has been only time will tell
5503861 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person
5503862 whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists and prevent them from in afghanistan and carrying out attacks and from attacking targets within pakistan
5503863 just have them thinking beyond high school what they want to do with their lives just present a positive alternative to being in a gang or doing any other negative things
5503864 you know a lot of kids get a bad wrap for being bad or mischievous when really they just need a positive role model in their life
5503865 we brief our guys on what to expect so if it gets really bad they know how to react to it if it doesnt get really bad than its an easier day for us
5503866 its very difficult to learn to use an interpreter so its good practice for myself and my lieutenants
5503867 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5503868 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5503869 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5503870 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5503871 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5503872 you dont pass that sort of legislation unless theres some sort of intent to use it
5503873 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5503874 this is really a young man who has fallen into that stereotype of a rather sad and lonely teenager who spends too much time in a darkened room in front of a computer screen
5503875 he has not had much life experience to get himself mature
5503876 american idle disparaged by some teammates for his lack of durability carl pavano could return to the yankees this weekend
5503877 if people have that type of attitude there its stupid cashman said monday
5503878 everybody has issues and makes mistakes or has things to deal with its about turning the page and moving forward and concentrating on whats in front of you rather than concentrating on whats behind you
5503879 hes had no setbacks in his rehab at all cashman said
5503880 hes close to being ready for us which is great
5503881 perhaps he is devoting the time not spent discussing the issues to studying them
5503882 oh no boo hoo hoo because then they might arrest buddy
5503883 includes myself jeff croft rob jones dan rubin jina bolton nathan smith james craig garrett dimon keith robinson chris heilmann jason beaird ethan marcotte john moore brian oberkirch todd dominey ben chestnut rob weychert and many more
5503884 i told mr emile that mr neeraj is acting very
5503885 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
5503886 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
5503887 id call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation hes taking and get him to work
5503888 it reminds me of the old story of two guys in the chow line at prison
5503889 one guy turns to the other and says the food was a lot better when you were governor
5503890 much talking is the cause of danger silence is the means of avoiding misfortune the talkative parrot is shut up in a cage other birds without speech fly freely about
5503891 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5503892 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5503893 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5503894 one of the key questions surrounding the governments escalating use of military contractors is actually not whether they save the government client money or not rather the crucial question that should be asked at the onset of any potential outsourcing is simple should the task be done by a private company in the first place
5503895 we calculated about 135 times hed been interrogated and about the first 120 the only interest they had was al jazeera
5503896 they told him that they thought al jazeera was an al qaeda front
5503897 they were trying to get him to finger a number of well known al jazeera journalists as being in the muslim brotherhood
5503898 they wanted me to betray the principles of my job and to turn me into a spy
5503899 if we were going to try to silence al jazeera it would be at a higher level of personnel than some cameraman trainee
5503900 was trained by al jazeera in the use of cameras
5503901 as a vehicle to show the world that human rights abuses still occur all over the globe
5503902 i think its pretty disingenuous of the government to come out and say
5503903 so far the stats look like 100 say no to id cards time to lose these results in a train station
5503904 george orwell never intended 1984 to be a manual for society youre a smart woman im sure you knew that but i thought you ought to be reminded
5503905 thought id reupload this piece of propaganda on behalf of jacqui smith but with the option to post comments and rate on you know seeing as the videos meant to be promoting discussion and everything
5503906 we would also be concerned for the safety of students personal information if they were forced to enter the id card system
5503907 we will issue identity cards on a voluntary basis to young people from 2010 and there are no plans to make it necessary to hold an identity card to access any services
5503908 young people who do not have an id card will still be able to get student loans and indeed no other public services will be denied just on the basis of whether they have an id card
5503909 we want to know what people in this age group think of the national identity scheme and their reactions to what services could be included with it
5503910 the website will run for 12 weeks until mid october and the feedback we get will be assessed and the findings will help us shape how we roll out the voluntary enrolment system for id cards
5503911 if they get a large negative reply the government will say that online figures do not necessarily represent the greater populations opinion if they get a large positive reply the conclusion will be we have received positive feedback from the population thats politics for ya
5503912 no charge sheet can stand against me not even a single charge can be proven against me as i have full trust in allah almighty and i did everything with the belief of pakistan first
5503913 this is not time for individual bravado whether i lose or win in impeachment proceedings the pakistani nation will be the loser
5503914 its a victory for all democratic forces and its victory for benazir bhutto and all those who sacrificed their lives for democracy
5503915 i saw pictures of the board game in papers and was absolutely baffled
5503916 surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
5503917 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
5503918 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
5503919 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
5503920 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody
5503921 the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the u s once prosecuted as war crimes
5503922 harm lasting months or even years after the acts were inflicted upon the prisoners
5503923 while the documents released today do provide more information about the development and implementation of the bush administrations torture policies even a cursory glance at the documents shows that the administration continues to use national security as a shield to protect government officials from embarrassment criticism and possible criminal prosecution
5503924 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue
5503925 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled

5503930 when we originally came up with the concept of doing the game the whole idea of continuing content was pretty amorphous how that was going to happen who pays for that we all kind of assumed that would come out of the revenue the subscription money we did get we all poured directly into keeping the game online keeping it up and running but the development demands far outstripped the revenues there just wasnt a good contemplation early on of how that would work
5503931 some of them were just bad timing in the pc market the pc market was lousy last year some of it was the fact that we were an independent studio we didnt have unlimited money and we had to ship when we had to ship part of it was because we overreached and that was a design problem that was totally our fault we tried to do too much we tried to be a standalone game and a free play game and an mmo and an rpg and a shooter we were trying to be something for everybody and ended up really not pleasing many people at all
5503932 i think thats a thing that the general world never sees
5503933 these guys make games they have this business they did it it didnt work out they move on
5503934 oh wow these guys are starting their own company theyre gonna sell it theyre multibillionaires
5503935 national average uk rent fell from 950 per month in june to 900 in july
5503936 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5503937 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5503938 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5503939 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5503940 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5503941 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5503942 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5503943 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5503944 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians

5503972 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5503973 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5503974 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5503975 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5503976 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5503983 postoperative ileus remains the single greatest barrier to hospital discharge in otherwise uncomplicated colorectal surgery
5503984 if this relatively easy safe and cheap intervention can help it is certainly something worth trying
5503985 we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of hospital stay
5503986 this doesnt mean that if you give someone chewing gum they will just jump out of bed and feel good enough to go home
5503987 the advantage of ercs is that they can be used in an off the shelf manner meaning they can be delivered to the point of care do not require matching and are easily injectable without the need for complex equipment
5503988 we are proud of assembling such a strong clinically experienced team to contribute to these studies
5503989 dr ewa carrier and suman kambhampati are hematologists who use stem cells on a regular basis dr angle is a vascular surgeon who like dr murphy sees cli on a daily basis and dr amit patel has performed numerous cardiac stem cell clinical trials with such a team that understands not only the science but also the practical implementation we feel we are well positioned to translate this discovery into a practical therapy in the near future

5504009 there are several industries we have looked at but these are all industries that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries timor can gain skills from
5504010 what weve proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and were also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5504011 timor would benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble these people certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5504012 i also think that given australias close relationship with east timor at the moment we have a moral responsibility to develop a workforce
5504013 we are now looking at other skilled areas that would assist timor in gaining skills so were not just talking about employment were also looking at a dual program of both employment and skilling to help timor with its own strategic industries that will help its recovery and development

5504041 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5504042 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5504043 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5504044 the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
5504045 see them better than they are and they shall become such
5504046 let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men and to the household of faith and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of god and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distill upon they soul as the dews from heaven the holy ghost shall be thy constant companion
5504047 the ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name the pure in heart and the wise and the noble and the virtuous shall seek counsel and authority and blessings constantly from under thy hand thy people shall never be turned against thee although their traitors testimony shall cast thee into trouble because of thy righteousness they god shall stand by thee forever and ever if thou art called to pass through tribulation all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good hold on thy way and the priesthood shall remain with thee for their bounds are set they cannot pass thy days are known and thy years shall not be numbered less fear not what man can do for god shall be with you forever and ever
5504048 it is an imperative duty that we owe to god to angels with whom we shall be brought to stand and also to ourselves to our wives and children to the widows and fatherless whose husbands and fathers have been murdered to all the rising generation and to all the pure in heart who are kept from the truth only because they know not where to find it therefore that we should waste and wear out our lives in bring to light all the hidden things of darkness wherein we know them and they are truly manifest from heaven these should be attended to with great earnestness let us cheerfully do all that lie in our power and then may we stand still with the utmost assurance to see the salvation of god and for his arm to be revealed

5504051 when you wake up with a sense of loss a sadness that knots in your stomach its a feeling you cant get rid of its a broken heart that has to heal over time and every time you wake up every time you turn a new corner there is a reminder of the loss the sadness and the hurt and thats ok i have this image in my mind of josh lying in his hospital bed the nurses and doctors taking him off of life support and his family standing around unsure of how to experience this loss i picture the days daniel sat by his side holding his hand and talking to him holding on the hope of miracles and a new life with his only brother and i picture a family experiencing the loss of one of their own every holiday every birthday every wedding every birth of a child into family always wishing that josh could be there and that wish is ok the sadness and anger and sense of failure are all parts of the grieving process that has to be worked through

5504129 sometimes i only have to think about something funny to collapse and sometimes it happens again just as im coming round because i think about the joke that made me fall over in the first place
5504130 once i tried to calculate how often it happened in one day but i lost count at 40
5504131 it first happened one day shortly after i went to university i was sitting in my kitchen my flatmate made me laugh and i hit the floor i could hear and see everything going on but i couldnt move a muscle
5504132 i had one patient who it happened to whenever he felt smug
5504133 im always laughing sometimes my mum and i dont even have to be talking about something funny to laugh
5504134 its always at the forefront of your mind because you constantly have to assess an area for danger is there glass around any sharp corners even having a cup of tea in your hand can be dangerous
5504135 i had to stop cycling and driving at one time i thought i might not be able to have a family because what kind of a mother would i be collapsing all the time then theres the embarrassment factor all of a sudden you can fall into your dinner or your drink starts pouring straight out of your mouth

5504141 its almost certainly under recognised and it usually tends to get picked up first by the patient themselves rather than a doctor i see so many people who have been dismissed time and time again it can be a disabling condition one study found that its effects can be at least as great as epilepsy some people try to keep their emotions at bay which can affect relationships and the ability to socialise for example and others find it difficult to get a job

5504207 can the country face more confrontation can the countrys economy face more destruction
5504208 the honor and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honor of the office of president will also be affected
5504209 we are facing calamity everything is expensive behind the government is his hand
5504210 when he goes there will be a new government and prices will go down
5504211 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world for this he has our deep gratitude
5504212 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5504213 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests leveled false allegations against me and deceived people
5504214 not a big charismatic figure or a future player in pakistani politics
5504215 instead of one principal player you now have four or five
5504216 youll have zardari sharif the isi pakistans secret service the army the judiciary the multifaceted political dynamics in pakistan will be more complex than it has been
5504217 while not necessarily a substitute for musharraf he is a person the united states is working with
5504218 i told her that this war the way you are fighting here is not in anyones interest and we have to look into pakistans interests and we dont want our army to fight against the pakistani state
5504219 before 1999 where was pakistan pakistan had no international identity nobody knew pakistan we gave pakistan a status
5504220 and when we go abroad there is some weight in our words we put pakistan on the map gave it importance gave it status which by the grace of god is still there

5504226 how should i feel about the russians they killed my brother
5504227 the bombs killed him and i have no food to feed his children i need some help
5504228 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5504229 in the telephone conversation between the russian president and french president nicolas sarkozy they only spoke of a pullback and i hope this subtlety is well perceived were not talking about a withdrawal
5504230 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5504231 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5504232 we have no confidence in these international observers in these people who corrupt the truth
5504233 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5504234 our strategy begins with stationing our officers overseas and we have over 200 customs and border protection officers around the world in 58 of the largest seaports
5504235 its a huge challenge to figure out how we going to manage this risk
5504236 and given the scale of the vulnerability and the consequences of a terrorist event particularly targeted at our ports or cargo coming to our ports we are just not there yet

5504244 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5504245 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5504246 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5504247 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5504248 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5504249 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5504250 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5504251 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5504252 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5504253 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5504254 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5504255 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5504256 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5504257 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5504258 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5504259 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5504260 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5504261 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5504262 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5504263 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5504264 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5504265 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5504266 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
5504267 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
5504268 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
5504269 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
5504270 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
5504271 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
5504272 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
5504273 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
5504274 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
5504275 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
5504276 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
5504277 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

5504294 standard advertising values of traditional print posters in the mall environment
5504295 the launch of our iconic pods is a fundamental sea change in the development of mall advertising in the uk
5504296 bias towards aging affects the medical treatment seniors receive in many cultures in the world elderly people are revered and their advice is sought and respected in our culture the wisdom the knowledge and the social skills of the elderly are often overlooked and instead we focus on the mental and physical deficits of our older generation
5504297 it is inevitable that many medical care providers will unconsciously have this same attitude towards their older patients
5504298 a 90 year old man meets with his doctor and complains about pain in his right knee
5504299 many in the health care profession consider old age to be a disease itself any medical problems are inappropriately attributed to old age as if it were a medical condition and since there is no cure for old age appropriate tests and treatment are never performed
5504300 s he should expect to be tired as surgery can have a major effect on the elderly
5504301 geriatric oriented practitioners require caregivers to closely monitor health conditions in their loved ones and report any changes before things get worse these providers also meet with the patients regularly enough to monitor on their own their patients current health
5504302 this broad based approach results in better health more functionality and fewer visits to the emergency room because intervention for a worsening condition is achieved at an earlier stage
5504303 shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5504304 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5504305 we call some things mental illness because it gives some people an excuse for poor behaviour and personal failings
5504306 i wish i could say i was knocked off my feet i wish i could say this came as a huge surprise and disappointment
5504307 the reality is in 21st century canada that it doesnt
5504308 if somebody said to you they had a pain in their stomach you wouldnt assume it was fake you would assume they had a problem and had to get it looked at
5504309 people arent willing to recognize that mental illness is a genuine illness
5504310 an almost religious judgment of people involved with alcohol or drugs as sinners
5504311 there are all kinds reasons why people fall prey to these problems
5504312 the other teams didnt want to play with him anymore for fear that if they had a cut they would get infected
5504313 accounts for a very small minority of all of violence in our society
5504314 as visible as the person on the street corner who is sleeping on a grate and hallucinating is in the downtown core of any city there is also an invisible army of people walking to work in the office towers around that grate who themselves have also experienced some form of mental illness and substance abuse who have recovered who are back in the workforce who are back with their families
5504315 but the message is very clear from this survey theyre not going to talk about it theyre not going to disclose and theyre not going to disclose as long as there is a culture of shame secrecy and stigma
5504316 what we tried to do was raise awareness with staff and assessed how we would handle future cases of suicide
5504317 we also discussed how teachers and staff could recognize signs of depression and suicide hopefully we will never have to experience an ordeal like this again but if it happens i think we will do the right thing and try to move forward
5504318 a lot of times family members have a hard time coming to terms and often slip into a state of denial
5504319 so we really have to make sure all our bases are covered and determine with certainty that suicide is in fact what happened
5504320 when officers arrive on the scene the first thing we do is clear and mark off the area then we try to search for a suicide letter or any other clue that would confirm suicide and start to slowly piece together the puzzle
5504321 my problem is that when i was younger i used to get called that quite a bit and i started believing it
5504322 the long count will invite the company and our audiences to leap into the myriad possibilities revealed in the future we cant foresee
5504323 didnt our pal dg just get an imac and has an ipod touch he wants to give away
5504324 must be preceded by a passive affirmative nonchallenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future
5504325 ethical standards must be elastic to stretch with the times
5504326 all values are relative in a world of political relativity
5504327 ethical standards must be elastic to stretch with the times all values are relative in a world of political relativity
5504328 it is the madness of folly to expect mercy from those who have refused to do justice and even mercy where conquest is the object is only a trick of war the cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf
5504329 our long term goal is not to have an adversarial relationship with russia but it cannot be business as usual
5504330 we have to take a look at all the elements of the relationship and this of course would include high level meetings
5504331 we dont want to hear that mikheil saakashvili is a saint
5504332 we hope it will be a balanced and responsible decision and that the us will not break all the glassware in our house
5504333 i think youll see a nato more united than you might expect
5504334 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5504335 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5504336 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5504337 hes mikey ok hes like the locusts hes not gonna be right again for like seven years
5504338 i mean cmon we all know that mike is an idiot didnt we find out he had dyslexia at one point

5504387 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5504388 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance

5504390 certainly now what we want to see in pakistan is a period of political stability to enable the government and the parliament of pakistan to address the serious issues that pakistan faces including security issues because they have very direct consequences for the nearly thousand troops that we have in afghanistan abutting the afghanistan pakistan border

5504402 when uk forces fired rockets at taliban fighters unaware that civilians were in the vicinity of enemy fighters in a local compound
5504403 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5504404 while it is unclear exactly what caused their death an investigation is underway
5504405 between 250 and 500 kilometres 150 and 300 miles above the earth
5504406 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5504407 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5504408 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future
5504409 i find the ethical considerations of supervised injections to be profoundly disturbing
5504410 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5504411 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5504412 its clear that this was being used as a political issue

5504419 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5504420 will senator mccain keep the money reed has raised for him and is reed is a member of the mccain victory 2008 team if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5504421 you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you kiss your first prince
5504422 i want the client not to have to navigate citigroup i want us to navigate citigroup and bring it together at the front end for them

5504425 if anything the largely invisible practices of ad networks raise even greater privacy concerns than do the behavioral advertising techniques that isps could employ such as deep packet inspection

5504429 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5504430 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5504431 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5504432 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5504433 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5504434 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5504435 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5504436 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5504437 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5504438 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5504439 their immediate reaction could be to cut back or even omit applications to keep fertiliser purchase costs within budget
5504440 but this year especially the requirements of each field or crop block must be reviewed to determine which policy to follow to continue as usual rely on soil reserves more or in a few very poor areas to increase the amount of p and k applied
5504441 the analysis costs will be recouped many fold and without up to date analysis wrong decisions could easily be made
5504442 where a field may have two or more soil types sample each area separately
5504443 note the stone content because significant quantities will dilute the amount of available nutrients
5504444 we assume that a soil with an index of 2 for both phosphate and potash is satisfactory and for many growers this is true but poorly structured soil reduces root growth and access to nutrients so on thin soils especially where there is a high stone content indices above 2 are needed
5504445 economies can be made in these cases but beware of doing so in fields with a poor soil structure
5504446 freshly applied water soluble phosphate is available to crops for about six weeks before it starts to be absorbed by the soil however in more shallow soils even at index 1 there are unlikely to be sufficient nutrients available for optimum uptake and yield potential
5504447 soils with indices of 0 are very unlikely to provide enough so all the crops requirements should be provided by some form of fertiliser at the very least replacing the phosphate and potash removed in the previous crop
5504448 a 9t ha crop of wheat with no straw taken off will remove 70kg ha and 50kg ha of phosphate and potash respectively
5504449 the iasp had always had limited programmes for people in developing countries
5504450 but it became clear to me and others that the developing countries were falling behind the western world
5504451 we started a clinical programme for training people in the actual practical management of pain we now try to ask people to set up the programmes in their own countries for a bottom up application
5504452 bringing people to the west would be costly and teach them things that are not necessarily applicable
5504453 there are gross differences that exist in care as an international organisation we had a responsibility
5504454 pain treatment is a human right and that comes up quite a lot in discussions we should be able to guarantee pain treatment to anyone
5504455 on a professional level this conference will bring as many people as possible together to share ideas get new information and go back home charged up to improve their research and clinical practices
5504456 we want to alert the local population and beyond to the impact of good pain management most people think of cancer and cancer pain as the main area we know more about now than 20 30 years ago it has improved immensely but so has treatment of other pains we still face difficulties and we want the public to know this is a live and active topic
5504457 warrens different from dobson in that youre not going to hear him saying all this bitter nasty stuff about secularists or the pro choice movement
5504458 warren is now putting forward a new image and a new style but not new ideas or really new politics
5504459 hes doing it at a time when it makes a lot of sense for an ambitious preacher with aspirations to power to stop putting all his eggs in the republican basket
5504460 warren is a pioneer of seeker sensitive evangelicalism aka consumer tested christianity saddleback is designed to seem like what its attendees want it to be
5504461 its more mild mannered than the mean old fundamentalism of the late jerry falwell more life style oriented a theology specially made for its orange county congregation every bit as conservative as old jerrys faith but much more suburban much more middle class
5504462 t he hard core religious right the dobsonites hagee and parsley and robertsons folks are somewhere between 8 10 of the electorate nobody expects them to ever do anything other than vote for republicans theres another group perhaps another 10 15 of the electorate who are more of a swing vote even if they do share some or all of the political stances of the religious right
5504463 breach of these provisions in the pensions act is a criminal offence it is for this reason that we take such a serious view of your story
5504464 we are now considering whether there has been any potential breach of the restricted information provisions and what if any action to take
5504465 we would with respect suggest that it is clear section 82 of the pensions act was not intended to be used by the pensions regulator to prevent or punish the reporting of actions taken by the regulator or to allow in effect such actions to be taken in secret
5504466 it is disgraceful that the pensions regulators press office should have rung up our journalist and threatened her with prison
5504467 such behaviour is at best unbecoming of a regulatory body
5504468 the right of journalists to protect their sources is vital if the media is to be able to do its job properly and that includes ensuring regulatory bodies are exposed to proper public scrutiny
5504469 we take an open and transparent approach but in certain instances information is protected in law to protect the confidentiality of those who we regulate and avoid jeopardising investigations
5504470 we made it clear to the magazine prior to its publication that the information they had obtained related to an ongoing investigation and we considered it to be restricted after publication we wrote to the editor requesting further information and sought to prevent further breaches
5504471 private investors have accumulated significant amounts of equity in buy to let properties after a long period of strong growth in home and flat values higher mortgage rates and falling property prices will cause investors to reconsider their exposure to residential property and many will choose a more diversified approach with inflation rising investors realise the need for strategies that preserve their wealth
5504472 never have so many people in germany ridden trains as in the first six months of this year nor so much freight transported on the rails
5504473 in todays compensation culture it is unfortunately all too easy to imagine a customer suing their dog psychologist if their dog continues to eat their slippers or somebody taking their feng shui consultant to court if theyre not happy with their homes energies
5504474 ive not had to borrow any money from the bank or go to other investors the companys success is 100pc mine
5504475 the fundamental thing is that china consumes five units of metal for each unit of gdp compared with one unit per unit of gdp in the west because it is at a different stage of development
5504476 china is not an export led economy it is one that is driven by domestic demand we will see some moderation but we are quite confident in the long term prospects
5504477 while there are enough resources to satisfy the worlds appetite the industry has not moved quickly enough to meet the growth in demand
5504478 we have grown the company and the value of our scrip shares every year
5504479 i think on balance i would say that the value of our scrip compared with rios has gone up in value not the reverse
5504480 we are not price setters we are price takers we would have an incentive to boost supply not withhold it
5504481 busy and focused on the main event weve said the current opportunity we are working on is by far the most valuable transaction we can do in the industry
5504482 we like platinum but we dont want to be in mines where you structurally are expected to have fatalities
5504483 i have been a little surprised that we have not yet seen more consolidation in the western oil companies
5504484 i see more consolidation over the next few years scale is very important when you have to produce things cheaply and produce a lot of it
5504485 whichever way the court rules its decision will have a major impact across the civil service
5504486 obstructing rafts of people who are dying to get out of the department with a wad of cash
5504487 prospect is not in the business of allowing jobs to be sold at a discount we are here to protect employment and to stop the destruction of the mods specialist skills base
5504488 the album has been finished for a while now i dont really know whats going on with it
5504489 the record industry is a very political place at the moment and i am on emi records lots of people have been fired or have taken redundancy recently as the company was taken over by a private equity firm called terra firma
5504490 many of these people were people assigned to my projects and now i dont quite know whats going on
5504491 im sure everyone will find their feet soon enough and ill be able to put the album out soon
5504492 this will damage germanys economic standing the controls should be restricted to questions of national security in the face of such regulations any financier is going to think twice about whether he should be investing here at all
5504493 the new rules are very modest and only allow government interference in foreign investment projects in very few cases
5504494 in germanys place i wouldnt sell anything to a russian or a chinese state fund
5504495 im sure everyone will find their feet soon enough and ill be able to put the album out soon
5504496 when youre driving down the motorway all the steel products you can see are made by us or could be made by us
5504497 we are doing particularly well out of the highways agencys road widening schemes
5504498 our temporary crash barriers protect workers while the motorway is widened and then our fixed barriers go in place when the works are finished
5504499 in birmingham our signs saying that drivers can use the hard shoulder are needed every 600m
5504500 a lot of our sales increase is through that acquisition
5504501 but we are also using zinkinvent to roll out our products in other countries
5504502 the uk is a small island there are only so many miles of crash barrier to build
5504503 but even a small share of the world temporary barrier market would be huge
5504504 pretty impressive performance is down to decent management and good organic growth
5504505 hes hunted hes wanted this is not what i would call living the good life
5504506 the purpose of doing this is unsurprisingly to help our clients plus increasingly the money is not just in the hands of europeans increasingly you need access to the gulf
5504507 the best bank by a mile in the region is efg hermes and i had the serendipity to meet them
5504508 considerable opportunity for the group to build a sustainable value retail proposition based primarily on its small to medium stores
5504509 inflation or more precisely peoples perception that prices are rising much faster is likely to cast its shadow over economies and markets for some time
5504510 yet uk equity investors can not only protect themselves from higher prices but also seek to profit from them
5504511 where everything had to be said swiftly with one breath
5504512 if only i could get rid of this dead weight so that i could use all my strength to struggle for my own survival
5504513 and there was evening and there was morning one day
5504514 i wanted to show the end the finality of the event
5504515 man raises himself toward god by the questions he asks him
5504516 every question possess es a power that does not lie in the answer
5504517 the last transport left the station on a sunday morning
5504518 it was from that moment that i began to hate them and my hate is still the only link between us today
5504519 i do not know whether it has ever happened before in the long history of the jews that people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves
5504520 the student of the talmud the child that i was had been consumed in the flames
5504521 w e were no longer afraid of death at any rate not of that death
5504522 always near each other for suffering for blows for the ration of bread for prayer
5504523 another wound to the heart another hate another reason for living lost
5504524 so heavy was my anguish that i made a vow not to speak not to touch upon the essential for at least ten years
5504525 we can only hope that the little whale has found its mum or has found a female that can look after it and there will be a happy ending

5504532 17 out of 20 financial stocks in the s amp p 500 index have cut dividends this year
5504533 dividends are usually the last thing to go you might as well put a big sign on your lawn saying you have liquidity problems
5504534 millions of decent taxpayers will foot the bill for institutional idiocy
5504535 from what we see and what we project we see no reason to cut the dividend
5504536 no less than the international perception of the credit quality of the u s government is at stake
5504537 their importance fnm and fre lies in what their rescue says about the financial system at fannie and freddie and shockingly at the investment banks the profits were privatized but the risks were socialized
5504538 the global economy is at the point of maximum danger
5504539 theres probably three or four guys in the world that can beat him and id like to say im one of those guys
5504540 the pressure is on him everyone is looking at him im just going to focus on myself whether thats good enough for gold silver or bronze i dont know but at the moment all the preparations have gone great
5504541 probably unbackable if you want to have a bet on it
5504542 no one is spinning yarns there are 15 or 20 guys that can possibly medal on their day
5504543 seeing what the past olympics have held it hasnt always been the ones that people expect to pop up thats something weve got to be ready for
5504544 ive done what i feel makes me race the best
5504545 its not on purpose i havent raced its just i took a very similar approach to last years race here and it worked well for me so i thought oh well i wont change things
5504546 theres a belt that the physio puts around me and pulls the hip out of joint to stretch it
5504547 if its tight and im training really hard on it like i have been it gets clogged up pretty quickly and it could be game over within a couple of days
5504548 every day the seat belt stretching massage needles ive had a lot i pretty much used to have the physios thumbs deep within my abdominals i consider it normal now it was the only way i could get to beijing

5504550 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
5504551 its obviously worrying people either cant borrow or dont want to borrow even if they can
5504552 there are always short term blips but over the long run m3 has repeatedly shown itself good leading indicator
5504553 she was happy she got engaged about two months ago
5504554 we got a call at 4 45 am and were there within a couple of minutes as it is right next door to the fire brigade headquarters
5504555 she called out to me i could hear her scream abu abu but we were too late
5504556 the bmcs disaster management team took 45 minutes to reach the spot worse it did not have any tool to clear the rubble
5504557 after that the ground floor godown was never opened the toilet block that caved in was right above the godown to repair that portion we needed access from the godown but our landlord never cooperated with us
5504558 we inspected some beams and columns and other unexposed areas like flooring
5504559 prima facie the reason of the collapse is settlement in the foundation due to the monsoon rainwater and dust get collected in the foundation making it brittle
5504560 im excited that an athlete has gone to the olympics and there is a possibility that she will achieve gold with a tiny bit of help from me
5504561 as i watched her i wanted to make muslim womens lives more comfortable and bring them out of the closet

5504563 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5504564 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5504565 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5504566 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5504567 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5504568 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5504569 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5504570 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5504571 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5504572 surely if they found the problem they must know and should have put forward a solution to the vulnerability
5504573 the students presented their research to technical representatives of the mbta and to the fbi a few days before the conference they also provided a confidential paper detailing the problems they found and proposed solutions
5504574 we are aware that both the slides for the intended presentation and the confidential paper have now been made widely publicly available both through the conference materials submitted prior to the filing of the lawsuit and through filings in the public docket in this case by the mbta
5504575 others though see the case involving the students and the massachusetts bay transportation authority mbta as another example of publicity hungry security researchers driven more by ego and the desire for fame than by any sincere interest in improving security
5504576 clear correct and deep this is a welcome addition to discussions of law and computing for anyone even lawyers

5504593 consistently associat ing the shia with the extremism of the wahhabi clergy in saudi arabia
5504594 although the iranian shiites are on the opposite side of the religious divide they have one thing in common with the saudis a priestly cast
5504595 roundly condemn the existence of a religious class of scholars as

5504603 we hope it can be another strong franchise for our portfolio alongside prince of persia or rayman rabbids
5504604 its a new baby for us and we have big hopes

5504698 in many muslim communities there is virtually no support for young women who want to express themselves as creative artists many muslim women are actively discouraged from expressing their thoughts and dreams through music a big part of the problem is the cultural expectations placed upon women there is the association of music with sexuality and a westernised form of expression the main aim i had in putting together the sisterhood project was to let young muslim girls know they are not alone in their struggles to get their music out there
5504699 this is just the first small step towards encouraging these artists and others like them out there to pursue their dreams and hopes and a way to let them know they are not alone female muslim artists face a tough time theres very little support for them but they are not alone as this first collection proves they have something to say and they deserve to be heard hopefully we can help create a platform to have their voices and opinions heard as both artists and muslim women living in western societies
5504700 i wanted to give these young women the support and encouragement i never had as ive had to learn myself no one will do anything for us which is why we have to help each other and create the change ourselves i dont want these women feeling the same isolation and difficulties i had to through the years simply because of my background and choice of career which is why it was essential for me to create this project in an attempt to build a sense of community and a network of support for my fellow sisters and artists my aim is to continue supporting and working with up and coming female artists as well as doing what i can to promote the right to freedom of choice and expression
5504701 this is because in my culture music is considered an unacceptable career choice
5504702 this album was a wonderful creative outlet for me something i desperately needed to do for my own peace of mind

5504738 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5504739 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5504740 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj

5504788 creates pressure on hamas and is likely to accelerate the negotiations over gilad shalit
5504789 the gesture will not make hamas more flexible about its demands because the organization sees that israel is releasing prisoners with blood on their hands which merely causes hamas to harden its position
5504790 hamas is looking despairingly at how despite the fact that it holds shalit it is not succeeding in bringing about a prisoner release while abu mazen abbas who is conducting negotiations with israel is securing a prisoner release
5504791 its enough to see hamas response to the governments decision to understand the pressure the organization is under
5504792 a prisoner release is not interpreted as a gesture but as weakness
5504793 releasing prisoners as a gesture does not attest to weakness but to strength
5504794 prisoner exchange deals attest to weakness far more than does a move made in a manner and at a time convenient to us with the goal of strengthening moderate elements in the palestinian authority

5504828 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with vehement cries and tears to him who was able to save him from death and was heard because of his godly fear though he was a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered
5504829 do you see that faith was working together with his works and by works faith was made perfect
5504830 what separates a perfect faith one that saves from an incomplete faith one that james calls a
5504831 we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith
5504832 for the son of man will come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he will reward each
5504833 ive been online since second grade i know how to take care of myself my parents worry about me too much if some weird person comes on in a strange way i just delete and or ignore them
5504834 this will continue until we are mature just as christ is and we will be completely like him
5504835 we cant even imagine what we will be like when christ returns but we do know that when he comes we will be like him for we will see him as he really is
5504836 dont become so well adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking instead fix your attention on god youll be changed from the inside out unlike the culture around you always dragging you down to its level of immaturity god brings the best out of you develops well formed maturity in you
5504837 the results at leeds town hall were pretty conclusive as the episode shows
5504838 we had all kinds of activity which proves to my mind that spirits are all around us
5504839 the cells were a fantastic location filled with a real sense of atmosphere and being completely honest a horrible feeling of foreboding
5504840 as viewers will see we ended up with much more than we bargained for
5504841 this is a real first for the yorkshire evening post
5504842 this is a fully fledged series of programmes that we hope will prove to be truly groundbreaking for our website
5504843 these buildings are iconic and we were lucky enough to be given unprecedented access to parts the public never gets to see
5504844 this series represents the opportunities the web has given newspapers like ours
5504845 with this series were hopefully going to show what can be achieved by pushing our own relatively modest understanding of video to its limit
5504846 its a testament to the willingness of our staff to adapt and embrace modern technology to enable them to successfully explore new mediums outside the realms of print
5504847 i used to change nappies in the days before pampers so youve actually got to fold the cloth youve got to put it on youve got to put the safety pin i havent pricked any baby yet if i can do it that means anybody can do it
5504848 these measures all add up to a very significant package we are talking of about maybe s 700 million a year if more babies are born it will be more than s 700 million a year but even that is about double of what we are spending today on child incentives and all together we will have about s 1 6 billion spent a year or 0 6 per cent of gdp
5504849 the only way to vote for the principled heroic maverick mccain is if you had a time machine
5504850 we didnt have too much to test a couple of new tyres and thats about it but we managed to find a new setting to improve on what was already a very good situation i managed to drop my lap times by almost a second on yesterday and thats really positive
5504851 unfortunately my physical condition on friday and the rain on saturday meant that we didnt head into the race in the best possible shape
5504852 it is less painful to learn in youth than to be ignorant in age
5504853 you must be a good woman a good woman will have a nice birthday i love grabbing your head im sure you love it too
5504854 i didnt come to roast bob saget i came to fuck john stamos
5504855 d listed is like chicks who hang out together for a long time they start getting their periods the same day
5504856 four of our crews were able to contain the blaze to the north eastern end of the building but they discovered that that part of the building actually housed people
5504857 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5504858 if theres a slender chance its mother is still out there then it may hear it further out to sea
5504859 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out
5504860 if people try to swim with whales theres a good chance they can distress the mother this is how they get abandoned
5504861 it might be a peaceful experience for people but its not for the whale
5504862 when we have kids its a decision of three people
5504863 when my son was ten i asked him if he wanted to come and we went all round the world changing schools
5504864 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
5504865 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
5504866 they are not exactly the most high class group of women
5504867 were going to work this summer to get better and better and well look at everything were going to let a little time go by then re group and look at everything objectively try and get better and get to where we ultimately need to be
5504868 but there was a lot of stuff we asked him to not put in the book and some stuff he did on his own we miss james james was great for us and his wife is even nicer than he is
5504869 obama was not a churchgoer at the time but he found himself returning to the sanctuary of trinity united in wright he had found both a spiritual mentor and a role model
5504870 obama says that rather than advising him on strategy wright helps keep his priorities straight and his moral compass calibrated
5504871 hes much more of a sounding board for me to make sure that i am speaking as truthfully about what i believe as possible and that im not losing myself in some of the hype and hoopla and stress thats involved in national politics
5504872 when obama sought his own church community he felt increasingly at home at trinity before leaving for harvard law school in 1988 he responded to one of wrights altar calls and declared a personal relationship with jesus christ
5504873 though wright and obama do not often talk one on one often the senator does check with his pastor before making any bold political moves last fall obama approached wright to broach the possibility of running for president wright cautioned obama not to let politics change him but he also encouraged obama win or lose
5504874 the government lied about inventing the hiv virus as a means of genocide against people of color the government lied
5504875 the government gives them the drugs builds bigger prisons passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing god bless america no no no god damn america thats in the bible for killing innocent people god damn america for treating our citizens as less than human god damn america for as long as she acts like she is god and she is supreme
5504876 we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because of stuff we have done overseas is now brought back into our own backyard america is chickens coming home to roost
5504877 barack knows what it means to be a black man to be living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people hillary can never know that hillary aint never been called a n
5504878 how many children of biracial parents can make it in a world controlled by racist ideology
5504879 when hillary was crying gesturing tears uproarious laughter from audience and people said that was put on i really dont believe it was put on
5504880 ant to have to answer for everything thats stated in a church
5504881 we had all of our regulars play at least 70 minutes today
5504882 the boys were coming off three straight days of double training sessions so i think we were a bit flat we had some tired legs but we expected it as thats the nature of the preseason
5504883 overall i think the boys had a good sense of what we were trying to accomplish
5504884 we were steady in the back but i felt we had to defend a bit too much
5504885 will quickly have a detrimental effect upon the prosecution of criminal defendants and clearly represents a very real and serious threat to the safety of the citizens of dekalb county
5504886 porque me secuestraste la luna el coraz n mis pensamientos la palabra mis ilusiones la mirada secuestraste a una ni a la misma ni a que hoy por hoy camina de tu mano
5504887 chaos does not mean disorder it represents an abstract cosmic principle referring to the source of creation
5504888 i accept chaos im not sure whether it accepts me
5504889 assembling top ten lists of blogs by category to help you discover the best sites that you never knew existed
5504890 genuinely cares about the problems of people like me we appreciate his continued trips to montana to let us know that we are not forgotten
5504891 senator mccain has become a strong supporter of the bush policies policies which have led to disaster both at home and abroad
5504892 this is everyman he is kansan and he is kenyan he is african and he is anglo american he is common sense and he is eloquence he is dynamic and he is down to earth
5504893 barack obama has inspired me to believe in politics again and most importantly the power of the ordinary citizen
5504894 although i still identify as a republican and still stand for some conservative values i finally feel like america has found a leader it can look up to and trust
5504895 the link between our countrys lack of an effective energy policy and our flawed foreign policy
5504896 i havent felt so energized since mccarthy trying to end the vietnam war
5504897 i would love to be a part of this historical event its so long overdue
5504898 the boys call me e rock and i do all i can to make a difference in their lives
5504899 this was the first campaign i felt i needed to support i dont have a lot of money but i donate what i can because i believe in barack
5504900 as a christian i have seen it repeated that evangelical christians are required to vote republican when i heard baracks call to renewal speech i was surprised this is change i can believe in and many other young evangelical christians can believe in too for the first time in my life i got hooked on politics

5504917 you have to have a larger backpack and with the little guys you worry about that

5504922 it is ridiculous they jais cannot just barge into the pub arrest and issue summonses to muslim workers and patrons simply because they were patrons and workers of a place that serves alcohol
5504923 jais certainly does not have any right to arrest people without police officers present
5504924 the other 56 have been asked to assist in investigations they are not charged but have been asked to give their statements
5504925 it does not make any sense and certainly is insulting to us without conducting any breathalyser tests they assumed we drank alcohol when in actual fact none of us did
5504926 on the one hand we have the unity culture arts and heritage ministry encouraging more local talents to perform in five star hotels and here we have people raiding the place

5504937 this kind of thing happens in improvisation two things running concurrently in haphazard fashion suddenly synchronize autonomously and sling you forcibly into a new phase
5504938 since on hearing the initial sound in a free improvisation neither the performers nor the audience know exactly what direction the music will take
5504939 are forced to rely on the accumulate knowledge of prior musical experience and the assimilation of underlying codes embedded within it to attempt to evaluate and derive meaning from such performance
5504940 pulse texture use of the instruments full frequency range dynamics density timbre interplay between performers when there is more than one thats too much to keep in your conscious mind all at once but after a while one learns how to recognize these elements intuitively and from then on listening attentively becomes easier i think thats one reason why it is so hard for some listeners to appreciate free improv music they are used to listening for melody and not used to listening for density or texture so they dont know how to decode freely improvised music and as a result it ends up sounding like random noise to them

5504946 we have had so many regulations thrown at us because of brussels lack of scientific understanding
5504947 this is the biggest issue that we have had to face for a long time
5504948 they are looking at this through a hazard mechanism rather than a practical mechanism
5504949 its like crossing the road up to now we have been able to cross the road under our own assessment under this hazard method we wouldnt be able to cross the road we would have to build a bridge
5504950 its the ones that are most effective and that are safest that they are going to be taking out
5504951 we will be incurring the same costs but with less yield
5504952 we will end up eating food that has been grown using pesticides that are banned in this country
5504953 you have to do the same worldwide or you are not achieving anything
5504954 as people are trying to cut back by eating out less and buying fewer takeaways it looks as though they may be looking for a little indulgence in the supermarket by ensuring that if they need to cook at home they are going to get the best experience they can what these figures are suggesting for the moment is that scotch beef is fitting the bill as far as answering peoples indulgence for foods is concerned
5504955 we understand the position but we would encourage scots to enter as usual if for some reason they are unable to bring livestock to the show all entry fees will be refunded
5504956 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5504957 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5504958 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5504959 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5504960 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5504961 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5504962 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5504963 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5504964 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5504965 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5504966 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5504967 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5504968 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5504969 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5504970 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5504971 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5504972 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5504973 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5504974 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5504975 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5504976 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5504977 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5504978 it is kind of frustrating wondering who the starting quarterback is
5504979 thats probably one of the most important players on the team is the quarterback now that weve got it all resolved and we know who the starter is then now we can get down to business
5504980 theres other names up there that are just astounding some of our favorite artists and politicians
5504981 but its going to be really cool to see that in 10 years 20 years from now
5504982 a lot of kids first feel lonely when they first get diagnosed with diabetes im just so encouraged at the end of the day because all im trying to do is make it through another day managing diabetes
5504983 theyre just doing the same thing were all there for each other
5504984 we on stage run around constantly for about an hour and 45 minutes and we know what that can do you just feel great at the end of the night and when you wake up in the morning
5504985 kids to get our there and go to the parks and really really enjoy the outdoors and i know that was really important to us when we were kids so try to make it important to them too
5504986 but we do me and joe are both of voting age so we do endorse voting getting to know the issues learning about the candidates and making a decision for yourself
5504987 its going to take away our peace harmony tranquillity and privacy
5504988 look at the business owner who is soooo cool that he doesnt have to deal with all of the crap that the rest of us do
5504989 yup youre right its nice not having that stuff going through my head being a business owner is awesome
5504990 yes thats definitely true but like anything else in life there are trade offs
5504991 arroyo with the us backing is setting up the grand stage to uphold and justify her urge for cha cha and martial rule
5504992 arroyo is bound to unleash in full scale her war machine that is willing to destroy not only all what is left for the bangsamoro but all dents of democracy the filipino people have fought for
5504993 frustrated vendors have been placing their property in the market to let as they have been unable to agree sales due to a lack of demand in the housing market
5504994 many would be buyers have been forced to rent as the route to mortgage finance has been blocked
5504995 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term
5504996 however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5504997 a major factor in recent weeks is that many unsold houses are being withdrawn from sale and offered for rental instead
5504998 there is an oversupply of rental property in the market due to property owners unable to sell their properties attempting to let them
5504999 well i read that nostradamus prophesied that a man in a blue turban was going to take over the world
5505000 it becomes obvious that nostradamus cared little for the bible but he used it to suit his own purposes
5505001 the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one
5505002 we wont give up on that and that is exactly where our decision making starts
5505003 i have got a style of rugby that i want to implement we have progressed really great but the first thing we did if there was nothing on was go to ground
5505004 slow ball management isnt what we want to do we want quick ball we will definitely be working on that this week
5505005 we have with electronic arts the distribution partner we needed to give these 3 titles the market share they deserve on the german market place with our home made amp already successful my baby boy my baby girl game the powerful hello kitty license at last available on ds and the adaptation for the very first time in a video game of the manga star detective conan we have a relevant and valuable offer to hit the so competitive casual games market at christmas time
5505006 the games developed and produced by nobilis expand the ea product line in a direction of easily accessible and attractively interactive entertainment for casual gamers these products are designed particularly for children and young girls who constitute very attractive and important target groups for us nobilis the ea brand identity and our sales strength complement each other extraordinarily well and will contribute to even greater success for all

5505029 to earthling man his way does not belong it does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step
5505030 10 and just a little while longer and the wicked one will be no more and you will certainly give attention to his place and he will not be 11 but the meek ones themselves will possess the earth and they will find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace 29 the righteous themselves will possess the earth and they will reside forever upon it
5505031 and they will certainly build houses and have occupancy and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage they will not build and someone else have occupancy they will not plant and someone else do the eating for like the days of a tree will the days of my people be and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full they will not toil for nothing nor will they bring to birth for disturbance because they are the offspring made up of the blessed ones of jehovah and their descendents with them and it will actually occur that before they call out i myself shall answer while they are yet speaking i myself shall hear
5505032 desperate group of people trying to make something out of nothing

5505034 that is how i discovered that soccerpro is actually a pretty darn cool business with plenty of things to offer and not limited to soccer merchandise
5505035 striving to provide the finest soccer equipment available and seeking to promote the enjoyment of soccer by helping soccer players of all levels play better soccer
5505036 subject yourselves therefore to god but oppose the devil and he will flee from you
5505037 evil among us 1 whats the fascination with the occult
5505038 is it just not common knowledge among people that these things have roots in things demonic and pagan
5505039 probably late last year and early this year we had a few issues

5505072 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5505073 when i got to the scene there was a coach overturned there were many walking wounded being seen to by ambulance staff and half a dozen with head wounds
5505074 the coach had ploughed through a garden and two cars parked on a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5505075 its an extremely dangerous road it is an old road and because buses and coaches are so wide now the road cannot cope with them there has been talk of a bypass for the village for the past 25 years and nothing has been done about it
5505076 its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened
5505077 i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police i was told his brakes must have failed

5505089 i think there is likely to be an appeal from some source or another
5505090 he was required to consider and balance the interests of all noteholders not just the interests of the appellants whose notes represent only about 3 percent of that total
5505091 it does not contain a comprehensive code that lays out all that is permitted and barred
5505092 we kept the bureau open through some previous tough times
5505093 frankly i made a choice between the bureau in springfield and local news in the rock river valley its a loss but losing another local reporter would have been worse
5505094 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5505095 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5505096 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5505097 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5505098 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5505099 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5505100 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5505101 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship

5505103 the main drawback is that you have to keep the camera still for a second or two when taking snaps to avoid blur and it is not quite so good with close up work access to the web was almost instantaneous but using google still isnt user friendly enough of the new features the barcode reader which has big potential for linking newspapers directly to the web worked ok on the fts front page bar code but not on the observers the gps satellite positioning which opens up huge possibilities for local search worked moodily maybe because of a fault with this model the n95 has a videophone which may come into its own one day but i have never seen anyone using one its expensive for a phone

5505107 as a lacto ovo vegetarian a volunteer at the saving grace animal shelters thrift store a supporter of the people for the ethical treatment of animals peta and a longtime pet owner you could say i care about animals rodeos serve no purpose other than entertainment for the audience and a demonstration of the cowboy or cowgirls skills i understand that these events are usually skills necessary to care for livestock for example the roping events can be used to get an animal closer to give medical treatment i simply dont understand rodeos because they put the animals in unnecessary danger these events also glorify the inhumane treatment of animals however people make a living off of raising livestock for meat milk and other products if livestock must be raised to keep food on these peoples tables then we should make every effort to ensure that the animals are not mistreated unnecessarily rodeos to me fit in that category of mistreatment and abuse
5505108 i have never been to a rodeo so i have never actually seen what goes on during the event but to better my understanding on what does occur i looked online most of the events i saw consist of a person riding a cow horse or a bull fighting to stay atop as long as they can others are timed events in which the cowboy leaps from his horse grabs the steers horns and attempts to throw the animal to the ground keeping that in mind those are two very different events one in which is pure fun whereas the other raises the question of abuse in order for these animals to perform as they should they are trained with whips and lassos there is always a line that cannot be crossed and although not all rodeo events are harmful to the animals some do in fact cross that line so with the little knowledge that i have on the subject i think that depending on the event rodeos can depict animal abuse
5505109 rodeos have been around in the earliest form for a very long time i remember going to the south douglas rodeo when i was younger and wanting a bunny my mom of course said no from bull riding to bunny rabbits rodeos are for all ages the question of animal abuse never crossed my mind anything people do at the rodeo has just been a part of it roping events have always been one of my favorite events not only is a challenge for the person roping but it is entertaining to watch i know i would never be able to do that it takes lots of time and hard work for people to rope cows ride bulls and barrel race now thats cool to watch i see rodeos more as a result of hard work or a challenge than animal abuse

5505126 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5505127 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5505128 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5505129 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5505130 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5505131 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5505132 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship

5505140 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there

5505143 we are not spending more on fuel this year because were driving less
5505144 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5505145 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5505146 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5505147 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5505148 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5505149 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5505150 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one
5505151 the shit he did thats what got me into heavy music vulgar display of power i was only into eighties music before that the heaviest thing i listened to was skinny puppy and ministry but that wasnt metal when i heard vulgar display i was like holy shit what the fuck is this the first time i ever saw them live before korn was even signed me and fieldy korn bassist went and it was pantera and sepultura at irving meadows in l a they came out started the first song the curtain dropped and me and fieldy just started crying we looked at each other and we had tears in our eyes because it was so fucking intense and heavy and sick
5505152 i always compare it to when steve perry went and did oh sherrie which is a fucking journey song
5505153 it sounded exactly like journey and thats fucked up i dont want to do that
5505154 i feel like im waving the flag for musicianship trying to bring back bands that can play
5505155 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
5505156 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
5505157 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
5505158 i could write a book on this one subject alone if only you did great grandpa grizzly that would be very interesting to see how these imported scalists socialists could come and organize the farmers and i w w s to gather and organization that would destroy the farmers first and then all other taxpayers and to this day there is lots of farmers just as blind as ever
5505159 and let us consider how we may spur one another on towards love and good deeds let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching

5505190 i think 75 percent plus one vote is a great victory the rest is irrelevant the cme was able to get a super majority as they presented a strong proposition
5505191 cme wants this so badly because the futures market is one of the few monopolies left in the world and its a monopoly because they have their own clearing operation

5505199 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5505200 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5505201 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5505202 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5505203 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5505204 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5505256 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia
5505257 la polic a estableci un mando de tres generales en santa cruz y es una decisi n muy importante porque le est diciendo claramente al prefecto rub n costas que usted no tiene ninguna atribuci n de actuar en el mando de la polic a porque no est con la ley

5505265 send a letter to your mother telling her you love her
5505266 and as it gets bigger well youll figure it out
5505267 the pet shop owner said i should feed it crickets for now so im going to go find some
5505268 i said opening my eyes and i saw a huge pair of purple eyes staring back at me i screamed a little and threw the blankets over my head hoping whatever purple eyed beast next to my bed would simply think i had disappeared and would disappear itself
5505269 its me the lizard ive gotten bigger because ive eaten a steady supply of crickets all night i ate all the crickets i could eat then i went into the fridge and finished off the pizza and pasta in there and all your beer
5505270 send a letter to your mother telling her you love her
5505271 when you wish upon a falling star your dreams can come true unless its really a meteorite hurtling to the earth which will destroy all life then youre pretty much screwed no matter what you wish for unless its death by meteor

5505274 these things are a complete out of left field surprise
5505275 the ideal way is to figure out a way to puff them up to make them bigger without changing their mass
5505276 but its hard to come up with a model that can do that
5505277 there is no known process that can make that big an increase in size
5505278 the time you need in order to puff up galaxies by a factor of two or three is too long and these galaxies dont have the time
5505279 i need some time to think but someone of his size should be winning more headers
5505280 how many times i told myself what an idiot i was
5505281 i also feared that i would never regain that which was most in my heart
5505282 but i told the president of the federation that i was available if things at the euros didnt go right he knew he would be able to count on me for the future
5505283 donadoni said that not everyone behaved correctly with him he was certainly not referring to me
5505284 two years ago there was the need to build a group from nothing
5505285 there was the need to make the people fall in love again with the national side
5505286 the pleasure at the victory was great also because of that
5505287 this time the squad is already there its only a matter of taking them forward the elements which allowed us to win will be recreated
5505288 i admit its a group that are a bit old but i am certain they still have a lot to give and on that base we will calmly bring in the best youngster from the under 21 side it will be up to them to give enthusiasm and freshness
5505289 i want to start again with a good victory the first time around we started with a defeat as happened with world cup winning coach enzo bearzot who then won in 1982 but this time we want to be different
5505290 the world champions arent here because of gratitude even if i will nourish that sentiment for life towards them
5505291 who gets in to the national side does so on merit
5505292 if i never see that pilot again it will be too soon
5505293 pilots are difficult id never written a pilot script before and i was by myself trying to figure out how to do this
5505294 we changed a few things we changed a couple of actors but thats not a reflection on them
5505295 one thing we figured out thats been important to me is that no matter how elastic and insane their world is crazy things can happen to these people but the people must be real at their core and care about each other
5505296 we didnt have the money to build an office in the pilot for ray fiske emmy nominee zeljko ivanek so we decided wed pick him up wherever he happened to be in his life
5505297 it actually lent a great deal of character to fiske
5505298 and made it seem that he was always out doing things as opposed to just being in his office we ended up building an office when we got ordered for a series but it was a great way just by necessity to establish his character if we had to do it again with a bigger budget wed probably opt to do the same thing
5505299 coming from a world where there are 60 shooting days seeing what youre able to do in eight is a revelation
5505300 from the beginning we knew it was going to be a slow and steady process if we kept it true viewers would come
5505301 we didnt really have a lot of time before the pilot to think about what the show was going to be either creatively or in production
5505302 before it even premiered people thought it was a fantastic pilot but there were enormous concerns about whether it had viability as a series
5505303 this is the hallmark of our entire philosophy which we learned early on
5505304 branislav chose milan and he told that to the club and for that reason he will probably wear the rossoneri shirt this next season
5505305 the deal will be done because no one will keep an unhappy player
5505306 the problem at the moment is that chelsea want four starters in the position and he is the fourth its difficult to find a replacement of the same level so the blues want to keep him and the deal has stalled
5505307 maikons injury is terribly serious and strange he tore the back and front cruciate ligaments and also the collateral ligament
5505308 the surgery may be scheduled for wednesday in sao paulo and the recovery period will be between six and eight months
5505309 he is young and his age helps he has enough time to fully recover he is fine but he hasnt realised what really happened
5505310 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5505311 we still have a lot of time we will see
5505312 im not worried much about the lack of goals in the pre season games which serve to help you work on fitness and the way the team plays
5505313 after the pain and the feelings of yesterday night i feared that i had compromised my season
5505314 the possibility that my cruciate had been affected was the part that worried me the most
5505315 bum bum bum bum mi madre seilor mun mi padre pavarotti io so francesco totti
5505316 in this parking lot were standing on a couple hundred dead puritans
5505317 we are disappointed by the loss but we must keep our heads up go forward and think of motagua
5505318 i hope they can enjoy this you dont play the copa sudamericana every day
5505319 the victory gave us confidence to keep doing as we have been doing we want to show that we are an aggressive team who play good football
5505320 struggle with stage fright and sensitivities about appearing too forward pushy or intrusive

5505322 this new site demonstrates usps commitment to ensuring the quality and safety of pharmaceuticals dietary supplements and food ingredients for everyone regardless of geographic economic or political borders

5505324 usp brazil will work closely with anvisa the brazilian pharmacopeia febrafarma and other organizations to help ensure the quality of medicines and food ingredients and better serve our customers

5505420 although jesus is the resurrection the one who may never die he suffers and dies he suffers the world if we are allowed to abuse the language a little we could say that jesus is worlded he calls out from the world what is most intrinsic to it death and summons it together to a single point that of the cross when jesus calls death comes out of the world jesus is able to break open the world and separate death from it the indivisible spirit drives division out the world is jesused death has no claim on him so it finds nothing in him by which it can gain purchase death is deathed the spirit makes the son indivisible and so impregnable the world cannot break him
5505421 in killing jesus the regime made the sacrifice that put the whole people out of relationship with their god

5505437 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute

5505486 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognising the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5505487 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5505488 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5505489 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5505490 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5505491 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5505492 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5505493 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5505494 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5505495 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5505496 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects

5505535 the boss wants to see me it must be bad
5505536 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5505537 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5505538 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5505539 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5505540 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5505541 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5505542 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5505543 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5505544 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5505545 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5505546 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5505547 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5505548 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5505549 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5505550 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5505551 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5505552 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5505553 good position to work with and others on the problem
5505554 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5505555 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5505556 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5505557 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5505558 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5505559 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5505560 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5505561 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5505562 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5505563 i dont know the time but the suns been up for hours
5505564 did a fff fff bad thing once and i must atone for what i did the girls name is elli and shes dying theres no hope of saving her unless i find what im seeking

5505585 it goes like this bill when i was 17 my school mates and i would imagine that we were in fantasy bands too we were disgustingly rich and famous the biggest bands in the world but because teachers were always on our backs we had to conduct our interviews in secret via our sketch books so eh what im basically proposing is that in tribute to our fantasy bands we conduct this interview in writing on some sketch paper
5505586 forty percent of undocumented students at uc campuses are asian but you would never know it because of the stigma about something which is not our fault
5505587 filipinos believe tago ng tago hide and hide our status but we have to come out of the shadows if we want to change immigration policy
5505588 especially in a post 9 11 world we have to claim our full identities if we want equal treatment and an end to discrimination
5505589 yes it is scary to stand at press conferences or hearings or speaking engagements and be identified as undocumented but it would be much more scary if we didnt speak out

5505593 dress was unanimously cordially disliked has the television service not the right of discussing the matter of dress with soloists in order that they should look as well as possible on the screen the cut away shots to members of the audience should be handled with care while the thoughtful girl made a most attractive picture and interfered in no way with the music the shots of the youth in the grey topper and of the shop girl wagging her head in time to the music are frankly not conducive to concentration on the music and i think better kept to the intervals between items
5505594 these people have uploaded games and made them available to tens of thousands of people
5505595 what they are trying to do is deter people from illegally filesharing their games this is not a massive revenue generating exercise

5505599 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
5505600 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
5505601 they compete in the number of weapons and unfortunately its easy for someone to compare this game to that game this game has 10 multiplayer levels but this one has 29 so clearly this game must be better
5505602 if you can imagine if movies competed in this way well sure schindlers list was good but i know this three and a half hour long movie think of the value youre getting for your ten dollars it doesnt work that way and unfortunately we still find ourselves competing this way we have to compete in quality not size
5505603 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
5505604 theyre songs written by a young man and originally recorded when he was a young man
5505605 but now tragically im not a young man anymore and i am singing about getting old when i am old
5505606 i think what they are doing is mining the value of the work that they created
5505607 if i was an artist i would be doing this i would reinterpret my songs look what joni mitchell has done i think some of the most brilliant work shes done is a reinterpretation
5505608 theyre getting to play with what they created ive got a set of blocks im gonna stack em this way or im gonna stack em that way an hommage to my own work i think its cool
5505609 my sense of things was whatever kind of spotlight we would have on us would be a lot more than weve had in the last few years and i think it would be a very enjoyable ride for everybody
5505610 id love to make a bigger splash this go round the band is playing beautifully
5505611 jimmy rightfully said if were going to introduce this thing to a lot of people that may not know who you are or that have heard about you but have never really investigated you what would we put in front of them
5505612 we never actually talked about it but it seems to me this is a pretty good party album
5505613 our two goals were ok we want something that will attract young listeners and two something that maybe we can get played in film and television
5505614 not only are we hoping to get some new younger fans and keep the old fans entertained but at the same time give people an alternate take on something that may actually trigger them to go back and revisit the original
5505615 going to those songs again and doing them with this band made me appreciate them in a different kind of way
5505616 it was an interesting process when youre singing a song like motel blues which was written by a 23 year old guy and then youre singing it and youre 61 and the line is come up to my motel room and save my life it has a whole other kind of layer and meaning to it which again i hope listeners will find interesting
5505617 i think people either love it or hate it there hasnt been a lot of middle ground the annoying part if it is inevitably youre going to get this stance from press well its not as good as the original
5505618 thats such an easy and weak stance to take i know its not that was recorded in the late 60s with the incredible old gear and incredible musicians and producers who took their time with it and my dad was in his 20s then i know theyre not better than the originals
5505619 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5505620 whether im impeached or not the countrys stability will be compromised the office of the president will also be insulted pakistan is my love now and always my life is for pakistan i have defended and will continue to defend pakistan i want to be able to bring pakistan out of the current crisis so i think perhaps i should do something but i also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country i also want to save the parliament from horse trading even if the impeachment is defeated the relations between the presidents office and the coalition govt will not heal therefore with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors i have decided to resign from my post
5505621 how much i hate india and how much i will sacrifice to save muslim brothers in kashmir
5505622 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5505623 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5505624 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5505625 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5505626 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
5505627 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5505628 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
5505629 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
5505630 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
5505631 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
5505632 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
5505633 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
5505634 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5505635 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops

5505644 oh well i understand where you are coming from but i believe in this and also that
5505645 we have a lot of windows so the upper level is still fairly well lit

5505647 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
5505648 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5505649 the first thing everyone needs to understand about the deficit is that we have a spending problem not a revenue problem no one should feel guilty that they are not sending enough money to olympia the problem is that governor gregoire and the legislators have spent it at an unsustainable rate
5505650 in order to stop the bleeding and get our state on a fiscally sustainable path we must bring our spending back in line with recurring revenue growth the people have shown support for spending limits and a constitutional amendment would keep out of control government spending in check the fact is if i 601 were still in place our state would not be facing a multi billion dollar budget deficit
5505651 i recognize that 6 million is just a drop in the bucket in solving a 2 7 billion deficit but this will help send a message that the days of bloated bureaucracy in olympia are over
5505652 leadership must start at the top and i believe the governor should set an example for the other state agencies and departments
5505653 under governor christine gregoire the size of the state government continues to grow while state services do not improve
5505654 over the past four years the state has budgeted for an increase of more than 8 000 new full time employees a case of the governor for the government caring more about creating more bureaucracy than providing efficient services to the people
5505655 to ensure real savings we should implement a reasonable responsible and detailed plan to freeze hiring like the one proposed by state senator joe zarelli that addresses both the massive expansion of state government and gregoires 2 7 billion deficit gregoires recent call for a hiring freeze was short on specifics and leaves us with little assurance that the agencies will actually implement this hiring freeze asking nicely may score political points but does not mean that an actual hiring freeze will occur
5505656 the voters are worse off for it they should have more clarity not less
5505657 one of the things we find in this area is this there is poverty and we know poverty and obesity go hand and hand
5505658 just like smoking issue was in the past everyone has to get involved
5505659 this is a huge financial issue for our communities if we allow this problem to continue at the same pace as in the 90s this will put a huge pressure on our health care system
5505660 health care issues are important but this economy is really hurting people and people in the north country are concerned about a government in washington thats not representing them
5505661 y no restringi ndolas como las estamos viendo en m s de alg n lugar
5505662 usually the hottest part of the season you get your blue green algae but with the water so high and so much movement we havent seen it
5505663 we usually come down here quite a bit and catch quite a few fish but today it was different its just theres a lot of algae in the water over there
5505664 when asked to think beyond day to day politics vermonters share a high level of agreement in terms of values and concerns
5505665 refuerzan la idea de que es viable reducir la inflaci n al objetivo del 4 5 por ciento en 2009
5505666 comenz a afectar a las expectativas de inflaci n controlando los efectos de su aceleraci n en 2008 respecto de lo que se preve a
5505667 ligeramente por debajo del techo previsto pero orient ndose hacia el centro del objetivo 4 5 por ciento durante 2009
5505668 son una indicaci n clara de la credibilidad del banco central
5505669 no es solo un proyecto econ mico sino tambi n pol tico
5505670 es fundamental para los pa ses peque os del bloque abrir oportunidades y facilitar las negociaciones
5505671 no es solo un proyecto econ mico sino tambi n pol tico
5505672 confiamos en que el ingreso definitivo de venezuela al bloque se defina antes de finales de 2008
5505673 para que llegue m s y mejor a nuestras sociedades
5505674 durante los pr ximos meses queremos ampliar la cooperaci n en el rea social y alimentaria
5505675 i cant explain it level of frustration anger there are all sorts of different factors they dont tie into each other you cant say the economys causing this people are out of work things like that
5505676 if things continue the way they are it doesnt look good
5505677 vermonts homicide rate tends to be a roller coaster with a peak then a valley then another peak
5505678 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
5505679 planning preparation initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties agreements or assurances
5505680 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
5505681 there were balls of meat and we tried to get them and they had already disposed of them when we got there
5505682 we are asking pet owners to please keep their cats indoors and their dogs outside of walking them on a leash
5505683 what a big load off my plate i see a martini in my future for certain
5505684 we will make a reasonably fair attack on that in this years budget but you cant wipe a 52 million deficit in one year
5505685 our plan is to get the budget back into a surplus over a five year period
5505686 its a budget that has substantial capital works and program expenditure
5505687 we are certainly moving in the area of major water and sewerage upgrade there will be substantial expenditure on roads as you would expect
5505688 we have indicated that there will be some funding in the budget for long tan and kokoda pools as that is needed to bring them up to useable standard
5505689 we are very strong on our environmental aspects and this budget will have substantial expenditure in that area
5505690 we have already seen some significant rises come through council especially in the little areas like dog registration and stuff like that
5505691 we have seen some significant rises in environmental health and i think they are just a sign of things to come
5505692 i am going to keep my eye on pensioner subsidies spending and where the money is really going
5505693 they talk about cutting money from pr but a lot of the money is just going to be pushed into other areas
5505694 i think towards the end of the election campaign everyone was so keen they were saying things they couldnt keep but hes made commitments to people and he has to live up to it
5505695 the girl was walking to school when a man grabbed her from behind and touched her inappropriately
5505696 we are asking for any witnesses to come forward we dont know what else this man has been up to
5505697 surely then every conversation from then on may not be admissable as evidence
5505698 my goal for this olympics is to do a personal best and i think that if i can do that then the result will be what i want
5505699 in between training sessions im just trying to relax listen to music and make my way through the whole series of family guy its best cartoon on the box
5505700 i talk constantly with family and friends and without their support and encouragement i wouldnt be where i am today
5505701 the problem is steel windows are not usually weather proof
5505702 but we have got on to a really good designer
5505703 the attention to detail is probably four times as much as just starting with a blank piece of paper
5505704 the nyt newsroom was buzzing late monday afternoon after obama beat reporter jeff zeleny learned how the dem hopeful has now finalized his choice for a running mate obama has set out an elaborate roll out to
5505705 were taking about 20 people to each including editors reporters bloggers and a videographer
5505706 i was recently stopped by homeland security as i was returning from a trip to syria what i saw in the hours that followed shocked and disturbed me
5505707 we cant ask them to stop operating during ramadan without giving gt gt them an alternative means of income as this is our moral obligation
5505708 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5505709 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
5505710 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5505711 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5505712 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5505713 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5505714 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5505715 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5505716 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5505717 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5505718 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5505719 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5505720 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5505721 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5505722 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5505723 any questions about the vice presidential thing are understandable and its good for my ego but i should probably let sen obama and his campaign address those kinds of questions
5505724 if we would have preemptively worked with russia with georgia making sure that nato had the kind of ability and the presence and the engagement we could have perhaps avoided this we dont know but because the bush mccain approach has been to focus almost exclusively on iraq over the last five years a lot of these issues have gone without the kind of attention
5505725 our long term goal is not to have an adversarial relationship with russia but it cannot be business as usual
5505726 we have to take a look at all the elements of the relationship and this of course would include high level meetings

5505736 respeto de los derechos humanos debe extenderse a todos los inmigrantes regulares y clandestinos

5505745 naturally im thrilled that louis and jordan will be with us this season because they are outstanding young men who will be vital to our teams success
5505746 they will continue to pursue their educations and represent lsu in a first class manner
5505747 at the same time its important that we remain committed to enhancing their opportunities to pursue professional baseball careers at the end of their senior years
5505748 four lsu signees that were selected in the draft will also report to campus monday including outfielder mikie mahtook of st
5505749 we have a talented group of 10 freshmen including the four that were drafted
5505750 they delayed their entrances into pro ball to get great educations and win championships for lsu as with louis and jordan its our responsibility as a program to put the young players into the best possible positions to pursue pro baseball careers when they again become draft eligible

5505759 most important id like the ability to provide this information to other women who come across this site and for the men who would like to feel comfortable suggesting it here is some information ive found regarding resveratrol and women phytoestrogen a naturally occurring non steroidal compounds that are similar in structure to steroidal estradiol in women the most commonly researched effects this could have on women is with regards to hrt drugs or hrt is most commonly used for women who are post menopausal to help give them hormones estrogen they lose as they age these therapies help to balance the hormonal levels that tend to fluctuate throughout menopause the problem with these therapies is they have been found to carry the risk for serious side effects including breast cancer strokes heart attack and blood clot risks benefits of resveratrol in womens health
5505760 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people

5505796 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers
5505797 we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5505798 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5505799 and they did travel they used to move down to mildura they used to go out to moree they used to go all these areas doing the fruit picking doing the cotton chipping

5505807 we think that the rebound in the us dollar in general has overshot
5505808 scope for a less restrictive stance on monetary policy in the period ahead

5505828 a better than expected year financially and ahead of where the firm was last year despite a recession

5505863 they want you to agree to install zango in order to view whole movies some streamed on the movietvonline site from other sources others in the form of broken up downloads hosted on file downloading sites
5505864 heres a shot of what appears to be a badly made camcorder complete with people talking and scrunching up paper in the background streamed on the site

5505868 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5505869 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5505870 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5505871 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense

5505874 893 won the best student piece it was stylish and gorgeous to look at but was rather obtuse
5505875 the basic conclusion is that after only three months the students in the usda program were more willing to try fruit and vegetables at school
5505876 the data seems to indicate that the sooner kids are introduced to fruit and vegetables the more likely they are to choose them as snacks instead of candy and soda
5505877 were a little too dependent on the schools for data
5505878 about 95 percent of the students looked forward to the snacks
5505879 kids teachers and parents all thought it was a great idea
5505880 most students had not tried kiwis before but they were a big hit
5505881 and i am always seeing kids eating blueberry flavored candy so it was nice to be able to offer kids real blueberries which they loved
5505882 its much better than having candy and soda machines in the lunchroom
5505883 why link the two sic on the surface both have things in common both come from urban areas both are democrats and both are african americans
5505884 i enthusiastically pledge my support to senator barack obama who will bring much needed hope change and leadership to take our country in a new direction i will work hard to ensure he will be victorious in november
5505885 both come from sub urban areas both are republicans and both are caucasian americans
5505886 and it is truly an honor to be in the company of some of the best features in the industry
5505887 evan and i take doing our part in the industry seriously to make the web a safer place for children we really believe what we say in the psa it is not for appearances but we take it to heart
5505888 certain sects of our society and our government have the adult industry under a microscope using it as a scapegoat for all things unholy
5505889 we are so honored to have been approached by asacp and to be included in such an important message
5505890 stormy daniels is not only one of my peers but a friend and i am proud to stand along side her in the name of something as important as the rta label
5505891 internet service providers browsers filtering software and even computer operating systems such as microsofts vista offer parental control options but for those systems to work websites intended for adults only need to be labeled as such rta makes that possible
5505892 the adult entertainment industry is doing their part and we are thrilled that tera and evan have volunteered their time in order to remind parents to do their part by utilizing parental filtering options
5505893 so she oldest daughter had an argument with friends yeah your dad is gonna die said no hes not dying so she came and asked me are you dying i said well everybodys gonna die
5505894 you know i wanted to finish school to have more time with my girls but now time seems more precious

5505896 my oldest brother died in a car accident i dont want my parents to have to go through another son dying
5505897 i think were touched because their need arose out of something that was beyond their control

5505900 i have hope i have so much hope and i just know that ill miss him
5505901 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5505902 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5505903 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5505904 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5505905 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5505906 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5505907 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5505908 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny

5505911 the letting markets is being flooded by vendors who cannot sell their house with a view to getting a return for them
5505912 many of the properties coming into the letting market at present are homes which have either failed to sell or the owners have considered sale but opted to rent as they do not believe the house will sell
5505913 these homeowners should recognise that being a landlord comes with responsibilities and legal duties they have to make sure they are not in breach of their mortgage by renting the property moreover these reluctant landlords could easily come unstuck if they do not do their homework and become aware of things such as tenancy deposit protection tenant references gas and fire safety requirements
5505914 you are taking on substantial more debt than you planned by becoming an accidental landlord and the mortgage still needs to be paid whether you have tenants or not
5505915 customers who shopped for other items in your wish list also shopped for

5505921 thats something ive always really wanted to do go to the u n for and really you know not just go there for a safari but go there to actually help
5505922 if this isnt the last one ill bet there will only be one more
5505923 i think theyre so focused on the campaign they kinda lost the momentum
5505924 its about you know my love with spencer and just overdosing and being so happy in love and enjoying the moment
5505925 i couldnt do it because of the hills schedule but yeah they wrote a part for me and they wanted it to be a recurring role i went there and i auditioned they wanted to hire me and everything

5505928 we have a book on basque laws from the 1600s thats hand printed with beautiful scroll work and parchment type pages
5505929 part of our stewardship in building collections for the university of idaho library is recognizing the regional impact of certain parts of our holdings
5505930 were happy to have this collection and its a great example of cooperation between the two universities
5505931 only one or two libraries have some of these materials
5505932 we found basque dictionaries from the 1700s and 1800s these are interesting fairly unique books there is basque poetry and things that arent generally available thats why we wanted to bring the collection here to make many of the basque materials in the united states available
5505933 i think its really exciting because boise is such a unique place because of the basque community
5505934 tyranny of the test one year as a kaplan coach in the public schools
5505935 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5505936 today parliament has become sovereign we can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy

5505938 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5505939 theres no stable settlement these two guys sharif and zardari will now start slugging it out
5505940 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5505941 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5505942 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5505943 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5505944 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5505945 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar non believers with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5505946 the material in their possession promoted extreme ideology most notoriously of osama bin laden of al qaida as well as groups in various countries that adopted it
5505947 these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5505948 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5505949 we had no supplies no food and very little water
5505950 everywhere i go people have told me oh im getting nervous
5505951 the only thing about daughters is that when you hang out with them a lot and they get a cold somehow they end up passing it off to you
5505952 people thought big food group was dead now look at it woolworths is still a resonant brand with consumers and retailing is about getting the basics right it would be very tough to turn this business around as part of a public company and as part of a larger group it needs time out of the limelight
5505953 how much do woolworths have to give away for someone to take the problem off their hands
5505954 just over halfway through the beijing games and team gb has put in one of its best ever performances
5505955 in september our paralympians will i hope return from beijing having achieved similar success so to reflect the excitement and pride of the country in their superb victories weve set a date when we can cheer all our heroes and honour their extraordinary feats
5505956 this is a fitting tribute to the outstanding achievements of the whole team who have so far delivered team gbs most successful olympic games since 1920
5505957 gordon brown gave a commitment to deliver 100m a year to fund our athletes until the london games and we look to him to honour that commitment
5505958 100 per cent with us or 100 per cent against us
5505959 business was good when he was in charge the problems that we have now have all come under the civilian government
5505960 the armed forces have no intention to stay in charge longer than is absolutely necessary to pave the way for true democracy to flourish
5505961 everyone in task force helmand is affected by the death of a soldier and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family at this most difficult time
5505962 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5505963 while it is unclear exactly what caused their death an investigation is under way what is clear is that taliban fighters were in the area and showed a total disregard for the presence of civilians near them
5505964 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing
5505965 fred bowling around the wicket to a left hander is about as hard as it gets

5505968 this court is not convinced by evidentiary standard that respondents actions contributed to the problems with the cochlear implant p 5
5505969 the court finds that the respondent myself does not present a danger to the subject children and that it is in the best interests of the subject children to enjoy a relationship with their father p 6
5505970 petitioner sicko ex wife has been remarkable for her tenacity in using the court system to obtain what can only be perceived as her desire to extinguish the subject childrens relationships with their father p
5505971 the present relationship between the subject children and respondent is so strained as to require therapeutic supervised visitation
5505972 there was no clear proof of russian military involvement investigators have reportedly traced some of the data to russian servers tied to organized crime groups so the perpetrators may have been nationalists still the timing suggests that even if the responsible parties werent in uniform they coordinated their moves with the russian military
5505973 bush should be too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one said mohammed sayed said editor in chief of the egyptian independent daily al badeel u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq it is also widely noted in the middle east that washington stood by uncritically during israels military incursion into southern lebanon in its 2006 war with hezbollah
5505974 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty the tragic deaths of conor black in manchester and nilanthan murddi in croydon show why the action programme is so important

5505976 i will never forget the day the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said stephen was killed the night before something like that really does hit home one day he is enjoying life talking about doing an art a level and the next day he is gone

5505981 este equipo cuando se propone algo lo logra y cuando dijimos que bamos a ganar los tres partidos que quedaban lo hicimos porque est bamos convencidas de que lo pod amos hacer igual en los dos primeros encuentros no se hab a jugado mal

5505983 within b amp b there are less secure mortgages especially in self certification and the gmac portfolio i will need to address these issues in coming months
5505984 pym is a safe pair of hands in our view to try to shepherd b amp b through the coming asset quality problems we feel it will suffer however we also feel he can do little to avert said problems

5505991 they all should be on the table to be reviewed they need to be recalibrated were not seeking an adversarial relationship but we cant go on as normal at a minimum were looking at the high level meetings and whether that can go on
5505992 talks in the nato russia council are essential we need open lines of communication
5505993 this is really not about missile defence its really about poland and the czech republic
5505994 its really about geography the russians having a say about what poland and the czech republic are doing
5505995 since those devices are shipping in the fourth quarter the platform is now converging on a final android 1 0 version
5505996 apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature this might be a good time to take another look

5506022 they were in the water that was three to four feet deep the current is pretty strong in the middle of the river and they were not right in the middle but they couldnt get up on shore

5506039 four years ago the dragon was a reluctant presidential candidate
5506040 fans have asked if hell be running again but given the importance of the upcoming election it seemed appropriate that he would back barack obama the candidate whose politics most reflect his own savage dragon will be giving barack obama his full support

5506042 gobolinux tries to replace the legacy layout instead of going the way of stacked layouts giving us yet another standard layout as if its underlying reasons were superior than fhs i think theyre not
5506043 fhss goal is to allow apps to find their files and other apps files and libraries in a portable way among unix systems its a functional layout aimed at portability and interoperability
5506044 one huge problem of the fhs is that it does not easily allow one to have multiple versions of a program installed this is what has lead to the whole so 1 2 3 mess as well

5506053 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters

5506095 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5506096 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all

5506186 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
5506187 for 10 of the last 11 weeks weve sustained less than 200 attacks per week nationwide
5506188 it is undeniable that iraq is in a much better place than it was several months ago
5506189 an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
5506190 and as a result we have seen signs of hope and prosperity return to many parts of the country that were once previously threatened by criminal and terrorists and others who dont want iraq to achieve its full potential
5506191 were making progress in each of these areas every day
5506192 and while these efforts are progressing at a different pace they all are moving forward in a positive and tangible manner
5506193 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgia brigade
5506194 in the north al qaida is in disarray and its capability to conduct well planned and coordinated attacks is limited but they still pose a real threat to the population
5506195 and a couple of weeks ago i walked through an open market in mosul that was several kilometers long and it was overflowing with iraqis
5506196 now thats something that would not have been possible just a couple of months ago and this is a clear sign that we are making progress indeed
5506197 suicide vests which are a trademark of al qaida account for less than 3 percent of the total number of all of attacks but they account for 65 percent of all casualties
5506198 so you can see that while al qaida is in disarray they are still capable of ruthless attacks
5506199 as a result of the improved security in places like basra and amarah were seeing fewer numbers of lethal accelerants making their way into baghdad
5506200 today these militias are largely disrupted and ineffective because of iraqi operations and because the people have turned against them
5506201 absolutely impressed with the commitment and the professionalism of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines
5506202 their hard work continues to have a positive impact on the lives of the iraqis
5506203 theres still much work to be done but were making steady progress every day
5506204 theyre doing more and more for the kids and i noticed that the schools have been improving under their buildings and their teachers
5506205 it is sometimes difficult to attract candidates to urban districts because there are many challenges inner city districts face the result of dr durons tenure here speaks for themselves
5506206 we know because we see the data that our student achievement is improving in all areas in reading in math and in science we are doing well and were very proud of that
5506207 i would figure to say a superintendent especially in the north east independent school district over 75 000 maybe
5506208 we have the largest number of exemplary and recognized schools in bexar county and we have for the last three years
5506209 his leadership and his vision his knowledge of the past where we are in the present and where we need to go is quite frankly priceless
5506210 i think its a bad deal because my theory is that you need scientific evidence otherwise the town is going to have to spend 45 million they estimate
5506211 we continue to be adequately capitalized and we are committed to raising additional capital were financially sound and have strong liquidity
5506212 any capital that we do raise will depend on a variety of factors including prevailing market conditions

5506229 all the diversity that our church deals with is a constant source of creative challenge
5506230 i love the opportunity to serve in a wider context that our local church and the national and international invitations are a wonderful opportunity for me but my heart is never far from home
5506231 is all about worship that is truly god centred and how to find and develop the voice of our church in declaring that each church i know has a unique blend of people and preferences seeing how all that gets expressed in worship is an exciting journey

5506244 i learnt a lot academically but i also learnt a lot from the other people on the course theyd had different life experiences growing up where i grew up youre always very appreciative of what you get when i met these guys they were like well im going to be at the top it was a given that inspired me quite a lot so i started thinking about things like being the best you can be and how elitism fits into society

5506246 i thought i dont know if i can do this but ill give it a go and if im going to do it im going to change a few things and do it my way where pete was the visionary in terms of creating a project maybe the next phase of any project requires a different skill set to try and move it forward
5506247 i dont do documents to be honest i write very little i do a lot of talking and a lot of meetings but im notorious for writing very little and im not great with rules and stuff like that if i can see an opportunity like starting an academy i say lets go and do it someone might say im not sure you can spend lottery money like that i say lets spend it and argue about it afterwards
5506248 there were 18 gold medals available to cyclists in athens and 12 of them were on the track as a nation weve always been better at riding bikes in a straight line so it seemed to be an opportunity lets see what we can do if we go full time on the track get some early success there and build on that and see if we can expand into some of the slower burn projects and thats what weve done
5506249 its not going to be easy and if we have to leave it a year then so be it
5506250 the whole of this thing the bigger picture will improve the sport and improve where cycling stands lets see if we can impact on the health agenda with child obesity and so on its such a great sport and its so accessible that it would be nice to be able to capitalise on what weve done in a broader sense
5506251 my personal ambitions are allied to what i enjoy doing i wouldnt want to do something i dont enjoy i love cycling and i love the team ive got and i genuinely think were on to something in terms of achieving excellence in human beings
5506252 i dont think i particularly want to work in another sport really but i havent looked further than the end of the beijing games to be honest ill get back take stock and see where we go from there

5506305 estos no fueron hechos aislados no estamos ante una simple sumatoria de cr menes sino que se trat de un plan sistem tico de exterminio
5506306 todos aquellos que eran un obst culo para la estructura de pa s que la dictadura quiso imponer
5506307 no fueron cometidos de manera aislada sino que formaron parte de un plan de exterminio que ha quedado plenamente acreditado
5506308 se ores jueces tienen la responsabilidad hist rica de poner fin a esta prolongada impunidad
5506309 es necesario empezar a llamar a las cosas por su nombre y a los genocidas genocidas
5506310 venimos a solicitar un cambio de calificaci n y que se condene a etchecolatz por el delito de genocidio
5506311 no fueron hechos aislados no estamos ante una simple sumatoria de cr menes sino ante un plan sistem tico de exterminio
5506312 la dictadura describi tuvo como objetivo cambiar la estructura econ mica social y pol tica del pa s
5506313 el sector a exterminar estaba constituido por todos aquellos que eran un obst culo para esta estructura de pa s que la dictadura quer a imponer
5506314 el objetivo de la represi n no fue desaparecer gente solamente se necesitaba desaparecer gente para un proyecto de pa s es inimaginable que sin esas desapariciones hubiese avanzado como lo hicieron
5506315 necesitaban demonizar al sector que ser a reprimido y por eso se construy la figura del subversivo
5506316 se trat de la destrucci n sistem tica de aquellos que ten an ciertas formas de organizaci n y de participaci n pero no s lo se plane la aniquilaci n de una fuerza social sino tambi n la destrucci n de relaciones sociales en el conjunto de la sociedad
5506317 al conjunto de quienes desarrollaban pr cticas de articulaci n social de solidaridad en barrios centros de estudiantes o sindicatos
5506318 esta intencionalidad pol tica confirma que el imputado miguel osvaldo etchecolatz no es autor de una serie de delitos comunes
5506319 como parte del aparato del estado por eso constituye un genocidio
5506320 la prueba reunida no deja lugar a dudas respecto de la materialidad de los hechos sostuvo quedaron probadas las privaciones ilegales de la libertad las torturas el paso por los distintos centros clandestinos de detenci n los homicidios
5506321 dirig a y a la vez integraba los aparatos organizados de poder destinados a aniquilar personas estaba a cargo de los centros clandestinos pero tambi n los visitaba y participaba directamente en los secuestros y las torturas
5506322 cu l es el sentido de juzgar de forma aislada
5506323 el sujeto pasivo fue un grupo nacional constituido por m ltiples subgrupos unificados todos ellos por la calificaci n de el enemigo a exterminar
5506324 eran los j venes los obreros los estudiantes los extranjeros la clase trabajadora en su inmensa mayor a todos quienes declararon aqu fueron secuestrados cuando ten an entre 17 y 25 a os
5506325 en el circuito camps funcionaron al menos 29 centros clandestinos de detenci n todos bajo el mando del se or etchecolatz
5506326 el conocimiento cabal de todos los involucrados respecto de lo que estaba pasando en cada dependencia
5506327 es imposible que el personal policial estuviera en la dependencia ignorando lo que suced a con los detenidos desaparecidos a adi todos sab an lo que estaba pasando el jefe mandaba pero todos obedec an
5506328 hemos escuchado aqu de fusilamientos enterramientos como nn cuerpos al mar falsificaci n de instrumentos p blicos como actas de nacimiento o de defunci n falsos enfrentamientos
5506329 pero tambi n agreg hubo una estrategia de impunidad en tanto la libertad otorgada a los detenidos ilegales ten a condicionamientos que imped an por un lado su reinserci n en los mbitos sociales previos y por otro que pudieran denunciar masivamente lo que estaba ocurriendo
5506330 mayormente quienes han testimoniado aqu son sobrevivientes y familiares explic godoy la impunidad ha generado que durante 30 a os no hubo desde el estado quien quisiera escucharlos y convirtiera esos relatos en justicia y en este juicio los relatos exceden en demas a el grado de justicia que se puede alcanzar
5506331 es necesario en cada juicio oral reiterar declaraciones prestadas en sede judicial no una vez sino muchas una y otra vez deber n revivir las situaciones los compa eros de detenci n las torturas y los vej menes recordar rostros que no vieron porque estaban encapuchados nombres que no conocieron porque se manejaban con apodos
5506332 cu l es el sentido de juzgar a los responsables de un circuito represivo dependiente de la misma cadena de mandos un plan sistem tico de exterminio en forma aislada fraccionada donde el plan sistem tico se diluye empezando siempre desde cero y requiriendo cada vez que los sobrevivientes digan lo que vivieron y sufrieron
5506333 cuando se toma un solo elemento aislado de un relato plagado de cr menes se est banalizando el relato
5506334 en este caso la v ctima no es s lo el sobreviviente o el familiar es toda una sociedad que convive con la impunidad cuando los organismos decimos condena a todos los genocidas justicia por todos los compa eros no estamos haciendo consignismo estamos reclam ndole al estado que de una vez por todas repare en la m nima medida en que lo puede hacer 30 a os despu s la impunidad del genocidio que se llev a cabo en nuestro pa s
5506335 los il citos narrados por el modo especial de su comisi n por su escala volumen y gravedad cometidos desde el aparato del estado constituyeron fundamentalmente cr menes de lesa humanidad
5506336 configuran efectivamente el crimen de genocidio en tanto formaron parte de la ejecuci n de un plan criminal que tuvo por objeto perseguir y destruir a grupos humanos
5506337 que el castigo del crimen de genocidio es asunto de inter s internacional
5506338 deben ser castigados tanto los principales responsables como sus c mplices
5506339 surge con claridad que los procedimientos utilizados formaban parte de un plan sistem tico cuya finalidad consist a en la eliminaci n total de una categor a de la poblaci n denominada por los represores como subversivos
5506340 el grupo perseguido fue definido por su oposici n o incompatibilidad con el ideal que la dictadura militar se hab a propuesto dentro de los peculiares par metros con los que oper la represi n ilegal
5506341 teniendo en cuenta la colaboraci n que el acusado prest para tales fines es razonable concluir que conoc a y ejecutaba los il citos
5506342 no es una simple facultad del estado sino una obligaci n cuyo incumplimiento conlleva una grave violaci n a las obligaciones internacionales asumidas
5506343 este tribunal tiene tambi n la obligaci n como parte del estado de condenar como autor de genocidio a miguel osvaldo etchecolatz ya es hora y es oportuno para que las convenciones internacionales dejen de estar en la vidriera de la comunidad internacional y se apliquen en el territorio argentino
5506344 en primer lugar me quiero presentar como hija de desaparecidos mi mam mar a susana leiva y mi pap adri n bogliano fueron secuestrados y desaparecidos durante la ltima dictadura militar ac en la provincia de buenos aires es por eso que no puedo dejar de hablar tambi n en nombre de ellos y de los 30 mil compa eros detenidos desaparecidos
5506345 no puede caber otra pena para el imputado que la de reclusi n perpetua
5506346 ha quedado suficientemente acreditada la responsabilidad penal de miguel osvaldo etchecolatz en los casos aqu enjuiciados su rol preponderante y jer rquico en la brutal estructura represiva y su participaci n y autor a en los diversos hechos que hoy m s de 30 a os despu s podemos ver juzgados
5506347 se ores jueces ustedes tienen la responsabilidad hist rica de poner fin a la impunidad por tantos a os prolongada sostuvo estamos convencidos de que luego de tantos a os de b squeda infructuosa resulta imperioso comenzar de una vez por todas a llamar a las cosas por su nombre y a juzgar los hechos de acuerdo a su verdadera naturaleza al genocida genocida y al proceso judicial que lo investiga integrado unificado
5506348 estimamos que no basta una mera enunciaci n declamativa de esta circunstancia sino que exigimos un expreso reconocimiento jur dico de la existencia del genocidio

5506353 u s economy grows at solid pace in 2nd quarter
5506354 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
5506355 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate
5506356 while sometimes devastating these global relative price pressures are not the same thing as inflation
5506357 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases
5506358 as consumers spend more money for higher priced petroleum and agricultural goods they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services other relative prices must then fall
5506359 fingered exploding inflation as the biggest risk to the economy
5506360 products of public policies which deeply affect markets supply and demand consumers producers and speculators
5506361 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
5506362 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain
5506363 in asia particularly pakistan india indonesia south korea philippines nepal mongolia and china hundreds of millions of workers peasants artisans and low paid self employed workers as well as housewives and pensioners have engaged in sustained mass protests as they experience a decline in the quality and quantity of food purchases as prices skyrocket in africa hunger stalks the land and major food riots have occurred from egypt through sub saharan africa to south africa in the caribbean central and south america food riots have led to the overthrow of regimes mass protests road blockages from argentina bolivia through colombia venezuela and haiti

5506365 when i was serving a sentence on robben island during the struggle to end apartheid in south africa i never suspected that the end of white minority rule in my home country would be the beginning of yet another struggle for justice this time against the world bank and the international monetary fund
5506366 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
5506367 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
5506368 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
5506369 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model
5506370 given the reluctance of india and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices
5506371 the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival
5506372 we see many of the essential ingredients for a classic asset bubble said edward morse chief energy economist at lehman brothers morse estimated that 90 billion has flowed into the biggest commodity indices in just more than two years and more money has flowed into other exchanges pushing up prices
5506373 the cftcs economists are saying that supply and demand seem to be driving this but we have clients in the business that have experienced these markets for many many years and what im hearing from them is that they dont see any change in the fundamentals of supply and demand
5506374 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
5506375 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
5506376 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars
5506377 in 2000 congress decided that there were certain kinds of high end investors that were big enough and smart enough that they shouldnt be constrained to do all their business on the exchanges
5506378 public safety and preparedness agencies like the vermont state police corrections the national guard and veterans affairs will not be cut neither will debt service which the state must pay

5506383 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers
5506384 we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5506385 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5506386 and they did travel they used to move down to mildura they used to go out to moree they used to go all these areas doing the fruit picking doing the cotton chipping
5506387 the extension of the quarantining of welfare payments needs to be extended into the dole payments as well
5506388 i think it comes back to the general underperformance of the commodity currencies as the day went on and a little bit of an increase in risk aversion as reflected by the fall in the stock market particularly the financials mr rothfield said from san francisco
5506389 we believe that the concern in the market about the australian commodity story and the banking story has been overdone mr rothfield said
5506390 we think that the rebound in the us dollar in general has overshot

5506400 what do i love most about her collection those silver crown earrings one day they will be mine i also love the silver dipped four leaf clover and the silver star necklaces over all her collection has a clarity i enjoy her jewelry is unique yet simple with clean lines and a great use of colored gemstones i like the nautical influence as well as the geometric feel to the pieces theres also an organic feel i like a nature based element there great work
5506401 what do i have to do to make you see she cant love you like me why dont you stay im down on my knees im so tired of being lonely dont i give you what you need
5506402 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5506403 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5506404 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5506405 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5506406 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5506407 labours taxes and rising cost of living mean that pension increases for poor pensioners will be entirely eaten up by higher inflation
5506408 spend a much higher percentage of their income on high inflation goods like heating light and food
5506409 the truth is that gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made the country less fair browns labour means an unfair britain
5506410 this autumn we are going to step up the pressure to make sure that gordon browns obsession with his own short term survival does not do long term damage to britain that would not be fair
5506411 in 1997 the poorest pensioners lived on 69 a week today pension credit means no pensioner need live on less than 124 a week

5506413 one wanted to be fed and the other wanted me to mow the lawn with his little plastic lawnmower harrop said
5506414 but i saw most of it despite all the noise
5506415 i made a fair bit of noise myself what with crying and screaming
5506416 emmas gone her way and ive gone my way over the last six years we touch base whenever we can harrop said
5506417 but watching this olympic games brings a lot of emotions to the fore i see all the things emma is doing now and i wonder if luke was still here if hed be there too
5506418 certainly luke was part of her journey theres no doubt about that
5506419 but she has her own story to tell as well shes now engaged to craig walton and ive got two little kids but there will always be a bond between us
5506420 and i think that lukes death is part of what has kept her feet on the ground shes been through something like that and kept going
5506421 its such a weird place to be you dont really know where youre going when something like that happens said harrop who kept racing until the lead up to the 2006 commonwealth games when she retired after falling pregnant
5506422 theres a lot of decisions to make and its in the forefront of your mind how dangerous the sport
5506423 but emma would be thinking now it was all worth pushing through the hard times
5506424 the thing that did surprise me was the fact some of the girls didnt take it up to her a bit more harrop said
5506425 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5506426 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5506427 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5506428 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey
5506429 these things are a complete out of left field surprise
5506430 the ideal way is to figure out a way to puff them up to make them bigger without changing their mass
5506431 but its hard to come up with a model that can do that
5506432 there is no known process that can make that big an increase in size
5506433 the time you need in order to puff up galaxies by a factor of two or three is too long and these galaxies dont have the time
5506434 damn this has an odd sort of taste its not that great
5506435 why in the world did you eat those brownies if you didnt like them
5506436 i think were looking at the last generation of consoles theres not going to be an xbox 720 or a ps4 ill make that bet not going to happen
5506437 they compete in the number of weapons and unfortunately its easy for someone to compare this game to that game this game has 10 multiplayer levels but this one has 29 so clearly this game must be better
5506438 if you can imagine if movies competed in this way well sure schindlers list was good but i know this three and a half hour long movie think of the value youre getting for your ten dollars it doesnt work that way and unfortunately we still find ourselves competing this way we have to compete in quality not size
5506439 frustrated vendors have been placing their property in the market to let as they have been unable to agree sales due to a lack of demand in the housing market
5506440 many would be buyers have been forced to rent as the route to mortgage finance has been blocked
5506441 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term
5506442 however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5506443 a major factor in recent weeks is that many unsold houses are being withdrawn from sale and offered for rental instead
5506444 there is an oversupply of rental property in the market due to property owners unable to sell their properties attempting to let them
5506445 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers

5506449 the extension of the quarantining of welfare payments needs to be extended into the dole payments as well
5506450 we have to get people back into that mindset that their uncles and their grandparents and their parents had about working
5506451 hicham yezza an activist and writer was released without charge after six days in custody immediately rearrested on immigration charges and issued with a removal order to algeria after which he was held for a further 27 days he is still awaiting a conclusion to his deportation case
5506452 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5506453 we spent a few years going nowhere cruising about the 4min barrier then shane sutton came along and gave us a bit of a kick up the arse the two kids clancy and thomas came along and added impetus they dont seem to know what fear is they will lap it up until christmas
5506454 we deliberately tried to go under 4min twice on the same day which had never been done before and that instilled confidence in the youngsters like ed and gee
5506455 the most ridiculous drawn out process its really disorganised and very unprofessional very disappointing when you are competing at the highest level
5506456 obviously the controls are there for a good reason im glad they are there but they could be done better
5506457 the night of the keirin saturday i took two hours to get through the whole procedure didnt get to eat in the village until 11 30 at night and i had the sprint qualifying time trials the next morning at 9 oclock
5506458 he has as much power as a sprinter powerful but capable of riding short stage races the lap and a quarter he does from a standing start sets up the whole ride and he is still capable of a lap and a half flat out at the end

5506460 its not only physical with him mentally he is a warrior that guy could have been on the worst day of his life today and he would still have got up and done that ride he gets everything out of himself like rebecca romero he can dig deep

5506478 it seems like the writers strike ushered in a new era of nastiness in daytime while the rest of the entertainment industry shut down daytime as it has during every other strike kept going daytime writers were the only writers forced to choose between their union and their job the only ones with anything to gain by leaving the union if a couple of primetime writers went financial core nbc wouldnt have handed them heroes its only in daytime that writers are considered to be interchangeable and expendable

5506495 did you know that farmers get a subsidy to transport cows to those islands in the middle of the saint john river
5506496 its the only way they have of making sure this doesnt pass
5506497 don t add to packaging waste by grabbing up those mini soaps and shampoos
5506498 walk everywhere and explore local transportation instead of renting a car to get around if you must rent a car considering renting a hybrid or smart car
5506499 since insects are able naturally develop a resistance to the poisons used against them it seemed logical to think that they could be programmed from birth to be resistant
5506500 add to that a little bit of genetic rewiring to allow them to use the pesticides as their own weapon much like certain creatures do in the natural world and you increase the stakes
5506501 thrips are one of many parthenogenic creatures alive on the earth they can reproduce without the benefit of a mate normally this happens when something happens to the male population and the resulting births include a higher percentage of males to make up for it however my evil scientist decided to make the creatures give birth to only females and those females sensing the situation turned on their parthenogenetic buttons and produced more females in no time at all the island is nearly covered

5506503 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5506504 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5506505 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5506506 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5506507 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5506586 i miraculously recovered my mountain bike from the police station last week more than six weeks after it had been confiscated from some railings by trafalgar square in london i never expected to see it again and it was great to be reunited with it but im still none the wiser as to why it was taken in the first place and i am out of pocket to the tune of 40 having had to replace the lock that the police presumably destroyed the bike was taken at the start of april while i was at the theatre when i returned to pick up my wheels all that was left was a note informing me that any bikes left on the railings in question had been taken to belgravia police station but when i turned up to collect it two weeks later having been on holiday inthe meantime there was no record of any bicycles being picked up that night and no sign of it in belgravias bike graveyard underneath the station having taken all my details i was promised that my case would be passed on to the sergeant but three weeks later id heard nothing given that belgravia police station very rarely answers the phone i took to calling the metropolitan police press office who treated me with even greater contempt as a journalist who never writes about serious crime my calls to the met press office are always brushed off by some rude pr whose tone implies that i should stop wasting their time and let them get on with solving murders sure bike theft is not exactly on a par with terrorism or knife crime but that doesnt mean its irrelevant all i wanted to know was what law it is that gives the police the right to remove a locked bike from a public place but no one seemed to have the answer then as luck would have it my 143rd call to belgravia was answered by someone helpful he sounded genuinely concerned that there was no record of my bike and took it upon himself to find it half an hour later he rang back saying it had turned up in the bike graveyard without a saddle and thats how i finally found it the saddle was tossed on the floor somewhere over the other side of the car park but the bike was otherwise undamaged i guess ill never know what happened to it in those six weeks perhaps it was stolen by a policeman and then returned after i began to make enquiries or perhaps its been sitting in the back of some police van travelling the streets of london but i cant help wondering how many other people have run into similar police incompetence all those bikes in the graveyard must belong to someone yet some look like theyve been down there for years my best guess is that most of these bikes including mine were confiscated under the prevention of terrorism act which apparently gives the police the right to do what they like in the name of fighting terrorism ill be filing a complaint to the ipcc but i doubt theyll even bother to write back to me

5506600 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5506601 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5506602 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5506603 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5506604 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5506605 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5506606 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5506607 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us

5506619 when we took alone in the dark in 2001 it was to renew the franchise with names characters we tried to put it in a modern base and modernise it a little bit now i think that with this franchise if atari wants to do something further it has to be a major step towards other things perhaps other platforms other game systems other gameplay alone in the dark has this chance to have this fantastic title they have to work with that perhaps to be a little purer about it and move away from what has become the classical survival horror game with resident evil biohazard and let it be alone in the dark when you forget that theres been four or five instalments in the franchise you can do something fantastic with it

5506638 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5506639 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5506640 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5506641 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority

5506721 27 for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works
5506722 26 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
5506723 for what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul or what will a man give in exchange for his soul

5506729 the 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day 17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory 18 while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal
5506730 9 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished 10 but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities
5506731 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held 10 and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled
5506732 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them

5506735 3 when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained 4 what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him 5 for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour 6 thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet 7 all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field 8 the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas
5506736 21 envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith
5506737 12 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering 13 forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye 14 and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness 15 and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful
5506738 7 then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it
5506739 27 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
5506740 10 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad
5506741 7 to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life
5506742 26 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
5506743 18 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers 19 but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
5506744 19 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal 21 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
5506745 1 my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understanding 2 that thou mayest regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge 3 for the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil 4 but her end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a two edged sword 5 her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell 6 lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her ways are moveable that thou canst not know them 7 hear me now therefore o ye children and depart not from the words of my mouth 8 remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the door of her house 9 lest thou give thine honour unto others and thy years unto the cruel 10 lest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy labours be in the house of a stranger 11 and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed 12 and say how have i hated instruction and my heart despised reproof 13 and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me 14 i was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly
5506746 24 by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter
5506747 8 but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself
5506748 8 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ
5506749 18 let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
5506750 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life

5506857 13 when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am 14 and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets 15 he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am 16 and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god 17 and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven
5506858 17 and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven
5506859 5 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
5506860 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
5506861 2 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ
5506862 6 and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready 8 and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints 9 and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god
5506863 2 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
5506864 47 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
5506865 19 nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity
5506866 14 i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine
5506867 1 and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles
5506868 1 now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul
5506869 21 and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and antioch 22 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god 23 and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed
5506870 17 now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse 18 for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it
5506871 41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
5506872 16 salute one another with an holy kiss the churches of christ salute you
5506873 16 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste
5506874 6 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded 7 unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner 8 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
5506875 11 for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ
5506876 20 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone
5506877 18 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
5506878 6 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded
5506879 14 and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
5506880 16 and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god 17 and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven
5506881 19 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
5506882 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now 13 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come
5506883 you are the christ the son of the living god
5506884 18 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
5506885 20 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone
5506886 19 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
5506887 17 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams 18 and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy 19 and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke 20 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved 22 ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know 23 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain 24 whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it 25 for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved 26 therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope 27 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption 28 thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance 29 men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day 30 therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne 31 he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption 32 this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses 33 therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear 34 for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call 40 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation 41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
5506888 19 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
5506889 2 now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you
5506890 13 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe
5506891 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord
5506892 15 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle
5506893 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might 11 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand
5506894 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword 36 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter 37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us 38 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come 39 nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
5506895 9 after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands 10 and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb 11 and all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped god 12 saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto our god for ever and ever amen 13 and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they 14 and i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb 15 therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them 16 they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat 17 for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
5506896 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call 40 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation 41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
5506897 47 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
5506898 42 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
5506899 13 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe
5506900 13 but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth 14 whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ 15 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle
5506901 10 fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life
5506902 18 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
5506903 support for increased spending is greater in numerous program areas including education 73 health care 72 assistance to the poor 68 environmental protection 67 and social security 61
5506904 scientific research ranks about on a par with mass transit 38 and well ahead of space exploration 14 and assistance to foreign countries 10 in the proportion of the u s population favoring increased spending
5506905 to learn about specific scientific issues more than half of americans choose the internet as their main information source
5506906 the tone and content of your piece were exactly backwards
5506907 inject human dna into empty eggs from cows to create embryos known as cytoplasmic hybrids that are 99 9 per cent human in genetic terms
5506908 creating human animal hybrids could irrevocably harm the basic human genetic makeup and intentionally or unintentional change what it means to be human
5506909 what was once only science fiction is now becoming a reality and we need to ensure that experimentation and subsequent ramifications do not outpace ethical discussion and societal decisions history does not look kindly on those who violate the dignity of the human person the uks decision to allow the creation of human animal hybrids is short sighted and further underscores our need here at home to enact the common sense brownback landrieu human animal hybrid prohibition act
5506910 here in the united states we simply cannot open the door to the unethical blending of humans and animals which the british government seems intent on doing
5506911 it creates an unnatural species and is a clear line we cannot cross this unsound science also presents potential global health hazards due to increased risk of disease spreading to humans from animals
5506912 ordinary cells from an adult human can be used to make cloned embryos mature enough to produce stem cells the researchers said but because they havent produced those stem cells yet experts reacted coolly

5506914 the mouths trotters and tongues of the two piglets glow green under ultraviolet light which indicates the technology to breed transgenic pigs via cell nuclear transfer is mature
5506915 i have noted on many occasions that at present nasa funding levels our budget is sufficient to support a variety of excellent space programs but that it cannot support all of them balanced choices must be made but they cannot be continually remade if there is to be progress
5506916 those who are organizing this conference have long favored choices other than those put forth in the vision for space exploration and subsequently authorized by the congress their rejection of the moon as an important destination for mankind their emphasis on the early use of the lagrange points in a new space architecture and their advocacy for early missions to the near earth asteroids neo and to mars are well known and long standing these views were summarized in a report issued by the international academy of astronautics in july 2004 their opposition to the international space station continues unremitting one struggles to understand how the future international and commercial partnerships they advocate will come to pass if existing treaty level commitments are not kept
5506917 what is not mentioned in the aviation week article is that the questions to be raised at this conference have been asked and answered the organizers views and many others were amply considered and thoroughly debated in the two years that elapsed between president bushs announcement of the vision for space exploration in january 2004 and the strongly bipartisan ratification of the goals of the vision in the nasa authorization act of december 2005 as goes without saying nasa will execute the law of the land until and unless the congress provides new and different authorization for nasa the law of the land specifies that we will complete the international space station retire the shuttle design and build a new spaceflight architecture return to the moon in a manner supporting a sustained presence and prepare the way for mars
5506918 we are doing those things as quickly and efficiently as our appropriated funding allows system designs for the early elements have been completed contracts have been let and consistently solid progress is being made with a minimum of unexpected difficulty true the available budget is less than what was once promised and progress is therefore slower than all of us would prefer but applying resources in the right direction irrespective of pace is always productive and we are doing that ares and orion as they are presently taking form are the building blocks for any human future beyond low earth orbit leo
5506919 as i have often stated human missions to neos have no stronger advocate than i and i hope that a future congress will add such authorization to future guidance for nasa without altering other goals but in other respects i believe that the 2005 authorization act for nasa remains the finest policy framework for u s civil space activities that i have seen in forty years in particular i believe that to venture into deep space beyond the moon with what will be our first step beyond leo in more than fifty years whether to an asteroid or to mars is riskier than it needs to be returning to the moon and consolidating the gains to be made thereby is properly on the path toward neos and mars we should stay the present course as laid out in the act
5506920 the conference organizers have assigned sole responsibility for our new civil space exploration strategy to president bush ignoring the hugely bipartisan actually non partisan support it has received in congress in fact the principal features of the vision for space exploration and the subsequent 2005 authorization act are directly traceable to the recommendations of the columbia accident investigation board caib president bush acted on those recommendations in his proposal to congress no such far reaching proposal should be adopted without debate that debate was had in 2003 04 and 05 and it was fulsome from it came a unifying plan for civil space and the best legislative guidance nasa has ever had
5506921 no plan can fully satisfy all the many constituencies we have in what i wish were a true space community but as the caib noted it would be far worse to continue the prior multi decade lack of any strategic plan to continue dithering and debating and inevitably widening the gap between shuttle retirement and the availability of new systems the 2005 authorization act codifies a great strategic plan for civil space exploration now is the time for space advocacy groups to come together in support of it
5506922 we wish to make it clear that the purpose of the workshop is to examine critically the vision for space exploration in order to prepare for future space policy considerations in a new administration and new congress
5506923 we have deliberately included a wide range of participants with disparate views including those who would maintain the status quo we personally do not know what the conclusions of the workshop will be or even if there will be a definitive consensus
5506924 we must all hang together or assuredly we will all hang separately
5506925 in america for example where we have rising fuel costs and an aging population sales almost doubled to reach 10 000 in 2007

5506935 a lot of teams have looked at cleveland and looked the other way were usually the team that other teams have their highlights on but no more
5506936 ive seen a highlight reel of braylon edwards catching the ball and me running for touchdowns were not the team to look over anymore cleveland is in the house put us on prime time and lets see what we can do
5506937 we havent been on monday night for the five years since ive been here its a big stage for us to play on and its good to see where we are against the world champions especially the starters and first teamers
5506938 they have a really good offense with eli a big back in brandon jacobs 6 4 264 and good receivers
5506939 youre supposed to use preseason games to knock the cobwebs out last game we could have done better with our angles to the ball we cant be looking in the backfield while guys are running past us

5506944 you could see on braylons td catch vs the jets and some of the plays donte had theyre fun to throw to they make it easy on quarterbacks
5506945 with a guy like edwards youve got a wide margin of error where you can put the ball hopefully ill have the opportunity to work with them maybe next game or sometime soon
5506946 this will give the guys a chance to get their minds right while theyre in the hotel and focus on the game
5506947 itll help with the distractions that come with a monday night game as far as pregame and tickets and interviews and stuff like that even though all that stuff is part of the game you have to stay focused

5506958 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5506959 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

5506977 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15
5506978 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5506979 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth

5507247 it is nice for practice but you worry about september when its going to be 100 degrees and humid
5507248 we need more heat and humidity and need to work a little harder
5507249 it was good getting in and having the time this morning with the players to go over the video of the scrimmage
5507250 we did a lot of good things we made a lot of good individual plays and we just need to get better as a unit as an offense and defense the way you do that is all 11 guys do their job on a given play and with great effort
5507251 i think that we threw and caught the ball well
5507252 we were accurate throwing the ball and we didnt have drops we made catches and made plays thats something that we keep talking to them about is the consistency and how contagious that can be
5507253 we just need to have our poise and keep working hard
5507254 keep believing in what we are doing and you know eventually all 11 guys will do their job at the same time and well be good on defense we just need to keep improving
5507255 one thing about the defensive line is that scrimmages are probably hardest on them than anybody else what you would like to do is have eight guys that you can rotate in and keep fresh when you go one and twos you have to go every rep so its a little bit more difficult for them
5507256 a great storm puts out a little fire but it feeds a strong one
5507257 creativity is not like a freight train going down the tracks
5507258 its something that has to be caressed and treated with a great deal of respect if your mind is intellectually in the way it will stop you youve got to programme your brain not to think too much

5507293 the cow she thinks shes a dog so shes interested in everything
5507294 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5507295 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5507296 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5507297 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5507298 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5507299 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5507300 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5507301 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5507302 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5507303 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5507304 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5507305 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5507306 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5507307 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5507308 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5507309 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5507310 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5507311 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5507312 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5507313 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5507314 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5507315 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5507316 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5507317 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5507318 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5507319 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5507320 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5507321 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5507322 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5507323 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5507324 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5507325 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5507326 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5507327 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5507328 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5507329 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5507330 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5507331 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5507332 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5507333 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5507334 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5507335 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

5507535 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5507536 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5507537 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5507538 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5507539 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5507540 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5507541 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5507542 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5507543 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5507544 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5507545 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5507546 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5507547 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5507548 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5507549 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5507550 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5507551 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5507552 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5507553 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5507554 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5507555 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5507556 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5507557 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5507558 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5507559 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5507560 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5507561 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5507562 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5507563 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5507564 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5507565 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5507566 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5507567 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5507568 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5507569 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5507570 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5507571 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5507572 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5507573 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5507574 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5507575 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5507576 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5507577 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5507578 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5507579 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5507580 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5507581 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5507659 we recently redefined the series with resident evil 4 in which the camera is repositioned behind the hero and elevated the action and intensity of the gameplay even if the gameplay of resident evil 4 remains up to my taste wed clearly love to exploit the potential of the nintendo revolution controller to prevent players tiring of this style of gameplay

5507664 video games are hot holiday items and there are certainly wonderful games that help our children learn and increase hand and eye coordination

5507676 just being there and seeing the windows blown out and the garage doors blown off and the roofs torn away just through the grace of god this happened at 4 oclock in the morning

5507682 we could do a little bit more ourselves it seems like whenever someone makes a mistake the cry goes up oh the footballers are out of order again it is tough and you have to remember that young footballers get thrown into the spotlight at an age when they have little life experience
5507683 when you step on to that football pitch it isnt about money it is about pride in your performance
5507684 it is like any other sport it shouldnt be about how much you get paid but how much desire you show if you win it doesnt matter what other sports do
5507685 if we were to win all 10 of our qualification games people would immediately start talking about us winning the world cup
5507686 six televised debates with each covering the broad range of issues important to the voters of congressional district 3
5507687 we agree there should be some debates prior to early voting but in fairness to all of the voters in the district there should be others after early voting starts
5507688 the people of the district need to be able to make an informed decision about our congressional race
5507689 thats why im officially requesting a debate between you and me on energy the debate needs to be scheduled in the next week before the democratic and republican national conventions and before you go back to washington to resume your duties
5507690 congresswoman giffords looks forward to addressing energy and other important issues that face the citizens of southern arizona during the already scheduled debates that have been agreed upon by the campaigns
5507691 i think that puts giffords back into a little more safe territory shes in really good shape there it comes down to name recognition and yes well tim bee was senate president but i think her name is going to go a lot further
5507692 nosotros aceptamos esta positiva idea porque el valor de la solidaridad hace bastante tiempo que lo estamos promoviendo le da identidad a nuestro pa s y que quisi ramos profundizar vamos a estudiar esta proposici n y nos hemos puesto de acuerdo que el mejor camino ser a presentar un proyecto de ley para que los parlamentarios realmente lo convirtieran en una ley que diera respaldo a este premio y esperamos que tenga el apoyo un nime queremos que el valor de la solidaridad sea parte sustantiva de nuestra cultura
5507693 yo soy el vocero de un mont n de organizaciones solidarias que estamos detr s de esta idea porque nos parece que la solidaridad es un valor nacional que tenemos que cultivar que cuidar y con este reconocimiento es que podemos fomentar en todos los chilenos y chilenas este valor que es tan importante en la vida

5507701 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
5507702 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
5507703 i see barack obama as kind of the thoughtful consensus builder i see john mccain as the happy straightforward warrior and they both answered exactly according to casting
5507704 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5507705 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5507706 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5507707 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5507708 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5507709 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5507710 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5507711 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5507712 hes a man of few words but when he tells stories he connects
5507713 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5507714 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5507715 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5507716 one of the most if not the most important issue for many social conservatives
5507717 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5507718 i thought i was going to be a fashion designer
5507719 so how are you guys doing how much did you do at your warehouse sale
5507720 why are all of your designs so negative and about suicide
5507721 the view is that they would like everything to be settled before the deployment and our view is that we should proceed immediately with the monitors
5507722 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5507723 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5507724 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5507725 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5507726 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5507727 selling our innocent brothers and sisters to america for dollars
5507728 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order

5507895 as we approach the 2008 general election the structure of elections in the united states once reliant on local representatives accountable to the public has become almost wholly dependent on large corporations which are not accountable to the public most local officials charged with running elections are now unable to administer elections without the equipment services and trade secret software of a small number of corporations if the vendors withdrew their support for elections now our election structure would collapse however some states and localities are recognizing the threat that vendor dependency poses to elections they are using ingenuity and determination to begin reversing the direction

5507897 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5507898 this is a planning took where all things are going
5507899 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5507900 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5507901 the reason is a result of increasing costs including rising fuel prices and a substantial increase in the cost of newsprint
5507902 vodafone has seen significant growth in mobile broadband over the past 12 months and expects it will continue to be a popular alternative to fixed line adsl
5507903 the applied for mark merely describes a feature and characteristic of applicants services
5507904 incapable of functioning as a source identifier for applicants services
5507905 the big issue with energy star is that only 25 per cent of it departments even pay their energy bills so purchasing decisions are often made purely on the cost of the device
5507906 if its somewhere else its better i dont know why
5507907 the issue in australia is you can only go so far you have to look at how to sell your product on an international stage
5507908 we had a number of customers in australia all tier two
5507909 we looked at the united states but came to the conclusion that its still difficult to get into and not necessarily the most rewarding
5507910 dont necessarily assume its the pot of gold it appears from the outside the prices arent as good because there is more competition
5507911 theres only one word for the u s market and thats brutal
5507912 but a lot of your competition starts here and if a product is going to make it in the long run with a few exceptions youve got to make it in business here
5507913 mostly were hoping to gather women in roughly the same timezone together
5507914 and wed also like to make sure the most active volunteers from both chapters are in regular contact as we have one major joint event each year the linuxchix miniconference at linux conf au and members of each chapter not infrequently visit the other country on business
5507915 im very pleased with the increased numbers of women in open source in recent years and with them has come an increased sense of women in open source being a normal thing
5507916 i hope more linux and open source women users are welcomed into the development and advocacy communities it is also an increasingly good source of it skills and employment and i want more women to take advantage of that

5507983 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5507984 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5507985 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5507986 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5507987 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5507988 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

5507990 president vladimir putin said friday he had ordered strategic bombers to resume regular long range patrols as russian and chinese forces held their first joint military exercise on russian soil a show of armed muscle aimed at sending a pointed message to the united states the resumption of bombing patrols which analysts say signaled a significant change for russian military policy comes amid a growing chill in u s russian relations strained over washingtons criticism of russias democracy record moscows objections to u s missile defense plans and differences over global crises

5507994 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5507995 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5507996 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5507997 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5507998 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5507999 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5508000 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5508001 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5508002 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5508003 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5508004 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5508005 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5508006 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5508007 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5508008 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5508009 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5508010 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

5508078 dijo a mar a m sica se la cagaron a palos todos los medios y la sociedad por algo mucho menor y esto apenas se cubre estamos p simo con los valores dados vuelta
5508079 naturally im thrilled that louis and jordan will be with us this season because they are outstanding young men who will be vital to our teams success
5508080 they will continue to pursue their educations and represent lsu in a first class manner
5508081 at the same time its important that we remain committed to enhancing their opportunities to pursue professional baseball careers at the end of their senior years
5508082 we have a talented group of 10 freshmen including the four that were drafted
5508083 they delayed their entrances into pro ball to get great educations and win championships for lsu as with louis and jordan its our responsibility as a program to put the young players into the best possible positions to pursue pro baseball careers when they again become draft eligible
5508084 this is really neat theres nothing like it where we live and weve never seen anything like this geared to children
5508085 noah loved playing in the sand and water he loved the drums and pipes and xylophones
5508086 im astounded at how everything has grown we came here when it was new
5508087 i cant believe how gigantic these plants have become its like going to a rain forest
5508088 just to see the kids faces when they find hidden treasures
5508089 i personally have been a part of gospel music in dayton for 38 years
5508090 ive broadcast all varieties of gospel music i played southern gospel one part of the day and traditional gospel the other part ive also had a chance to work with and produce local and national artists ive listened to all types of gospel music and have been very blessed to have that exposure
5508091 lee williams falls in the category of traditional quartet style gospel
5508092 hes one of the few artists in america who commands ones attention from the stage they dont run up and down the aisles they dont jump the pews they stand there and spread the word
5508093 i was speaking with dottie peebles and some other big names in gospel and they were saying theyve done concerts with lee williams they leave the stage sweating after performing and they get a little scattered but when lee williams hits the stage everybody runs back inside
5508094 the decline in demand for the products that it sells resulting from the general housing slowdown and credit crisis
5508095 i think you just have to keep doing the same kinds of things youve been doing
5508096 you cant try to make it bigger than it is its a good opportunity and hopefully i can perform well and we can perform well as a team i dont think you can try to make it more than it is
5508097 as a quarterback you have to understand that youre going to make some mistakes but you have to minimize them and you have to get over them
5508098 you cant kind of dwell on those things you try and learn from them and so i looked at it today and youve got to throw that behind you and get ready for this week
5508099 we took him off the 5 yard line and he took them 11 plays and i thought he was very efficient at moving the team
5508100 he had a throw that wed like to have back but again its a learning curve for matt
5508101 the positive is that when things went bad matt kept his head up
5508102 he was into the game the real sign is going to be how when he comes back and has the opportunity to play next week when his number gets called
5508103 thats exciting to get out there and to be able to go right away
5508104 it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties
5508105 consistent commitment to the cause of the publics right to know what its government is doing as she has demonstrated throughout her career in words and actions
5508106 channel 7 had a very deliberate strategy with the yum cha program and that was to dumb it down in order to make it digestible for non sporting viewers
5508107 everything on that program was scripted and sonia has executed the strategy exactly how seven wanted it to play out
5508108 i dont want the world to see me cause i dont think that theyd understand
5508109 go on take everything take everything i want you to
5508110 they get what they want amp they never want it again
5508111 all things work together for good to them that love god
5508112 hvor der ulykkeligvis er mange tegn p racisme der bekymrer os og som ikke kan skjules siger pr sten
5508113 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5508114 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5508115 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5508116 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5508117 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5508118 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5508119 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5508120 1 at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven 2 and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them 3 and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven 4 whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven 5 and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me 6 but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea 7 woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh 8 wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire 9 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire 10 take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven 11 for the son of man is come to save that which was lost 12 how think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray 13 and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray 14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
5508121 you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven
5508122 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ
5508123 12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling 13 for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure
5508124 4 whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
5508125 3 let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves 4 look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
5508126 5 and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me 6 but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea 7 woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh
5508127 39 and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth 40 and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entereth in where the damsel was lying 41 and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise 42 and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of twelve years and they were astonished with a great astonishment
5508128 6 but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
5508129 7 woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh
5508130 5 and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me
5508131 4 and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me 5 and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
5508132 9 but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak 10 for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols 11 and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died 12 but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ 13 wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend
5508133 8 wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire 9 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
5508134 everlasting 41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
5508135 46 and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal
5508136 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
5508137 10 take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven 11 for the son of man is come to save that which was lost 12 how think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray 13 and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray 14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
5508138 ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation
5508139 14 are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation
5508140 11 for the son of man is come to save that which was lost
5508141 14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
5508142 its not the green light its the red light that bothers me

5508145 i know an important thing for my father and for myself is that id be able to tell my sisters children what happened to their mom
5508146 and that no she didnt abandon you and leave you
5508147 we just knew from the beginning that there was some kind of foul play
5508148 but it makes sense that she would still be locally near the area and basically hidden in plain sight
5508149 the reason for doing that is theyre trying to go ahead and build a network of who the individual knew so they can start questioning them to see what might have been a potential motive and what direction they might need to go in

5508154 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5508155 but if you dont believe in god then you cant possibly have any morals
5508156 becoming a green or a socialist or an anarchist is a value judgement a subjective decision that for example to discriminate on the basis of skin colour or religious denomination does not just cause the victims hurt and has a knock on effect in our ability to unite together but is out and out wrong and has to stop its a bad thing regardless of rationalisations
5508157 morals can get you killed make you famous blow up bridges and enslave millions in dead end jobs of impoverishment and hurt what could be more real than that
5508158 the hope is so high that it will have some effect that everybodys asking for it
5508159 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5508160 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5508161 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5508162 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5508163 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

5508169 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5508170 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5508171 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5508172 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5508173 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5508174 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5508175 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5508176 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5508177 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5508178 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5508179 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5508180 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5508181 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5508182 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5508183 lo que hace el macho es seducir a la hembra con un clase de sonidos muy particulares
5508184 in our view this should be a significant positive catalyst in the current environment
5508185 assuming guidance is reasonably consistent with market forecasts we would expect the share price to meander around current levels
5508186 we do not believe the current share price is factoring in a soft outlook for 2009
5508187 there is enough research evidence in retail to suggest that a certain degree of chemistry exists between the sexes
5508188 the man woman chemistry is 100 with romantic love 16 in work environment where there is no romantic involvement 31 between a boss and a subbordinate of the opposite sex in a buying selling environment this chemistry between the sexes is about 8
5508189 this is apparent from the fact that people are prone to listen longer and feel more excited about the product and purchase more if its a member of the opposite sex they are relating to this is why in many retail chains across the globe its a sales person from the oppsite sex who walks up to serve the customer and this is applicable to any customer aged between 14 and 80
5508190 the man that vowed to stop using the unique affiliate marketing method because it never made him rich like the gurus promised decides to give goads affiliate payload a chance was it worth it
5508191 but why do i loathe affiliate marketing so much that i dont usually use it
5508192 as great as this item sounds with the great features decent copy and its supposed easy money generating techniques its probably not worth it
5508193 so here came the final question did i make or break with affiliate payload the results are in
5508194 most of the people that are about to use affiliate payload are going to have questions
5508195 it took me some serious consideration but i came up with a way this will work im going to help guide you and answer any questions you have while fortifying all the things
5508196 just the other day i bought alex goads aff payload from a link on your site

5508199 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5508200 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5508201 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5508204 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5508205 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5508206 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5508207 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5508208 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5508209 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5508210 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5508211 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5508212 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5508213 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5508214 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5508215 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5508216 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5508217 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5508218 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5508231 the department has claimed to have sent out more than 2000 letters to landholders advising them of this survey but these so called letters dont seem to have reached many people in the liverpool plains
5508232 i was advised by numerous landholders last thursday in the region that helicopters have been landing on their property
5508233 obviously something went wrong with that mail out because those letters werent received
5508234 theyve got to talk to the landholders before any more activity takes place
5508235 we endeavoured to get the best mailing list we could and our database came from the department of lands
5508236 we had to cut that database down because there were duplicates of landholders who own multiple lots
5508237 it was addressed to the landholder and didnt specify dates or times when a landholder might expect a helicopter to land on their property for the purposes of this survey
5508238 between 100 and 200 people have signed a statement of support and lots of people have stopped as theyre walking past or driven by to let the guys know theyre with them
5508239 everyones okay and they realise its something that isnt going to be resolved overnight
5508240 we walcha council havent been able to get any comment of them so far attempts this morning were unsuccessful
5508241 however the guys remain in good spirit and are reasonably optimistic
5508242 we had to draw a line in the sand somewhere and weve done that now
5508243 we do hope boral makes a response sooner rather than later and we will be trying to contact boral again tomorrow
5508244 negotiations are taking place and the ball is now firmly in borals court
5508245 we have reached a stage where boral needs to make known its intentions for the mill and whether it can be leased or sold if not reopened
5508246 if we dont get those responses the campaign will escalate
5508247 at this stage forests nsw is holding timber that would normally have been processed at walcha in the field at harvesting sites while the future of the mill is determined
5508248 it would appear the list is about 14 months old
5508249 council has received coupon payments since investment of these funds of 156 206 up to june 30 2008
5508250 what we have done is to engage piper alderman a legal firm representing the wingecarribee council which is understood to be taking legal action for advice on our situation and options
5508251 we have certainly not made a decision to participate in a class action at this point

5508265 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5508266 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5508267 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5508268 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5508269 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5508270 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5508271 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5508272 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5508273 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5508274 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5508275 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5508276 aside from economic benefits we can see that a park like this would also provide ecological social cultural benefits

5508281 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5508282 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5508283 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5508284 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5508285 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5508286 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5508287 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5508288 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5508289 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5508290 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5508291 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5508292 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5508293 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5508294 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5508295 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5508296 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5508297 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5508298 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5508299 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5508300 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

5508302 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5508303 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5508304 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5508305 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5508306 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5508307 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5508326 i don t like the union because they are only concerned with growing membership making money and causing problems the union used to be important but most of us now feel we have enough protections from government and employers
5508327 this would undo 30 years of thoughtful and effective regulation of elections that balances the needs of workers employers and unions
5508328 for all its ramifications it is astounding that this bill only appeared in the final month of the legislature s two year session and will not be vetted in serious public policy committee hearings
5508329 it is all about the ufw exploiting tragedy to tip the election process in their favor because it has failed to deliver value to farm workers

5508389 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of s closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5508390 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5508391 mccain views this as the one decision that he has total utter non negotiable control over

5508399 they gave their ranch and texas white house to the people so they could see where so many things happened during the term of the president
5508400 its one thing to talk about those things its another to be able to take people through the front yard and ranch and office where so many things happened
5508401 he was the first president who had the technology to have a remote white house
5508402 i had a great experience at nc state it was a special place for me over the last two and a half years the entire coaching staff and the support staff have been great to me

5508406 all the leases are up on the 31st so everyone is basically moving all their stuff out and then getting ready to move into the houses
5508407 all the sidewalks are filled with boxes like huge piles and theres furniture old and new theyll be broken couches and chairs its a mess
5508408 sometimes it seems the thieves know exactly where and what to steal and its because people advertise
5508409 i know personally quite a few people whove been burglarized around here and i guess i didnt even think of the boxes throwing it away like that but it makes sense easy target then
5508410 oft times people will come into the apartment building and theyll steal people blindly
5508411 its kind of unfair were kind of vulnerable at that point its a new surrounding everybodys moving in and out so theyre not locking the doors yet

5508415 its fine for parents to bring their children to school and to take pictures we encourage parents not to get too uptight about it make sure that the youngsters are settled parents would be surprised if they saw how quickly their children adjust
5508416 they learn lots of songs we sing about colors and numbers and we learn nursery rhymes

5508425 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs

5508427 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5508428 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics

5508430 the storm s not a concern it just doesn t look like it s going to do a lot of damage
5508431 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5508432 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5508433 randomized blinded placebo controlled clinical trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5508434 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data

5508449 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5508450 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5508451 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5508452 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5508458 the population in phoenix is a little bit younger than the average for the rest of the nation as well as for the west region
5508459 since seniors tend to have lower incomes than those age groups still in the labor force the amount they spend on most items is less however in two categories seniors tend to spend a larger dollar amount than persons who are younger those are health care and cash contributions
5508460 consumer surveys show that persons 65 and over contribute much higher close to 40 percent higher amounts to others including charity organizations and other persons
5508461 senior spending percentage on health care is about three times greater than the average this is the major item that is different
5508462 the sub categories that drive up senior health spending are insurance older persons pay more and drugs and medications as age increases spending on drugs increases
5508463 it seems like phoenix residents do enjoy their food and drink relative to their national counterparts and of course theres the hot desert weather
5508464 phoenix residents are spending a smaller share of their budget on housing and perhaps that frees them up to spend a little more money on food and drink and taking care of themselves and going out
5508465 seniors spend just slightly lower percentage of income on entertainment but spend twice as much as the average on reading materials
5508466 it has a lot to do with the types of vehicles that people are buying
5508467 phoenix residents perhaps enjoy finer better vehicles than people in the rest of the country in terms of their typical spending the part of their budget that goes to paying for vehicles is quite a bit higher than the rest of the nation
5508468 the share spent for transportation is higher and of course thats because weve developed as an automobile oriented economy here and you dont have to live in phoenix long to come to appreciate that and understand it
5508469 we spend more on food away from home and thats probably characteristic of the modern younger family where you have two people working and thats just kind of a condition of modern life
5508470 i am surprised to see phoenix has the same number of vehicles per person as the national average
5508471 it seems like theres a lot of vehicles out there
5508472 these things are a complete out of left field surprise
5508473 the ideal way is to figure out a way to puff them up to make them bigger without changing their mass

5508544 the lack of an unambiguous population policy reflects a lack of seriousness in promoting long term economic growth and poverty reduction
5508545 the catholic church knows how to mobilize its members not to vote for anti life politicians
5508546 some priests and some lay ministers were calling me an abortionist they were calling me a worker of satan
5508547 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5508548 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5508549 theres a bus in a difficult situation which crews have had to secure and obviously the crews are working very hard in difficult circumstances
5508550 i heard this massive crash rumble of either crunching metal or what sounded to me initially as a thunderstorm as it was heavily raining before
5508551 then after that we heard shouts and screams so we obviously put it down to a crash
5508552 when i got to the scene there was a bus overturned it looked like it had ploughed into a car and then down a neighbours driveway into the garden
5508553 it must have dropped about 20ft it was on a slope its diagonal not head first
5508554 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus there were many walking wounded all being seen to by the ambulance staff
5508555 i went to the front door and there was there was about 12 to 15 people all crying hysterically blood running down their faces and their arms and they couldnt speak english but they were able to say
5508556 its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour of rain just before it happened
5508557 i was in the local pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets
5508558 we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police
5508559 everything you see today every single aspect of terrorism you can see it in the russia of a century ago
5508560 this was old time traditional terrorism targeting people very carefully assassinating people who were senior members of the government people who affected policy
5508561 but then they basically killed whoever they could attack and very often there was no connection anyone who wore a uniform became a target being a mailman was a very dangerous occupation for example
5508562 the violence descended into indiscriminate killing they were no longer attacking people in uniform but anyone who looked bourgeois if you had glasses or a watch or an umbrella then obviously you were too rich to be a proletarian that is where the descent into sheer terror begins
5508563 they would blow up train stations they would blow up caf s
5508564 one such bombing was justified with the remark we just wanted to see how the bourgeois squirm in death
5508565 some were honest enough to say who the hell cares about ideology
5508566 but they dont know anything about the russian precedent people have no clue that the origins of the war on terrorism are in russia
5508567 whenever i hear someone suggest that hamas might become a more responsible movement now that it is in charge i think why dont you read a little about the bolsheviks and see if you still believe that
5508568 you want to know what happens when terrorists come to power as soon as terrorists come to power they begin building on what they did to get there look at the bolsheviks who were terrorists before they came to power in 1917 they used this terror based revolution to build a terror based state
5508569 no way that hamas will turn away from terrorism no way they will remain an organization committed to terror
5508570 and the first victims of hamas rule will not be the israelis but the palestinians themselves just as the the bolsheviks primary victims were not the poles nor the czechs nor the americans nor anyone else but the russians and the ukrainians
5508571 i think we suffer i think the whole world now suffers from a collective stockholm syndrome
5508572 our problem is that we so want to believe in the goodness of people that we cant see how bad some people are there are people who dont want to call these people terrorists well you can call them pussycats if you want but theyre not going to stop killing
5508573 they often fire their rockets in the morning as children are going to school and in the afternoon as they are on their way home from school
5508574 as jews we have an obligation to choose life and to defend it otherwise
5508575 one of the basic characteristics of violence in culture is that it is like a living organism in that it is mobile and it must remain in motion in order to survive
5508576 so long as the violence is directed externally it can maintain its momentum but once it is prevented from that goal if you wall it off it cant stop like any organism it must keep moving so the violence turns on its originators consider the nazis when they could no longer kill others they killed themselves

5508583 the u s has absorbed a record number of immigrants since 1990 mainly from latin america asia and africa the country is now home to about 38 million legal immigrants and 12 million undocumented immigrants an additional 31 million people are children of immigrants
5508584 our review of economic research finds immigrants not only help fuel the nations economic growth but also have an overall positive effect on the income of native born workers
5508585 immigration produces substantial economic benefits for the united states as a whole
5508586 by focusing on the economic costs and benefits of legal and illegal immigration stemming illegal immigration would likely lead to a net drain on the u s economy a finding that calls into question many of the proposals to increase funding for border protection

5508589 yeah i like those they would make my butt look big
5508590 eh nothing formal but there are a few girls that have become interested in me
5508591 there are many things that make this so difficult to be honest after the last two relationships fell apart when they should have flourished i became disheartened mom i am tired what i had with jessy was important to me and without reason contrary to the very last thing that was said to me everything was broken off instantly i just hope she rejected me i hope nothing bad has happened to her because that would hurt far more
5508592 you deserve more than what you got this was the girl from iowa
5508593 yeah she is living in iowa i know that we have had this discussion before but i assure you we do not deserve anything i do not deserve anything the way that i see it if all good things are given to us as gifts and we are created beings then our creator is not held subject to that which he created if he has the sole discretion to give to us as he sees fit then there is nothing that i deserve understand though that this is on the cusp of holding conversations with several people who are closest to me that would argue and have argued fervently against me on this issue but i remain unwavering in this position because i have never felt as certain of much else it is the beginning of humility to understand that the self must be ignored and expelled
5508594 have you thought about going to a singles function or using a website to focus on a type of woman
5508595 yes but a large portion of the problem is that people are dying emotionally even among christian women there is the problem of the self and the lack of emotions we are able to reach each other more and more these days however we are more distant than ever each person is isolated in their minds and hearts and each are convinced that they deserve something better removing the capacity or desire to forgive the one who transgresses against them beyond that i am struggling with the time that is wasted in relationships in the last i formed a relationship with not just a single person but rather with two people when the break up occurred between the two of us mom i had more to lose and i lost a lot which is why there is a lot of pain associated with the whole thing i am tired of trying so hard to simply lose everything
5508596 all i ever wanted for my birthday was a sappy hallmark card but he never gave me one not one he couldnt

5508681 two foster homes for 3 of the largest counties in the state is unacceptable
5508682 it takes hours to drive the children to have visits with their parents all that time on the road is hard on young children not to mention the workers spending time behind the wheel and out of the office the time driving could be spent reconnecting this is a real roadblock to reunification
5508683 because of the low number of foster homes were forced to place children in other counties
5508684 weve even placed children as far away as poteau thats more than 450 miles from guymon this makes reunification even more challenging not to mention the stress on the children being moved away from their schools churches friends and homes
5508685 there are folks who may have their daycare in texas doctor in colorado and dentist in new mexico or go to wal mart in kansas and its hard to find medical services for some folks services in other states are closer than those in oklahoma and for us that presents a whole new set of challenges
5508686 the panhandle has a rural sparse population but there is a strong sense of community and a willingness to help its just a challenge to communicate the need for quality foster homes but if folks find out we know theyll step up and help
5508687 we need to make sure agriculture is well represented in any discussion about water
5508688 this is important because were talking about the future management of oklahomas water resources
5508689 its a simple fact that without water we cannot produce food so farmers and ranchers need to be in the front row at these meetings

5508714 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers
5508715 we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5508716 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5508717 and they did travel they used to move down to mildura they used to go out to moree they used to go all these areas doing the fruit picking doing the cotton chipping
5508718 the extension of the quarantining of welfare payments needs to be extended into the dole payments as well
5508719 this dredging will simply put the area under too much stress and the environmental damage will be extensive
5508720 the government is trying to argue that they will take various remedial measures but the experts that are advising the greens have no confidence that this will lessen the damage
5508721 the clear answer here is that that the dredging should not go ahead
5508722 there will be some minor disruptions theres no doubt about that but what we will do is make sure the environmental impacts are limited and temporary and at the same time well seek to minimise the disruption to recreational users
5508723 a whole range of environmental measures have been put in place including the use of silt curtains designed to catch sediment preventing it from flowing into the remaining parts of the water

5508730 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5508731 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5508732 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5508733 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5508747 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5508748 the goal right now should be and this is where i think we can find common ground is how do we reduce the number of abortions because the fact is that although weve had a president who is opposed to abortions over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5508749 i am in favor for example of limits on late term abortions if there is an exception for the mothers health now from the perspective of those who you know are pro life i think they would consider that inadequate and i respect their views i mean one of the things that ive always said is that on this particular issue
5508750 in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade
5508751 as you do not know how the spirit enters into the womb of the expectant mother so you do not know the works of god who makes all things

5508765 while foundations were given tax exempt status in order to serve the entire public good their leadership has a history of focusing most of their attention on pet causes such as the opera and elite universities
5508766 if donors are suddenly supposed to allocate grants by the color or sexual lifestyle of the grantee that donor intent will be distorted at the very least presumably we want money for cancer research to support the most promising research ideas not to be based on whether the labs have a rainbow coalition of phds the goal is to cure cancer
5508767 what ab 624 wont make any easier is charitable giving in california the washington d c based philanthropy roundtable along with former stanford law dean and naacp lawyer paul brest oppose the bill on the grounds that it will actually drive foundations out of the golden state as donors who do not want to expose grantees to the onerous reporting burden spend their money elsewhere and how will californias minorities and californians generally be served by that

5508783 i applaud secretary schafer for his decision to reduce the cost the use crp land for cimarron texas and beaver counties however i am extremely disappointed that this reduction isnt available for all counties in oklahoma

5508807 tambahan pula hakikatnya majoriti besar umat islam di malaysia adalah bangsa melayu lemahnya melayu tidak dapat tidak akan melemahkan islam di negara kita
5508808 ini tergambar dalam rangkaian ulama dan pemikir yang menjadi ideologi ideologi abim bahan rujukan dan terbitan serta seminar seminar tokoh yang kita anjurkan
5508809 ia juga tergambar dalam sebahagian manhaj gerakan pelbagai sikap dan pendirian abim termasuk sebahagian daripada manhaj maliziy salah satu konsep yang mencorakkan pendekatan gerakan kita

5508816 inilah juga perjuangan kami di indonesia untuk mengembalikan ajaran islam mengikut al quran dan sunnah
5508817 walaupun ini kali pertama menghadiri muktamar abim saya melihat ia berjaya sebagai wadah memperjuangkan islam
5508818 abim juga dilihat mampu menyatukan umat islam di malaysia melalui pendekatannya yang sederhana
5508819 saya berharap dapat memperluaskan lagi kerjasama dengan abim selepas ini
5508820 kami dan abim sudah menjalin persahabatan yang cukup lama ibarat adik dengan abang

5508823 muktamar kali ini membincangkan isu isu berkaitan islam yang bersifat setempat
5508824 perbincangan tentang soal bangsa melayu juga membuktikan bahawa abim memperjuangkan hal yang merentasi sempadan politik dan budaya
5508825 cuma muktamar kali ini tidak membincangkan secara khusus isu berkaitan wanita
5508826 seminar yang diadakan kali ini memang baik kerana ia membicarakan secara menyeluruh tajuk bangsa dan agama
5508827 perkembangan ini antara lain hikmah natijah pilihan raya umum ke 12

5508831 of course but deep inside you will always be a catholic
5508832 sounding board for me to make sure im speaking as truthfully about what i believe as possible
5508833 the government gives them the drugs builds bigger prisons passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing god bless america
5508834 no no no god damn thats in the bible for killing innocent people
5508835 the government lied about inventing the hiv virus as a means of genocide against people of color the government lied
5508836 we put mandela in prison and supported apartheid the whole 27 years he was there
5508837 we are only able to maintain our level of living by making sure the in addition to the
5508838 and with the sagging economy you know it started slowing down for a lot of downtown restaurants last spring and so thats been over a year now and were at a point now where we just cant keep our heads above water now
5508839 several of the restaurants that have closed in boise have opened in meridian louies restaurant ginos is relocating in one of our mixed use developments in bridgetower so you are seeing them recognize where the population center is and theyre listening to their patrons as well come closer to where we live
5508840 people dont necessarily want to drive a long way to go to the restaurant theyre choosing restaurants closer to them
5508841 i havent seen the major restaurant closures like weve seen in the boise area

5508843 what indicators can outside investors measure to help them predict the potential success of emerging market smes
5508844 listen like it or not what you do doesnt work what we do does work
5508845 well you got a point what we do doesnt work
5508846 hes going to make a decision and we want him to make that decision with all the information thats out there and not base it on any misconceptions or myths
5508847 he got a higher level of information than any other player has gotten he was really pleasantly surprised
5508848 we thought the meeting went well and marian expressed the same thing
5508849 i have a lot of respect for how they handled that
5508850 i dont control what they do i just represent marian
5508851 he really has no decisions to make the experience playing for the minnesota wild has been great we have no bones to pick about anything i really feel that marian has been treated well and has enjoyed his career there to date
5508852 even this must have a preface that is a literary preface
5508853 and behold he deigned to appear for a moment to the people to the tortured suffering people sunk in iniquity but loving him like children
5508854 he came softly unobserved and yet strange to say everyone recognised him
5508855 there are cries sobs confusion among the people and at that moment the cardinal himself the grand inquisitor passes by the cathedral
5508856 is it thou thou but receiving no answer he adds at once dont answer be silent what canst thou say indeed i know too well what thou wouldst say and thou hast no right to add anything to what thou hadst said of old why then art thou come to hinder us for thou hast come to hinder us and thou knowest that but dost thou know what will be to morrow i know not who thou art and care not to know whether it is thou or only a semblance of him but to morrow i shall condemn thee and burn thee at the stake as the worst of heretics and the very people who have to day kissed thy feet to morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of thy fire knowest thou that yes maybe thou knowest it he added with thoughtful penetration never for a moment taking his eyes off the prisoner
5508857 is it simply a wild fantasy or a mistake on the part of the old man some impossible quid pro quo
5508858 if you are so corrupted by modern realism and cant stand anything fantastic if you like it to be a case of mistaken identity let it be so it is true
5508859 the old man was ninety and he might well be crazy over his set idea he might have been struck by the appearance of the prisoner it might in fact be simply his ravings the delusion of an old man of ninety over excited by the auto da fe of a hundred heretics the day before but does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild fantasy all that matters is that the old man should speak out that he should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for ninety years
5508860 and the prisoner too is silent does he look at him and not say a word
5508861 the old man has told him he hasnt the right to add anything to what he has said of old
5508862 and whats the meaning of no lack of admonitions and warnings
5508863 why thats the chief part of what the old man must say
5508864 the wise and dread spirit the spirit of self destruction and non existence the old man goes on great spirit talked with thee in the wilderness and we are told in the books that he
5508865 judge thyself who was right thou or he who questioned thee then
5508866 thou wouldst go into the world and art going with empty hands with some promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural unruliness cannot even understand which they fear and dread for nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom but seest thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness turn them into bread and mankind will run after thee like a flock of sheep grateful and obedient though for ever trembling lest thou withdraw thy hand and deny them thy bread
5508867 who can compare with this beast he has given us fire from heaven
5508868 feed us for those who have promised us fire from heaven havent given it
5508869 this is the significance of the first question in the wilderness and this is what thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which thou hast exalted above everything
5508870 put away your gods and come and worship ours or we will kill you and your gods
5508871 so that in truth thou didst thyself lay the foundation for the destruction of thy kingdom and no one is more to blame for it
5508872 if thou wouldst know whether thou art the son of god then cast thyself down for it is written the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself and thou shalt know then whether thou art the son of god and shalt prove then how great is thy faith in thy father
5508873 come down from the cross and we will believe that thou art he
5508874 yes you were right you alone possess his mystery and we come back to you save us from ourselves
5508875 receiving bread from us they will see clearly that we take the bread made by their hands from them to give it to them without any miracle
5508876 your poem is in praise of jesus not in blame of him as you meant it to be and who will believe you about freedom is that the way to understand it thats not the idea of it in the orthodox church thats rome and not even the whole of rome its false those are the worst of the catholics the inquisitors the jesuits and there could not be such a fantastic creature as your inquisitor what are these sins of mankind they take on themselves who are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves for the happiness of mankind when have they been seen we know the jesuits they are spoken ill of but surely they are not what you describe they are not that at all not at all they are simply the romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future with the pontiff of rome for emperor thats their ideal but theres no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it its simple lust of power of filthy earthly gain of domination something like a universal serfdom with them as all they stand for they dont even believe in god perhaps your suffering inquisitor is a mere fantasy
5508877 how hot you are a fantasy you say let it be so of course its a fantasy but allow me to say do you really think that the roman catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power of filthy earthly gain is that father paissys teaching
5508878 no no on the contrary father paissy did once say something rather the same as you but of course its not the same not a bit the same
5508879 a precious admission in spite of your not a bit the same i ask you why your jesuits and inquisitors have united simply for vile material gain why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great sorrow and loving humanity you see only suppose that there was one such man among all those who desire nothing but filthy material gain if theres only one like my old inquisitor who had himself eaten roots in the desert and made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and perfect but yet all his life he loved humanity and suddenly his eyes were opened and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain perfection and freedom if at the same time one gains the conviction that millions of gods creatures have been created as a mockery that they will never be capable of using their freedom that these poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the tower that it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamt his dream of harmony seeing all that he turned back and joined the clever people surely that could have happened
5508880 they have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and secrets perhaps nothing but atheism thats all their secret your inquisitor does not believe in god thats his secret
5508881 what if it is so at last you have guessed it its perfectly true its true that thats the whole secret but isnt that suffering at least for a man like that who has wasted his whole life in the desert and yet could not shake off his incurable love of humanity in his old age he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble unruly incomplete empirical creatures created in jest and so convinced of this he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit the dread spirit of death and destruction and therefore accept lying and deception and lead men consciously to death and destruction and yet deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being led that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy and note the deception is in the name of him in whose ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his life long is not that tragic and if only one such stood at the head of the whole army filled with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain would not one such be enough to make a tragedy more than that one such standing at the head is enough to create the actual leading idea of the roman church with all its armies and jesuits its highest idea i tell you frankly that i firmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement who knows there may have been some such even among the roman popes who knows perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way is to be found even now in a whole multitude of such old men existing not by chance but by agreement as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the mystery to guard it from the weak and the unhappy so as to make them happy no doubt it is so and so it must be indeed i fancy that even among the masons theres something of the same mystery at the bottom and that thats why the catholics so detest the masons as their rivals breaking up the unity of the idea while it is so essential that there should be one flock and one shepherd but from the way i defend my idea i might be an author impatient of your criticism enough of it
5508882 i meant to end it like this when the inquisitor ceased speaking he waited some time for his prisoner to answer him his silence weighed down upon him he saw that the prisoner had listened intently all the time looking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply the old man longed for him to say something however bitter and terrible but he suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips that was all his answer the old man shuddered his lips moved he went to the door opened it and said to him go and come no more come not at all never never and he let him out into the dark alleys of the town the prisoner went away
5508883 the kiss glows in his heart but the old man adheres to his idea
5508884 why its all nonsense alyosha its only a senseless poem of a senseless student who could never write two lines of verse why do you take it so seriously surely you dont suppose i am going straight off to the jesuits to join the men who are correcting his work good lord its no business of mine i told you all i want is to live on to thirty and then dash the cup to the ground
5508885 but the little sticky leaves and the precious tombs and the blue sky and the woman you love how will you live how will you love them
5508886 with such a hell in your heart and your head how can you no thats just what you are going away for to join them if not you will kill yourself you cant endure it
5508887 the strength of the karamazovs the strength of the karamazov baseness
5508888 to sink into debauchery to stifle your soul with corruption yes
5508889 how will you escape it by what will you escape it thats impossible with your ideas
5508890 everything is lawful you mean everything is lawful is that it
5508891 ah youve caught up yesterdays phrase which so offended muisov and which dmitri pounced upon so naively and paraphrased
5508892 yes if you like everything is lawful since the word has been said i wont deny it and mityas version isnt bad
5508893 i thought that going away from here i have you at least
5508894 but now i see that there is no place for me even in your heart my dear hermit the formula all is lawful i wont renounce will you renounce me for that yes
5508895 you stole that from my poem thank you though get up alyosha its time we were going both of us
5508896 if i am really able to care for the sticky little leaves i shall only love them remembering you its enough for me that you are somewhere here and i shant lose my desire for life yet is that enough for you take it as a declaration of love if you like and now you go to the right and i to the left and its enough do you hear enough i mean even if i dont go away to morrow i think i certainly shall go and we meet again dont say a word more on these subjects i beg that particularly and about dmitri too i ask you specially never speak to me again
5508897 its all exhausted it has all been said over and over again hasnt it and ill make you one promise in return for it when at thirty i want to dash the cup to the ground wherever i may be ill come to have one more talk with you even though it were from america you may be sure of that ill come on purpose it will be very interesting to have a look at you to see what youll be by that time its rather a solemn promise you see and we really may be parting for seven years or ten come go now to your pater seraphicus he is dying if he dies without you you will be angry with me for having kept you good bye kiss me once more thats right now go
5508898 pater seraphicus he got that name from somewhere where from
5508899 ivan poor ivan and when shall i see you again here is the hermitage yes yes that he is pater seraphicus he will save me from him and for ever
5508900 its the only way they have of making sure this doesnt pass
5508901 obviously hes just a young quarterback and he needs to do it more and more to get comfortable with it well give him a limited menu and if gets into that situation fine hes going to go in probably in the third quarter
5508902 in closed agrarian societies families need a lot of children as insurance against disaster but in countries that have opened themselves up families can rely on other sorts of protection such as urban jobs or trade
5508903 immigrants your country needs them by philippe legrain and american alone by mark steyn both are very interesting
5508904 almost half of humanity spread over more than 40 nations lives in countries growing at 7 a year or more a rate that doubles the size of an economy in a decade this is twice the number of fast growers that existed in the years between 1980 and 2000
5508905 the most dramatic explanation for the improved living standards is the decline in the number of wars and in deaths from violence and genocide
5508906 in total the death toll in battle fell from over 200 000 a year in the to below 20 000 in the
5508907 i just met your beautiful wife backstage i worship her ill babysit
5508908 it is time the international community helped ease israel out from its fantasy world where stone and concrete equals right and justice
5508909 it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important
5508910 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system
5508911 everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration without distinction of any kind such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status

5509039 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all

5509051 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5509052 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5509053 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west the united states has supported those efforts
5509054 now russia has put its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

5509081 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5509082 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5509122 as a result of the new system we can produce a smaller window for backing up our live data and in the event of a catastrophic failure we can restore easily within a much faster timeframe
5509123 the system has already shrunk the storage space we use by 40 and is helping us back up data much more quickly
5509124 relevant data can quickly be recalled and in real time we can see what has been stored and apply the most critical data into a secure backup location

5509143 it is extremely important that we at the chiefs give back to our fans in as many ways as possible
5509144 its good to get back home and get into an environment thats going to be the way we do it from this point on through the regular season
5509145 i thought today was just a little tune up in getting them loose again well put the pads back on tomorrow a lot of good things off the arizona tape the outcome wasnt what we would have liked but we went into the game trying to run the football and we did a good job of running the ball
5509146 defensively i thought we did a good job with the exception of one drive in the first half they have five possessions and four of those possessions were three and out they had the one drive where some third downs got away from us
5509147 the offense has been pretty good in the two minute we got into the two minute mode at the end of the game and got down there and got a score now it was too late
5509148 we moved the ball some offensively the time of possession is something you always look at we held the ball for 34 minutes and ran the ball for about 163 yards what got us was the red zone and third downs we didnt do a good job of executing that we got into the red zone five times and only came out with seven points once thats not good enough for us third downs defensively especially with the second group got us
5509149 yep for what were asking him to do right now yes for we went into this game with an emphasis of running the football because we didnt do a good enough job of that last week against chicago
5509150 i think for the most part he didnt turn the ball over the sad part for is we get in the red zone and we dont score thats what youve got to be able to do
5509151 i think the first thing you realize with linemen or any player last year they were rookies with a lot of other guys on this team theyre more mature now they have a lot of confidence in themselves tank has lost some weight hes starting to rush the passer turk did a good job coming off the edge now theyve grown up
5509152 yeah and the thing you realize as you watch us play is weve built this defense for speed and weve got some speed guys theres no doubt about it up front linebackers who can run very talented and a young secondary thats going to get to play together for a long time we had our hands on some balls last week and we didnt come up with any we caused a couple of fumbles and we didnt get em were starting to get the ball out
5509153 were moving those guys all over the place you might see him at mike sometimes thats the flexibility you have with all those guys theyre a similar type of athlete they can play different positions and when you go into a nickel package hes on a different side there are all kinds of different places you can move him we can let him put his hand on the ground and rush too i just think the more we can do with these guys the better our defense
5509154 yeah a little bit but thats a part of donnie edwards being nicked too were trying to get players in spots where we can create some mismatches when you can do that you put the onus on the offense
5509155 i think so i think we all think so we didnt game plan anybody we went into the game with certain things we wanted to do and the big emphasis was run the ball if you look at that one drive i think we threw one pass we just ran the ball that was done on purpose it was no accident because we didnt do a good enough job the week before i said this after the game we didnt do enough running the ball we want to be able to possess the ball we want to be able to take time off the clock we had it 34 minutes if you have the ball 34 minutes and dont turn it over and you run the ball for about 150 or 170 yards a game you have a chance to win some football games
5509156 brodie can make all the throws there aint no doubt he can throw it deep he can throw it short he can throw it hard sometimes too hard but he can make all the throws and when we give him the game plan he will have to make some tight throws and make some decisions sometimes it works out sometimes it might not thats part of the process of him becoming a quarterback
5509157 there is one guy who led the league and i played against him and im not putting him in that class and thats fran tarkenton and he wasnt the biggest guy either there are a lot of quarterbacks who arent the perfect height
5509158 i think if you watch him play i think what you notice is he has the ability to throw the ball
5509159 thats part of it but thats a part of it when you have a young team and young players there is no way to get around it hes going to have to go through it
5509160 the problem is if youre a runner in this league eventually they catch you and they hurt you you really dont want your quarterback running a lot and when you do run you have to be a smart runner most of them who come dont get that right away if you get hit and have to leave the game you hurt the team the transition for college quarterbacks in this league is different in that the speed is lot faster the closing ability of the linebackers and corners are a lot faster
5509161 just watch him hes like a bowling ball with butcher knives on it its hard to tackle the guy hes not the biggest guy hes probably not the fastest guy and thats probably why he wasnt drafted but when you look at what he did at oklahoma state he broke a lot of records down there
5509162 he doesnt go down on the first hit if you think you can just hit him with your shoulder and dont wrap him up youve got problems hes got a very short base and very strong legs hes going to make yards when he gets ready to get hit he has the ability because hes not the tallest guy the ability to get his weight into you and hit you back youre not going to explode on him so much hes going to explode on you hes not going down youve got to tackle him
5509163 when the dream of planting in chicago died i was willing to go wherever the wild goose wanted to take me and honestly the farther away from chicago the better but i am not sure i would have been open to moving to dc if the ship hadnt sunk in chicago i still have lots of questions about that church plant were we even called to plant the church in the first place or did god plan the failure was our timing off or was it my ineptitude that caused it to sink i have more questions than answers but i came out of the experience with a new conviction sometimes it takes a shipwreck to get us where god wants us to go
5509164 the promptings of the holy spirit can sometimes seempointless but rest assured god is working his plan and if you chase the wild goose he will take you places you never could have imagined going by paths you never knew existed
5509165 i dont know a single christ follower who hasnt got stressed out trying to figure out the will of god we want to solve the mystery of the will of god the way we solve a sudoku or crossword puzzle but in my experience intellectual analysis usually results in spiritual paralysis
5509166 a part of us feels as if something is spiritually wrong with us when we experience circumstantial uncertainty but that is precisely what jesus promised us when we are born of the spirit and start following him most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

5509180 i think it comes back to the general underperformance of the commodity currencies as the day went on and a little bit of an increase in risk aversion as reflected by the fall in the stock market particularly the financials mr rothfield said from san francisco
5509181 we believe that the concern in the market about the australian commodity story and the banking story has been overdone mr rothfield said

5509224 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5509225 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5509226 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5509227 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be

5509243 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5509244 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5509245 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5509246 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5509247 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services

5509249 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5509250 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5509251 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5509252 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5509253 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5509254 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5509255 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5509256 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5509257 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5509262 we need to focus a lot more than we have before on the education opportunities for immigrant children this makes very clear that theyre a big part of our future

5509279 qantas has stated that the air conditioning fault on the aircraft is unrelated to heavy maintenance checks done in malaysia
5509280 regarding the heavy maintenance work for vh tju there is no basis to the
5509281 the maintenance in malaysia was done with the oversight of qantas personnel a total of 12 qantas engineering personnel were positioned at malaysia airlines e amp m to provide technical oversight in the course of the maintenance defects were found and all these were rectified after approvals by qantas personnel the aircraft flew back to australia
5509282 as for the case of a qantas flight attendant experiencing a static mild electric shock we have investigated and identified the root cause of the issue although it is not possible to ascertain if the defect originated from the work at malaysia airlines e amp m this will be monitored for future similar work to eliminate such instances from recurring
5509283 the decision has nothing to do with the media reports claiming that the first aircraft we maintained in malaysia returned with a

5509311 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
5509312 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
5509313 there were several stories similar to that in which guards a very few i might add showed compassion to the prisoners it was rare and i never met one but some of the guys did

5509384 i just get a lot of mail and phone calls from people who just want me to buy their credit cards
5509385 ive gotten a lot of phone calls too but its kind of hard because you really dont know what youre getting yourself into
5509386 every offer comes with a catch theres no such thing as a free lunch
5509387 i dont worry about people getting into my stuff i keep it pretty secure with locks and with passwords that arent simple to figure out

5509398 india appears to be a cheaper destination than anywhere else in the world for such trials
5509399 the club melbourne ambassadors are a very powerful face for melbourne
5509400 major international conventions and business events have a huge impact on victorias economy generating income that directly benefits our local industries creating jobs and overall economic wealth for the state and providing huge opportunities in the international business markets
5509401 as health minister i am particularly interested to see that over 80 per cent of the 19 major international conventions won are focused on community health biochemistry and molecular biology applied psychology human reproduction huntingtons disease and internal medicine to name just a few
5509402 vying for and then securing these major events for melbourne is not an easy task
5509403 the fact that the new melbourne convention centre will open its doors next year allows us to demonstrate that melbourne will have the infrastructure to easily accommodate large international business events like these and therefore take full advantage of the positive economic impact they bring to the state
5509404 qatar is considered one of the most important destinations in the world for production of energy products and services for this reason we are considering doha and the qatar national convention centre for one of our future international conference destinations
5509405 the increase in services by the airlines to the airport at a time when oil is at record highs displays the confidence the airlines have in newcastle airport this combined with the fact that the travelling public is embracing the increased services at a time when it is considered that people are tightening their belts confirms that fact that air travel has become part of everyday life
5509406 like the 1 million passengers the airport welcomed last calendar year 100 000 passengers in a single month has been that elusive milestone that the airport had been hoping to achieve for some time
5509407 give frequent business travelers a quick and secure means to enter the united states ultimately helping to promote the flow of international commerce
5509408 we urge continued efforts to expand the program even further by launching it at international airports throughout the united states
5509409 hong kong express airways as the carrier of choice in hong kong is committed to offering more flexibility to passengers travelling around the region together with our sister company hong kong airlines we want to give our customers more travel destination choices backed by very high quality ground and in flight services
5509410 ryanairs 2008 09 expansion programme could permanently reshape europes shorthaul market and the major airlines are becoming largely powerless to respond
5509411 with competitors tactical positions already set the decider will come down to one main item the unpredictable price of fuel recent investor reaction to announcements of ryanairs likely future losses due to high fuel costs was ugly to say the least
5509412 with variable costs under control and a product cost well below the main opposition the expansion formula is almost perfect
5509413 ryanair looks to be on the brink of establishing a near impregnable position in the market to complete the formula a short sharp drop in fuel prices with some effective hedging along with a prolonged economic slowdown would give the bludgeon plenty of room to move
5509414 now ive got no problem with the apostate part because i dont know what that word means but
5509415 it gives us the opportunity to treat areas with natural fire that before we couldnt

5509423 we thought the meeting went well and marian expressed the same thing
5509424 i have a lot of respect for how they handled that
5509425 i dont control what they do i just represent marian
5509426 he really has no decisions to make the experience playing for the minnesota wild has been great we have no bones to pick about anything i really feel that marian has been treated well and has enjoyed his career there to date

5509433 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers
5509434 we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5509435 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5509436 and they did travel they used to move down to mildura they used to go out to moree they used to go all these areas doing the fruit picking doing the cotton chipping
5509437 the extension of the quarantining of welfare payments needs to be extended into the dole payments as well
5509438 we have to get people back into that mindset that their uncles and their grandparents and their parents had about working
5509439 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5509440 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5509441 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5509442 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5509443 i think it comes back to the general underperformance of the commodity currencies as the day went on and a little bit of an increase in risk aversion as reflected by the fall in the stock market particularly the financials mr rothfield said from san francisco
5509444 we believe that the concern in the market about the australian commodity story and the banking story has been overdone mr rothfield said
5509445 we think that the rebound in the us dollar in general has overshot
5509446 scope for a less restrictive stance on monetary policy in the period ahead
5509447 go fares are not a seasonal or promotional sale they are a permanent new fare type and will be available on more than half of our routes at any one time
5509448 the discounts are genuine and undercut our own previous lowest lead in fares this is to allow price sensitive travellers to offset new baggage fees and to also provide support for regional and leisure destinations in particular
5509449 this is yet another sad day for california and its citizens freedom
5509450 it seems that every few weeks we witness another constitutional freedom or right being taken away from us by activist judges bent on forcing homosexuality upon us
5509451 it is imperative that california voters stand up against this judicial tyranny by voting for proposition 8 in november if we fail to hold out judges and lawmakers accountable now we will soon have no rights to simply practice our religion or speak our beliefs publicly
5509452 many travellers coming to macau want to be part of the heritage and character of old macau while still seeking the luxury of a contemporary 5 star hotel and thats exactly what sofitel macau offers
5509453 ponte 16 is an outstanding development that revitalises one of macaus most distinctive heritage areas when the development is fully completed the precinct will be one of macaus most vibrant areas with an excellent range of restaurants bars entertainment venues and retail outlets to complement the peninsulas historic attractions which are on sofitel macaus doorstep
5509454 the vast interest in historic cities bodes well for macau and with ponte 16s commitment to maintaining the historic integrity of the waterfront district we believe sofitel macau will attract strong interest from visitors around the world including discerning leisure travellers and high end conference and incentive groups

5509461 qantas is the only airline to incorporate an accessibility function that works like the phone itself using its touch interface rather than offering services through a website link
5509462 qantas group customers will eventually be able to arrange their whole travel experience using the iphone from searching fares and timetables to booking flights selecting seats and on line check in
5509463 qantas will soon be offering its customers the same services available on the iphone on other mobile devices such as blackberry and smart phones
5509464 these technological enhancements are part of qantass broader mobile strategy giving customers access to information and services via portable devices
5509465 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5509466 it didnt take the russian forces long to get into georgia
5509467 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5509468 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5509469 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5509470 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5509471 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5509472 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5509473 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship

5509480 what i believe is really at risk here is the collision between two conceptions of security operative in the world
5509481 the russians are reasserting a sphere of influence view the u s is continuing to pursue what might be called a global conception of security where there are no acknowledged geographical limitations
5509482 it is a matter of national security to regard any threat posed anywhere on the planet as something that we are reasonably entitled to address
5509483 i think this is the first skirmish that brings this issue into the open so vividly
5509484 the changed russian position is i think a very important element
5509485 they have a leadership that is supported by the population they have had sustained economic growth they have vast energy reserves in a market that shows increased scarcity and theyve been pushed around their security interests have been ignored
5509486 with a lot of resources now to play with will be very tempted to enter into a kind of arms race with the u s and that will certainly generate tensions reminiscent of the cold war era
5509487 and we embraced him in a way that may have encouraged him to be an even looser cannon

5509527 usually you see bait fish on the water you dont see no bait fish nothing nothings there
5509528 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5509529 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5509530 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5509531 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5509532 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5509533 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5509534 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5509535 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5509536 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5509537 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5509538 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something

5509556 this is a huge moral victory for hezbollah and its various operatives and supporters inside america of which there are plenty who are a lot more discreet than houssein zorkot and its a huge moral victory for the tens of thousands of shiite muslims in dearbornistan and dearbornistan heights and throughout the detroit area all of whom support hezbollah and most of whom were rooting for and defending this guy zorkot none of them spoke out against zorkot or what he did

5509577 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5509578 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5509579 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5509580 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5509581 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5509582 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5509603 i cant tell you how happy i am to finally have a job i can do at home thanks for giving me this opportunity you guys are great
5509604 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5509605 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5509606 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5509607 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5509608 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5509609 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5509610 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5509611 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5509612 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5509613 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5509614 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5509615 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5509616 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5509617 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5509618 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5509619 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5509620 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5509621 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5509622 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5509623 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5509624 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5509625 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5509626 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5509627 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5509628 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5509629 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5509630 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5509631 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5509632 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5509633 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5509634 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5509635 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5509636 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5509637 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5509638 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5509639 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5509640 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5509641 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5509642 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5509643 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5509644 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5509645 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5509646 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5509647 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5509648 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5509649 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5509650 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5509651 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5509652 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5509653 who are open to doing something on the production side
5509654 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5509655 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5509656 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5509657 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5509658 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5509659 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5509660 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5509661 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5509662 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5509663 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5509664 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5509665 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5509666 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5509667 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

5509671 sometimes i think these political bobble heads just think way too much for their own good personally i have been wondering myself why they havent just raised the sales tax across the board in california and stop the bleeding already its a no brainer quick fix that will hit all people equally in the wallet i have lived here all 38 years of my life and i know how bad it is especially concerning our school budget cuts but instead of the proposal to raise property taxes which would only hit those who own a home an equally fair option is to raise the sales tax rates up a percent across the state its really not rocket science as much as they would like everyone to think
5509672 the challenges of green tourism are the responsibility of every company organization and individual working in travel and tourism today

5509676 contrary to what some people still believe green tourism can increase business efficiency cut energy costs increase customer and staff satisfaction plus create that all important feel good factor for both the business and visitors
5509677 we wanted to combine the events to underline the crucial importance of quality in every aspect of travel

5509697 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it

5509706 doctors who do not agree with me should have their ethics questioned

5509712 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation
5509713 becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
5509714 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5509715 the mission zero initiative is not about taking sides or blaming either workers or employers it is about changing our attitudes very clearly to be successful we need everyones attention employers and workers need to work together to help achieve our goal employers have clear responsibilities under the occupational health and safety act workers have both rights and responsibilities

5509719 employers have the most control over the conditions of work and how it is to be done they therefore have the greatest legal and moral responsibility for health and safety in the workplace

5509732 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect

5509751 we found theres really no link between smoke free laws and bingo revenues one way or the other

5509756 who were the three wisest people that you know that you would rely on heavily in an administration
5509757 i believe you are the senile one warren asked the exact same questions worded exactly the same to both candidates
5509758 ahhh uhhh ahhh ohhh ahhhs and hardly ever finding a word to use is he ever a boring talker probably the worst i have ever listened to
5509759 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5509760 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5509761 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5509762 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5509763 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5509764 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5509765 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5509766 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5509767 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5509768 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5509769 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5509770 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5509771 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5509772 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5509773 it is kind of frustrating wondering who the starting quarterback is
5509774 thats probably one of the most important players on the team is the quarterback now that weve got it all resolved and we know who the starter is then now we can get down to business
5509775 what am i supposed to do with 4 000 i cant buy a new house in cambodia with that money if theyre willing to reimburse me fairly ill gladly move
5509776 we havent moved yet but were all scared when they come and clear us out we dont know what they will do
5509777 the problem is that this caters to a tiny powerful group
5509778 the government is attempting to develop and modernise cambodia quickly but theyve lost sight of the people theyre trying to help
5509779 this is close to the largest forced displacement of people if you count all the elections and years that it has been happening
5509780 conserved developed managed and used in a rational and sustainable manner
5509781 filling boeng kake lake will have untold environmental consequences as it is the primary natural reservoir where rainwater is collected during the monsoon season
5509782 it is hard to believe city hall officials that the lake filling will not lead to flooding and other negative environmental consequences
5509783 but i dont agree with private developers using the governments name to get their way
5509784 what am i supposed to do with 4 000 i cant buy a new house in cambodia with that money
5509785 if theyre willing to reimburse me fairly ill gladly move
5509786 as with any policy if you cannot fairly compensate those negatively impacted
5509787 then it goes to show that the policy is not an effective one
5509788 we cannot prevent lightning strikes but we can protect ourselves from them
5509789 my goal is to do whatever we can to withdraw all the troops from the keo sikha kiri svara pagoda
5509790 and the new line agreed by the thai and cambodian government actually brings more land into thailand than the old map if the cambodian government is happy to concede some land to the thais while retaining the temple that is and has always been on cambodian soil then it is a win for the thai governmen i cannot believe the lunatics at the pad have actually got the thai people and the puea pandin party fooled over the preah vihear temple
5509791 and the new line agreed by the thai and cambodian government actually brings more land into thailand than the old map
5509792 this current situation that arose led to a foreign minister to resign a sweeping victory for cambodian prime minister hun sen and his party in cambodia so it had domestic dimensions where kicking a nationalist ball is part of the political game
5509793 if the assembly wants to hold a meeting it can but a big part of it would not represent eligible voters
5509794 so when it goes to the constitutional council they have a two third majority there i say this as a citizen not a constitutional council member
5509795 it means the majority in a democratic assembly can amend the constitution
5509796 but they cannot conspire to do so when the country is in a state of emergency or conspire to eliminate article 51 which defends a democratic multi party system
5509797 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5509798 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5509799 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5509800 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5509801 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5509802 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5509803 americans need to get over the political bigotry that there are only two parties
5509804 must be astonishing to canadians who have a multiparty system
5509805 mainstream political parties can essentially cooperate in failing to even attempt to solve problems faced by a majority of citizens usually because they have been funded and supported in other ways by large corporations
5509806 naders presidential campaign as with other similar past campaigns by independents and third parties serve the purpose of educating people about the huge gaps in the mainstream parties platforms
5509807 not stupid theyve developed a highly proficient way of censoring themselves
5509808 until these loopholes are closed you will continue to see regular dishonest unethical secretive unrepresentative and wasteful actions by governments and corporations
5509809 hello americans cut the crap stop making excuses and take over
5509810 protest the corporate control over our political system and to call for opening the presidential debates
5509811 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5509812 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5509813 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5509814 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5509815 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5509816 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5509817 i have never been happier in my life we are over the moon
5509818 i was not expecting to be pregnant on my wedding day but then ive always done things a little controversial
5509819 opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5509820 why destroy the people who are with us this is not imperialism or a foreign invasion i tell my brothers that if there was a benefit and a need to carry arms i will be the first to arm you train and fight along with you
5509821 from today bahanga and i are at your disposal we consider libya alone can resolve the rebellions in mali and niger
5509822 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5509823 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5509824 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5509825 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5509826 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5509827 please pray for ashlee on wednesday she has a mri under sedation at rileys and on thursday my mom sharon is having major neck surgery at st joe hospital
5509828 the forms are issued by commune councilors and not by election workers
5509829 i dont think we can keep control of violent prisoners by calling them by their first name
5509830 biography is the mesh through which our real life escapes
5509831 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5509832 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5509833 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5509834 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5509835 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5509836 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5509837 but i see that r james woolsey a former director of the c i a serves on the board of american congress for truth your educational foundation
5509838 if you are worried about death threats why would you put a glamorous photograph of yourself on the cover of your new book
5509839 efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5509840 to go from a small town like taunton and go to america and do all the research he does especially this as part of the nobel peace prize is a great achievement
5509841 voted for the iraq war before he voted against it
5509842 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5509843 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5509844 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5509845 he was obviously uncomfortable and we were uncomfortable you cant just develop policy on the spot so not knowing who this person was i had no idea what his standards were and i think we certainly had the discretion to ask him to leave
5509846 im an independent reporter who does original research and has a record of being credentialed
5509847 i dont think theres any question im a member of the media
5509848 sign whatever it is the favored members of the media have to sign swear to whatever they have to swear to
5509849 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5509850 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5509851 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5509852 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5509853 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5509854 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5509855 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5509856 physically its possible well have a game plan and well be ready and firing for gold
5509857 its shit or bust weve both been preparing for this for a year me and chris hoy
5509858 its like a hurdle race as team psychiatrist steve peters says
5509859 im just riding for the semi final at the moment ill look at the videos tomorrow formulate a plan im surprising myself how strong i still feel after four days racing but bourgains no muppet hes been up there every year
5509860 i just want to get stuck in and do it now the waiting has been the worst part i want to take it on
5509861 its been very emotional just watching the boys and not racing watching the heats of the keirin i was in tears and it had hardly started
5509862 just a medal wont do it has to be gold

5509874 ja kas ta ldse on normaalne kui keegi on ikkagi tapnud kas tema koht ongi inimeste hulgas
5509875 ta pidi kolm inimest enne ra tapma et n d siis l puks eluaegse saaks nagu inimkatsed tapab siis laseme v lja vanglast et kki enam ei tapa kki hakkab korralikuks karistuss steem on meil paraku nii leebe kui sa ikka tahtlikult oled teise inimese elu v tnud siis karistus peaks olema selline et ta ei saaks enam teistega koos eladagi pannakse eraldi ja ongi k ik oleme nii j ukad k ll et j uame selle kinni maksta et ohtlikud inimesed eraldatakse

5509882 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5509883 he was frosty at first he felt betrayed when she dumped him for his friend lance but after a while he caved in and has been sweet to her
5509884 its not fair to owen because he really cares for her and ends up getting hurt
5509885 det r relativt tydligt att utl nningarna inte s ker asyl f r att stanna i sverige utan f r att erh lla st d
5509886 with the way our world is going i wanted to show my kids you can have something nice something good for not a lot of money
5509887 if i can keep the heating and cooling bills under 100 a month ill be pleased but im hoping for much better there is a home in new mexico built like this that heats and cools for 77 a year
5509888 in california they give an insurance discount for homes built with hay when you have a frame home you have a built in chimney every 16 inches with this design there is very little air so its hard for it to burn
5509889 shell have to decide then well put wood up where pictures will hang and stucco over it
5509890 ill mix sand and caliche in a five to one mix probably add some straw and till it together ill smooth it as a base at about three inches and when it dries add another inch and seal it with linseed oil
5509891 but i think shes begun to understand that shell have to come to the landing and rail before she can be seen i designed it that way because i want the kids to be able to enjoy the openness
5509892 what simon pure is segment an gold dig gilt even stephen a pump
5509893 the water level of the mekong river keeps rising and now its reached the street in front of my house
5509894 we dont know when the water is going to recede because this is just the beginning of the monsoon season
5509895 although it cannot be said for sure that the chinese dams were to blame for the inundation they are certainly contributing to ecological and hydrological changes in the river
5509896 we know only a quarter of suicide patients are our clients which means 75 percent of them never come through our doors
5509897 we need to focus on prevention building resilience in students and creating communities
5509898 i think i would have been ashamed and reluctant to go to the doctor but it always helps to have somebody around you who has had some experience
5509899 i think people will think twice or more times before they actually think maybe i should go to a doctor
5509900 under communism many dissidents were sent to psychiatric hospitals without having any mental illness
5509901 for example now my employer knows that i am taking medicine i wasnt afraid to tell him about it because i am on very good terms with him but if i were applying for another job and they were asking about my health i would never tell them
5509902 people do not talk about mental health especially something like depression that hasnt changed much since 20 years ago
5509903 they come with depression or anxiety and this type of medication is the treatment of choice if i feel that their problem is treatable solely with psychotherapy then i refer them to psychologists or psychotherapists
5509904 its not uncommon to dole out medication instead of sending the patient for a psychiatric referral or therapy
5509905 medication can be really worthwhile to help certain people lead normal lives
5509906 but its really important to know each specific patient you cant just use a cookie cutter recipe for everyone
5509907 for the first time i realized therapy is just as important a part of treating bipolar disorder as the medicine
5509908 you have to think it will pass sooner or later but at that moment i thought well i dont know i dont know how long it will be and i dont want to wait that long
5509909 i found it quite disturbing you are in a room and all the patients stand up and they talk to the doctor about how they are feeling in front of all the other patients i found it very embarrassing
5509910 now with the baby born i think everything will quiet down
5509911 well it wont be quiet obviously well be very busy
5509912 have been back here several times since my first review and i have to say nothing but absolutely fantastic customer service great
5509913 in this day in age of hmos ppos and deteriorating health plans it is great to see that there are still doctors out there that still care
5509914 were sorry but the head you are calling has been disconnected
5509915 obamas granny has selected the vp she will announce this afternoon at 5 00 pm eastern time
5509916 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5509917 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5509918 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5509919 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5509920 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5509921 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5509922 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5509923 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5509924 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5509925 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5509926 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5509927 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5509928 hmmm we realize that someone cannot mention everything in one column so that these are selected things that professor clayson has learned i am sorry that he has chosen to publish such negative stuff since there is a lot more to learn
5509929 i would just like to mention that calling those holding an opposing view stupid is nothing new
5509930 mccain is still considered the republican candidate for president while edwards is not
5509931 i have heard over and over again about mccains affair what channel are you watching i think it is one of the only things the democrats have that and showing pics over and over of mccain with bush as if because he took a pic with him he is just like him
5509932 jeroze doyou read anything other than left wing talking points
5509933 the polls are tied yet i cant find anything reporting that bit of info here or on the national sites why
5509934 what does it matter if mccain had an affair its common knowledge that obama had an affair as well
5509935 today prof clayson denounces the press for its religious reverence to obama he then tries to prove it by providing three examples
5509936 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits
5509937 jeroze you are right on mccains affair i did not see the entire saddle back event i was watching the swimming
5509938 cross you kill me every week i cant help but think you read a different article than me each week because your generalizations of claysons intent and meaning behind is writing seams to be much different than what i read
5509939 i dont get it the title says it all now liberals everywhere are trying to say clayson did not learn these things
5509940 cire asks what does it matter if mccain had an affair
5509941 cross is your goal to be insulting to people because if it is you are surely reaching your goals
5509942 sorry cire i wont take you seriously anymore and please dont take what i just wrote seriously
5509943 if you watched that youtube video and thought they were being serious im beyond concerned
5509944 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining
5509945 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5509946 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5509947 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5509948 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5509949 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5509950 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5509951 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the cease fire agreement are the forces that were in there at the aug 6 time frame
5509952 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5509953 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5509954 mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5509955 mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5509956 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions
5509957 cone of silence is a silly term i used from maxwell smart
5509958 we had him a green room in a totally different building
5509959 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5509960 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5509961 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
5509962 it just seems inexplicable that this whole thing has been such an issue but clearly the mccain campaign wants this to be an issue wants to paint him as someone whos unfeeling about the troops
5509963 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5509964 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5509965 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5509966 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5509967 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5509968 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5509969 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same boat pulling the same oar the same way
5509970 when you go to the gas pump you dont check whether you are a democrat or republican
5509971 now dependent on foreign nations for 70 percent of its oil the u s is exporting 700 billion annually more than four times the cost of the iraq war
5509972 there are people standing by with billions ready to invest in the future sun wind geothermal biomass
5509973 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5509974 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5509975 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people
5509976 importing 70 percent of our oil now thats an issue of security its going to take us 10 years to reduce our dependency by 30 percent
