6860000 over 1 000 nests of loggerhead and green turtles were lost by this storm just on juno beach
6860001 the loggerheads were hit the hardest because they typically do not nest as high on the beach as green turtles more than half of the unhatched nests on the beach during the storm were impacted in one way or another some were over washed by the large waves others gained additional sand over the eggs
6860002 though sometimes disturbing these events are natural processes that the turtles are quite used to and in this case the hatchlings and turtle eggs should be left alone
6860003 just after the storm subsided over 150 hatchlings and eggs were brought to lmc hoping we could care for them and while it appears people are doing the correct thing it is actually in the best interests of the hatchlings to let nature take its course
6860004 under article 38 2 of the republican constitution if the office of president becomes vacant by reason of his death the vice president or if the vice president is absent or is unable due to physical or mental infirmity to discharge the functions of his office a member of the cabinet elected by the cabinet shall perform the functions of office of president until a person elected as president assumes office
6860005 ninety days refers to 90 calendar days in this case the 90 days began to run on the 19th august 2008 when president mwanawasa died the period of 90 days includes saturdays and sundays as well as public holidays it also includes the days of national mourning
6860006 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6860007 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6860008 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6860009 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6860010 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6860011 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6860012 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6860013 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6860014 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6860015 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6860016 true communication is possible only between equals because inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies than for telling the truth a central tenet of discordianism often invoked by hackers to explain why authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically the effect of the s n a f u principle is a progressive disconnection of decision makers from reality
6860017 the fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt

6860027 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6860028 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6860029 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6860030 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia

6860032 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6860033 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6860151 everyone came to china for a medal and we got one its not what we were expecting at the beginning but its one of the most important awards
6860152 steven has had two injuries he was 10 15 days without training and then it happened again
6860153 clearly in a couple of weeks he will be back to his best he has needed time to get fit after his injuries and it has been important to protect him
6860154 steven has great game intelligence and he can play anywhere gerrard played with intelligence and england drew that is all i would want to say about it
6860155 we know what is the best position for gerrard but he is capable of playing in other positions
6860156 we know where he can play really well and we know where he likes to play we will concentrate on using him to his strengths
6860157 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future

6860164 the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him
6860165 we have had an approach from stoke about sami but we want to keep him
6860166 when we talked about a new contract in the summer it was clear that sami wanted to stay at the club
6860167 so that technical professionals can better connect with each other share knowledge and succeed
6860168 hes coming to training camp and hes going to try to prove that he can make the team

6860179 we recognize the fact that the trajectory of our traffic in our business is unacceptable
6860180 as we work our way down to how were actually going to get the traffic all the brands have been told until the product and the store conditions improve and until the appropriate marketing messages have been identified then there will be no release of funds to drive marketing
6860181 were cutting costs to make sure when the time is right we can afford marketing
6860182 i think gap is a brand that is pretty close theyre much closer in the way of the journey of product store whats the message then if theres a return for that marketing theres no question well spend it
6860183 the poll suggests that frustration and disillusionment among social conservatives may be a part of the reason why a greater number now think that religious institutions should keep out of politics
6860184 the greatest increases since 2004 in the view that churches and other houses of worship should not express themselves on political matters have occurred among less educated republicans and people who say that social issues such as abortion and same sex marriage will be important to their vote

6860226 i definitely do not have any reports of a large amount of civilian casualties and we dont have any reports of civilian casualties at all
6860227 planes bombed the area and in the result 25 taliban were killed including two famous commanders
6860228 unfortunately five civilians were killed and one woman and a boy were wounded

6860241 el fin de semana ha tenido un buen arranque pero es demasiado pronto para decir d nde podemos encontrar dificultades
6860242 because of the security gains that have been realized since the president ordered five additional brigades and marines into iraq last january
6860243 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq
6860244 the security in baghdad allowed the government to come together and make some of the political reconciliation make some of the political progress that we all sought
6860245 how can any progressive look themselves in the mirror after the election if mccain wins and they have not devoted at least some time to the obama campaign
6860246 i promise to appoint more justices to the supreme court like roberts
6860247 when i was a child i thought as a child but when i grew up i put away childish things
6860248 we have to put this matter in front of the law
6860249 we need to put closure to this nightmare that weve been living through for two years
6860250 its not only personal im speaking on behalf of so many
6860251 at least we can raise our voices maybe we can put pressure on the government to at least give us an answer
6860252 he is the prime minister hes supposed to look after the people
6860253 this is a very sad lost opportunity and a crushing blow to the families of the 24 missing officials
6860254 who do you think you are to challenge the government
6860255 it was clear that the operation was well planned because it took only few minutes and the people who carried out the raid knew very well what to do without mistakes
6860256 when the crisis ended i rushed to my house and stayed there without going outside even to the garden for four days out of fear
6860257 han de hacerse con antelaci n antes de que los turistas dejen de venir

6860259 como el alza en el precio del petr leo y una coyuntura de crisis
6860260 hay que pensar que el turismo es un sector que se va a ver afectado por la crisis pero en menor medida que el inmobiliario o el financiero

6860262 my job as a supreme court justice is to write opinions and dissents when necessary
6860263 i was prevented from doing so by a majority of the court
6860264 nein ich bin ihn entlanggerannt ich sah erst die olympischen spiele und dann lief ich selbst f nf kilometer das war gut etwas warm war es weil es halbzwei am nachmittag war wir m ssen den leuten in valencia zu ihrer arbeit gratulieren ich war vor einigen monaten hier und ich hatte nicht geglaubt dass sie den kurs so schnell fertigstellen w rden
6860265 das ergebnis ist nicht nur ein stra enkurs es ist mehr als das das war wirklich eine beeindruckende arbeit die umgebung hier ist fantastisch f r die formel 1 ist das ein weiterer sch ner kurs mit schiffen im hafen das ist der richtige weg f r die formel 1 ich bin sehr beeindruckt von der arbeit hier in valencia
6860266 ist es f r die formel 1 besser auf den traditionsstrecken zu fahren und zu neuen orten wie valencia oder singapur zu gehen
6860267 auf den traditionsstrecken die in silverstone deutschland oder spa ist es vielleicht schwierig alle unsere leute unterzubringen als wir als rennteam begannen waren es 120 oder gar nur 80 leute nun sind es viel mehr menschen mehr leute von den medien das macht es schwierig speziell in spa und silverstone die richtung mit singapur und valencia neue orte zu holen ist korrekt
6860268 h ttest du dir vor acht jahren zu tr umen gewagt dass die formel 1 in spanien so erfolgreich sein und zwei rennen haben w rde
6860269 ich glaube dass fernando alonso die formel 1 nach spanien gebracht hat wir alle wissen wie schwierig es war hier in spanien grands prix im fernsehen zu zeigen mit fernando hat spanien die formel 1 kennengelernt ohne ihn h tten wir hier weiter 350 zuschauer wie einst ohne fernando g be es keine formel 1 ist spanien das ist eine tatsache
6860270 glaubst du dass renault in der motorenentwicklung etwas zur ckliegt
6860271 soweit wie ich wei gibt es keine motorenentwicklung wir haben eingefrorene motoren ich glaube nicht dass es irgendwelche entwicklungen gibt ich glaube was passiert ist ist recht einfach die regel war gedacht um geld zu sparen um die motorenabteilung zu schrumpfen renault hat genau das gemacht was die regel wollte wir haben 97 leute weniger dort besch ftigt f r mich gibt es da keine weiterentwicklung
6860272 vielleicht haben wir einen sehr teuren motor eingefroren wenn wir diese regel aber nicht h tten dann h tten wir vielleicht jetzt einen motor der 27 000 umdrehen je minute dreht wir sind dieser regel jedenfalls gefolgt und wenn wir jetzt zur ckliegen dann ist das nicht nur der motor es ist auch das auto die aerodynamik in den vergangenen drei montagen hat sich das auto verbessert und fernando hat toll gearbeitet um alle im team zu motivieren
6860273 aber wir haben das einfrieren der motoren wollen dabei aber niemanden f r f nf jahre bestrafen das w re zu lang wenn jemand mit der zuverl ssigkeit probleme hatte ich erinnere mich dass mclaren einmal ein problem damit hatte dann bin ich sicher dass die fia die richtige l sung hat damit der motor das rennen durchsteht dar ber reden wir

6860415 mum took me down to the local canoe club when i was 10 and i loved it so much i never looked back
6860416 she supported me all the way and it was a huge regret that she didnt live long enough to see me win the world championships last year
6860417 i went to her grave and left the flowers they gave me for winning it was an emotional moment for me now the focus is on getting that prized gold medal im determined to do it and it will be dedicated to her

6860437 a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte
6860438 the human shield thing works better if you use someone who hasnt shot me
6860439 casey doesnt really have a calm center he has an angry center
6860440 and they bought him a car and a gas card and a blueberry
6860441 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
6860442 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
6860443 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
6860444 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
6860445 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6860446 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6860447 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6860448 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6860449 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6860450 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6860451 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6860452 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6860453 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
6860454 we all need to realize that we need to invest our money differently
6860455 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
6860456 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
6860457 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6860458 i first got the idea to do the film when i visited the plain of jars in laos in 2002
6860459 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordnance was everywhere
6860460 then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
6860461 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
6860462 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21st century
6860463 outsourcing the war to private companies gathering public support by falsifying intelligence and documents embedded journalism and automated warfare including the use of so called smart weapons all these methods were first tested in laos
6860464 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
6860465 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
6860466 we destroyed a whole civilisation we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomised human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
6860467 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
6860468 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
6860469 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
6860470 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
6860471 there are still some groups but they are not organised they are certainly not politically or militarily organised they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else
6860472 whether vang pao is guilty or not of the charges he is facing one thing that is true is that he and other expatriate hmong have used these people as pawns
6860473 vang pao has also got millions of dollars out of the hmong community in the u s under the guise of liberating their homeland
6860474 i do not see that happening in the next few years it is still far too sensitive on the part of the lao government
6860475 they are also keen not to risk unsettling relations with the americans by opening it up
6860476 it is the last chapter of the vietnam war and both governments have an interest in making sure it is forgotten
6860477 this is a big loss for our team and very difficult for stephanie
6860478 her unique style of gymnastics made her a crowd favorite and she was a valuable contributor for the past two years unfortunately she came to us with some significant back problems that never healed sufficiently for her to consistently train and compete our doctors have advised us that this is a decision that is in the best interests of her long term health
6860479 a social trend in which people use technologies to get the things they need from each other rather than from traditional institutions like corporations

6860485 le plan de la soci t pr voit un retournement la hausse de la production sur le trimestre janvier mars mais rien ne dit que la demande ne va pas continuer baisser

6860487 nous gardons une appr ciation positive du potentiel de croissance induit par les points forts de toyota dans les technologies environnementales comme les v hicules hybrides
6860488 okay i unglue the feathered pillows of my face at 5 00 am daily and even the weekend believe it or not its of my own choice i guess i get up before the round magygeee called sun does when it come to time i love to salvage every dear second so to speak in my life to live to the fullest in every way possible so when i do get up at 5 even mind works better sharper quicker etc and the ironic part is i used to love to sleeeeeep in but hated feeling like a sleeepy ancient sleepy egyptian mummy latter in the day with a such a lag it was not funny beside that i do a lot of different things in this round planet call earth so i need as much time as possible and i do go to sleep at 10 00 pm not to mention im a writer and writhing a book takes a lot of time so sarah now you know about my cook clock and when it wakes me up so to speak let me see what maybe is the size of the bike and that can assist you better is their any other concerns for in regards to the bike robert

6860496 as consumers are bombarded with more green messages they are becoming wearier and more critical of what those eco wrapped packages contain and whos behind them
6860497 you know maybe company xs efforts to support the environment arent legit
6860498 these days it seems like every brand manager wants his or her brand to be green green is a microtrend that actually falls under the umbrella of the larger more strategic macrotrend conscience
6860499 a fundamental societal shift that influences consumer attitudes over a long period of time

6860508 we rely on our eyes every time we step into a car especially our peripheral vision depth perception and focusing skills
6860509 this link between vision and driving makes it essential for motorists to take steps to maintain healthy vision just as they take other safety precautions on the road
6860510 most people are aware of the dangers of drinking and driving but are unaware that driving drowsy can be just as fatal
6860511 in fact traffic safety and sleep experts believe that drowsy driving is much more common than even federal statistics indicate
6860512 in considering the current national trends in home game scheduling and the desire to have the razorbacks at war memorial stadium in the future the commission worked together with the university to accommodate a two game schedule while extending the overall agreement
6860513 with the new contract weve taken care of the next nine seasons and were in a much better position to continue renovating and enhancing war memorial stadium
6860514 we are pleased that the long standing tradition of razorback football at war memorial stadium will continue in the years to come thanks to a contract extension through 2016

6860518 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs

6860580 we are satisfied the settlement is fair to both parties and we are ready to put this one behind us
6860581 when you go to trial its always risky im sure the wal mart lawyers would have been good and aggressive and may have new information

6860583 its a shame that john xxiii died right in the middle of the council or otherwise it mightve gone further than it actually did

6860585 i never felt betrayed by the company that produced it
6860586 as the supervising rabbi for all glatt kosher meat and strictly kosher poultry at the agriprocessors plant in postville i am responsible for the well being of the slaughterers shochtim and supervising mashgichim rabbis
6860587 to protect the integrity of the kashruth their relationship is strictly with us under no circumstances can we permit that this relationship be compromised and thus is off limits to outside scrutiny as is prescribed by jewish law
6860588 it is no secret that agriprocessors was forced to cut back production of meat and poultry after more than a third of its labor force was seized in a may 12th raid by immigration and customs enforcement
6860589 while the company has made big strides in hiring new workers and restoring production it is still significantly behind may 12th levels
6860590 for the kosher slaughterers and rabbis this has meant not being able to work multiple shifts and a 6 day work week cutting into their ability to make more money while also making do with the companys policy of a lag time in their paychecks

6860596 due to the unprecedented demand our inventories have been depleted
6860597 we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
6860598 this whole thing started about the time the ruskies made their move
6860599 it may very well be that the usgovt is preparing for the real financial meltdown by hoarding all remaining gold flows
6860600 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6860601 if i dont have something to sell i lose business
6860602 the situation is strange and doesnt fit the normal supply amp demand economic model
6860603 the suspension is overwhelming evidence that the commodities exchanges are being used as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals currency and bond markets
6860604 no debe sorprendernos esta alta creencia de que existan otras formas de vida

6860698 we are pleased to be named to inc magazines inc 5000 list for the second year in a row
6860699 the distinction continues to prove that claris networks leads the marketplace in east tennessee with innovative and customer oriented solutions and services
6860700 we continue to emphasize that customer service is the key to growth and we are pleased to provide the best service of any it infrastructure solutions provider in the country
6860701 for all sad words of tongue and pen the saddest are these it might have been
6860702 the services contract performed by ibm engineers on site will help with hardware recovery times and thus facilitate lentas objective to reduce risks related to hardware operations and make the companys it infrastructure more stable
6860703 ibms retail industry and it services experience will ultimately help lenta provide better services to its customers
6860704 we selected ibm because it has a service center and a stock of spare parts and components in st petersburg another key factor that influenced our choice was ibm russia and cis service departments invariable focus on customer needs the fact that ibm engineers are highly qualified and have the knowledge required to provide the services recover hardware within agreed to time frames and use original spare parts also had a critical role to play
6860705 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
6860706 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
6860707 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
6860708 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
6860709 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
6860710 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
6860711 the reality is that the margin between a good university and a great university is generally private support and i believe we are moving toward becoming an outstanding university in a variety of our areas including the college of business and it the gift will hasten that development
6860712 today we celebrate a landmark moment in the history of this university and this community
6860713 we celebrate the dawn of a new era in which our college of business will have an unprecedented capacity to meet the educational needs of its students and to support the economic growth of our region we thank the carol ann and ralph v haile jr u s bank foundation for believing in our regions future and for placing its faith in nku as an instrument for advancing both individual and regional progress
6860714 nku is a beacon on the landscape of northern kentucky
6860715 this gift makes a bold statement and there is no more appropriate way to celebrate ralph hailes legacy than to endow and strengthen the resources of nku to create new generations of leadership for our region this is an investment in all of northern kentucky and it signals to the local business community and to decision makers across the commonwealth that our regions progress is inextricably linked to the growth and support of this university
6860716 ralph haile devoted much of his life to helping make northern kentucky a region that has not only prospered financially but also provided opportunity for all to have a brighter and more secure future
6860717 through this gift his influence will continue to be felt by both students and our region for generations

6860774 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff

6860776 he is an exceptional bowler who is certain to flummox opponents with his accuracy variety and trajectory
6860777 also one must give credit to murali since he maintains the pressure from the other end which is quite vital for any new bowler nevertheless mendis ought to make sure that he continues improving so that he doesn t become predictable
6860778 generally the carom ball is bowled with a tennis ball but mendis bowls it with the hard ball which is relatively tough and he ought to be given credit for it
6860779 even my googly is based on the carom ball as i bowled a lot of it with the tennis ball

6860801 global steel prices have already softened and if the trend continues it calls for a reduction in the domestic market too
6860802 due to fall in international steel prices the gap between domestic and international prices has declined as a result the pressure to increase the domestic steel price to bridge this gap has also declined
6860803 the decrease in international steel prices will have an impact on the domestic steel prices but it will not be immediate

6860808 it would mean a loss of the money spent on land and infrastructure development which is around rs 200 300 crore it is my understanding that the west bengal government would return the money that tatas paid for the land so there would be no loss there
6860809 there could be a downside in the balance sheet of tata motors which is already under strain because of the jaguar land rover acquisition so in this case times will be tougher for the company they may have to sell some of their investments to cover their loss if the exit from singur does happen
6860810 it is very unfortunate if they pull out the state will suffer a blow in terms of perception
6860811 we should make efforts so that the project remains in our state if tata motors exits then the image as well as the future growth of the state will be severely affected we will have to take an initiative to stop violence at the nano project site in singur
6860812 shifting of the nano project from singur will not only affect the industrialisation of west bengal it will have a cascading effect in other states as well
6860813 the development would irreversibly hamper the future industrialisation in west bengal and could take the state back to an age of industrial vacuum
6860814 we have already invested rs 90 crore out of rs 100 crore for setting up a unit for manufacturing the under carriage for nano

6860827 youd expect people to say that but i guess you have to know zack to know where hes coming from
6860828 he was at duke for four years and had a wonderful experience playing and going to school there but in his mind it was time to move on
6860829 i think it was a smart decision and the best decision for him in the end hes going to be able to get his business degree in one year from a pretty good business school thats a big deal for him
6860830 he practices hard and well every day he loves playing the game if he scored seven goals in a game and we lost hed be absolutely beside himself

6860833 more importantly it will introduce thousands of antique dealers to the thousands of homeowners who come to the worthpoint site daily looking to sell some of their possessions

6860840 could a mother forget her child but even if that were to happen god will never forget his people
6860841 personally i am totally convinced that he was a saint because of his great goodness simplicity humanity and courage
6860842 to have as pastor of the universal church a man of such goodness and luminous faith was a guarantee that everything was going well
6860843 speaking with him one perceived that he was an essential man he concentrated on the simple but was in no way simplistic
6860844 the vatican congregation has to do its work and of course that takes much time
6860845 it was not only the testimony of his goodness and joyous faith his unexpected death also opened the doors to an unexpected choice that of a pope who was not italian

6860847 shes done seminal work on christian feminism social justice and the relationship between religion and ecology
6860848 her public position and the symbol of this chair are in direct conflict
6860849 this chair is a powerful visible symbol of roman catholic theology and in roman catholic theology abortion is disallowed
6860850 chair holders are to be distinguished theologians who think from within the roman catholic tradition while exploring and expressing the tradition in contemporary contexts
6860851 this is a woman who is in favor of abortion in favor of contraception homosexuality and women priests
6860852 i mean how much more anti catholic can you get
6860853 as a catholic institution for higher education our understanding of ourselves is that we are to uphold the churchs teachings on abortion and other subjects as the holy father calls for
6860854 a national organization that works for catholic women to be priests and for a more inclusive roman catholic church
6860855 an arm of the abortion lobby in the united states and throughout the world
6860856 it appears to me that some right wing group has put pressure on the university
6860857 any appeal to the principle of academic freedom in order to justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church would obstruct or even betray the universitys identity and mission

6860880 i am delighted that dr buzzell has agreed to become our dean of theology

6860910 special jake i guessed at the point you were trying to make i dont think anyone including you is really sure what your point it 15 hrs ago
6860911 my question is if people arent showing up for work why are they still employed by the federal government
6860912 it is true that theres i think a certain lack of accountability in certain offices
6860913 so what do all those lost hours really mean well you can think of it as 10 000 work years not worked or an entire 30 year federal career for 316 workers that never happened

6860918 i dont know she seems more kind of accepting like this whole thing
6860919 a year or so ago i thought she was just going to bust but now she just seems all sort of serene
6860920 yes ive seen ashley really blossom over the last year shes really burned off a lot of stuff everyone just loves her shes like an angel
6860921 so what time do you guys meet i mean do we have to bring anything
6860922 its free we start around seven oclock or so just when everybody shows up you dont have to know anything or bring anything
6860923 youre welcome to come wed all love to see you
6860924 just come right in the west entrance we meet in the first classroom on the right
6860925 yes we are waiting for the other meditation group to get out
6860926 we dont want to disturb them they are still at it
6860927 i see im daniel roberts john invited me to come my wife has been coming for a year or so
6860928 im susan everyone just loves your wife its like we can all feel her energy lift us up when she enters the room youre a lucky guy
6860929 ill be right back i gotta point little percy at the porcelain
6860930 and this is our beautiful teacher who we are so fortunate to have
6860931 for those of you who are here for the first time im susan clark and this is our beginning meditation class we always like to start by introducing ourselves
6860932 i see some new faces so id like to begin by sort of giving you an idea of what we do here i dont know if youve meditated before or if youve done yoga or tai chi or anything like this before but the main thing you need to know is that its just learning how to get quiet and still it can be a spiritual or religious experience for you or it can just be a great healthful exercise that will improve your quality of life it doesnt matter were going to talk a lot about the energy or the light or the stream and all that is is the stuff that makes this world and everything in it alive you can think of this as god or jesus or buddha or whatever concept you feel comfortable with some people experience it as a radiant golden light or maybe a warm vibration or tingling or you may hear it or maybe you just imagine it and that it perfectly fine our teacher used to say that first you imagine it then you see it then you feel it then you know it so it is just fine to imagine it a radiant golden light
6860933 just to give you an idea of what were going to do let me just talk you through the basic exercises does anyone have any questions or comments about anything so far if it doesnt make sense to you right now its ok after we do this for awhile it will all just sort of fall into place
6860934 the first exercise is called running the energy and its just a great exercise for getting familiar with the energy
6860935 okay lets talk about how to sit to some folks it is really important to use the lotus position and keep the spine perfectly straight but most of us here in the u s are accustomed to sitting in chairs the important thing is that we create a closed circuit with our bodies this will help us at first to experience the energy by letting it build up in our bodies so cross you legs at your ankles then lay your hands palms down on your thighs lightly touching the tips of your index fingers with you the tips of your thumbs
6860936 now close your eyes start by taking a few deep breaths and try to fill your lungs from the bottom to the top with every breath let the tensions of the day just flow away just let go this is your time to spend with your divine self let all the worries and pressures of the day just float away as you breathe
6860937 take a moment to enjoy this feeling of relaxation anytime you feel stressed out during the day you can come back to this relaxed state by just taking a few minutes to let go lets begin the running of the energy exercise and we will do it three times take your attention to the top of your head just at the place of the babys soft spot the fontanel it is covered by thick bone now but this is where we are connected to the stream every second of the day this stream of golden light is pouring into you and filling you with life now imagine that you can somehow plug this hole try to stop the stream you may feel a tingling sensation or itching or pressure or warmth at the top of your head this is just like if you put your finger in a swift stream your finger is not stopping the stream but it is resisting it enough that you can feel the energy of the rushing water and now let the stream rush into you filling your brain with radiant golden light now imagine that you are gathering the light into a little ball and placing it behind your forehead right above the bridge of your nose this is the point of will or the will power center from here you can direct the light throughout your body and now holding the thought of cleansing or letting go move the light down the front of your face slowly i sometimes like to imagine that its like honey just oozing down my face and making everything it touches warm and tingly down your chin down your neck let it split across your shoulders down the top part of your arms down the lower part of your arms and into the palms of your hands try to focus the light into a pinpoint in your palms feel it get hot or tingly you can actually feel it there in the center of you palm
6860938 and now leaving the energy there in your hands draw your attention back to the top of your head let the light flow in gather it up take it to the point of will still holding the thought of cleansing let it wash back into your brain system filling every cell with light letting everything go allow it to gather at the brain stem and begin to go down your spine you may feel it stop as it reaches some tension or blockage just imagine that the energy is like crystal drano that just dissolves anything that blocks the flow or just simply ask that it be so at the base of the spine the light splits and flows into your thighs until it joins the energy in your hands allow it to flow down your legs to your feet and out into the earth just let it flow flow flow out of you down into the earth all of your worries and tensions and troubles just flow out and now take just a moment to say a word of gratitude in your own way for this energy its the unconditional love that flows freely from the source to all living things the christ light it is so lavishly poured over you and into you it is anointing you blessing you in every moment of your life
6860939 and now with a breath return your attention to the top of your head to start the process again again create the barrier to feel the stream for a moment then let it go allow it to pour into your brain gather up the light into a ball and bring to the point of will this time hold the thought of healing as you flow it through you allow it to touch any part of you that needs healing you dont have to tell it where it knows where to go
6860940 and now we will chant the word shanti which is the sanskrit word for peace as we chant it it will create a vibration of peace to flow through your spine and through your entire body allow yourself to resonate with the shanti
6860941 and now for our second exercise tonight listening in you may open your eyes so i can show you again how to do this exercise
6860942 we borrow this practice from the sikh tradition in india first you will take the first two fingers of your hands and place them gently over your eyelids elbows out then you will use your thumbs to plug up your ears now listen listen for any sound that you hear inside of you try to focus on a particular sound you may hear a ringing sound like a sustained bell or your heart beating or a deep rushing sound or crickets chirping or any number of sounds try to concentrate on one of them when your arms get tired bring them down then focus on any light that you see in your inner vision and try to become a part of it try to become one with the light if it helps you you may chant in your mind as you breath one inhale with the light exhale this part is meditation let your mind rest in the light we will do this three times each time i want you to try to listen a little deeper listen beyond the sounds you first hear
6860943 if you feel your mind wander just gently bring it back to your mantra or the light one with the light
6860944 and now become aware of this beautiful stream flowing into you connecting you with the source look up into this stream imagine that you are reaching up into it ask for the light to take you up further into the stream
6860945 up into the light if you like you can imagine that you are holding my hand as we go up together

6860971 e stata una buona giornata abbiamo lavorato bene e abbiamo raccolto tanti dati su questa nuova pista che ci serviranno nelle prossime ore per prepararci nella maniera migliore per questo fine settimana
6860972 per quanto abbiamo potuto vedere considerate le solite incognite del venerdi possiamo dire che siamo competitivi se lo saremo abbastanza per raggiungere il nostro obiettivo lo scopriremo solo a partire dalle qualifiche di domani pomeriggio
6860973 sono state due sessioni di prove libere divertenti con i tempi che scendevano con rapidita man mano che i piloti giravano e prendevano confidenza con il tracciato lasfalto e ancora molto sporco ed e facile commettere degli errori che fanno perdere decimi preziosi per fare un buon tempo devi essere prefetto mi piace la pista ce una bella atmosfera e devo dire che gli organizzatori hanno fatto un buon lavoro oggi era importante trovare subito un buon assetto di partenza e ci siamo riusciti
6860974 mi piace guidare su questa pista e diversa dai circuiti cittadini cui siamo abituati ieri quando ho fatto il circuito a piedi pensavo che sarebbe stato divertente e oggi ne ho avuto una conferma ci sono delle parti molto veloci quasi ovunque ce molto spazio direi che assomiglia forse ai circuiti nordamericani dove si correva una volta hanno fatto davvero un bel lavoro oggi abbiamo iniziato bene il weekend ma ovviamente e molto presto per dire dove siamo rispetto ai nostri avversari sorpassi sara difficile come sempre spero di non doverne avere bisogno e di mettermi nella migliore posizione in qualifica lassetto trovato oggi non e male ma sappiamo che ce ancora molto margine di miglioramento

6860995 we still believe that an agreement can be reached by the end of the year
6860996 but theres no attempt on the part of the u s government to push the parties beyond where they believe they can go the important thing here is that both sides have committed to trying to reach an agreement its in the best interest of both peoples its in the best interests of the united states and the rest of the international community
6860997 to do that well outside kiwisaver you would have to earn more than 36 per cent a year a return you are highly unlikely to receive even on a really high risk investment kiwisaver is a terrific deal for older people while the young can also do really well from it they wont get average effective returns nearly that high over the years why the young old difference ive written before about it but heres another way to look at it as long as you contribute at least 1043 a year the government will match that and in some cases you will also receive employer contributions in the early years in kiwisaver this extra money from others makes a huge difference to your returns lets say you have a kiwisaver account balance of 4000 and you make a 3 per cent return after fees and taxes which comes to 120 then along comes the government putting in a 1043 tax credit almost nine times your return and an employer might even add more for those over 60 or even 55 or so government and sometimes employer contributions will almost always completely overshadow ordinary investment returns every year

6861015 zanu pf is likely to back a candidate from mutambaras faction
6861016 zanu pf were initially prepared to back ncube but he said no
6861017 tsvangirais faction had however rejected the proposal of ncube as speaker preferring gibson sibanda
6861018 zanu pf is aware that a combined opposition vote will result in an mdc tsvangirai speaker and in a bid to divide the opposition they are backing nyathis candidacy so as to frustrate the mdc tsvangirai
6861019 the partys national council met on wednesday and endorsed paul themba nyathi as our speaker of parliament candidate and we believe as a smaller party in parliament we can provide a neutral speaker not from zanu pf or the mdc tsvangirai faction who will lead constructive debates

6861044 i think people elect presidents not vice presidents at the margin it might take a double digit victory for sen obama down into the high single digits
6861045 i dont think it has a sort of game changing context to new jersey and i suspect it might very well be offset by what sen lieberman would cost with some of the people who have strong views with regard to choice and the hard right elements of the republican party
6861046 im not even certain that im right that it would move him from what id think would be a double digit victory to high single

6861055 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6861056 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6861057 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6861058 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6861059 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6861060 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6861061 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6861062 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6861063 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6861064 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6861065 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6861066 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6861067 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6861068 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it

6861080 i like what im doing i think that given the opportunity to stay fixing the finances getting us into a position where were growing the economy and were not fighting a national recession where we are improving the education of our children and expanding health care doing the things i think the public would like to see in the long run ill be more than happy to have a few more years of this and go sit on the beach
6861081 i think its perfectly reasonable that people who want to position themselves if they were serious about running and they thought there was some small probability
6861082 theyre going to make a stand in showing respect for hillary and theyre going to make a stand behind barack obama to be the next president of the united states
6861083 there are always going to be in any political contest a few people at the margins that are not going to accept comfortably the outcome but the vast vast majority of people i know and i know the hillary campaign probably as well as anyone in the country are on board increasingly fired up
6861084 barack obama brought himself to the scene and jon corzine recognized when he was running for the senate that this was a very special person and the party should go out of its way to nurture the talent and the capacity that he has

6861089 its not the green light its the red light that bothers me
6861090 and if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore and because we have made this investment we will not move they are wrong because we would go whatever the cost
6861091 i am making a very genuine statement i dont have an ulterior motive i dont have a plan that im working to
6861092 i made a major investment here to move is going to be a great cost to the company and great cost to tata motors shareholders and i think its going to be a great cost to west bengal
6861093 if there is a view that for various political reasons that we should not be here or what we are trying to do should be altered which it cannot be then well necessarily face an issue very reluctantly where we would need to move
6861094 we dont want anybody to move out but at the same time we will not bow to any kind of pressure
6861095 this tatas withdrawing will create problems for the state not only in the present but also for future in attracting investment

6861113 at the moment i can not answer this question let this situation come first there is a meeting via teleconference on august 24 in which everything will be decided

6861120 its a full circle the soulful music era of 60s and 70s will be recreated soon in 80s and 90s the industry saw the growth of ghazals and disco dance numbers then came sufi songs so its time for melodious songs again
6861121 i wont comment on music directors like pritam or himmesh reshamiya who are popular but compose music keeping in mind the beats and tunes there are other like shankar mahadeven legendary a r rehman for who melody is still a priority songs of the film taare zameen par shows listeners still want to hear good songs

6861123 it is very difficult to predict natural as well as manmade disasters therefore constant vigilance is necessary and preparedness is all the more necessary
6861124 while there will be no shortage of funds the cooperation and coordination at various levels should be better than what we are doing now
6861125 we understand that the nsg will require more than one meeting to end indias nuclear isolation but seizing this moment is essential
6861126 todays meeting at the nsg just three weeks following the unanimous approval by the international atomic energy agency iaea is a crucial step that will bring india into the international mainstream which is good for nuclear nonproliferation good for global energy security and good for the environment
6861127 when matters are related to the emotions of the people we should try to solve them as quickly as possible i think we will be able to solve this matter in a very short time
6861128 that is exactly what we are trying to do and we would like to accept a formula which is acceptable to both people living in jammu and the people in kashmir
6861129 the meeting was positive many delegates raised some questions and the us is pleased with that i remain optimistic and we will continue to make progress
6861130 the nsg will meet again in the near future to work on these constructive discussions
6861131 i dont want to lie to you i cant really lie there might be some changes that we could accept but we are pushing for a clean text
6861132 the us and india will have to sit together and see what we can accommodate and what we cant we will have to talk to the other governments involved
6861133 bsp winning seats in municipal elections last year has not affected our strength they have not won any seats reserved for dalits they won some seats in the mcd because we were a little weak then
6861134 i see no threat from bsp and we are not disturbed by their rise they will not be able to pose any threat to our traditional vote bank
6861135 this is not going to help bsp i am confident that we will emerge victorious for the third consecutive term in the polls
6861136 it does not mean that bsp is powerful the fact was that congress was weak at that time now our party has strengthened itself

6861150 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
6861151 were reading a lot about the candidates and the media this election season but what are they reading
6861152 now you can track the news sites and blogs barack obama and john mccain read from drudge to the daily show and follow articles catching the eyes of leading political journalists
6861153 power readers in politics is obviously quite timely given the upcoming elections but launching similar efforts for other topics like sports and entertainment would be a great way for google reader to potentially find new audiences

6861158 i would like to draw your attention to the fact that along highway 1at the daniel interchange drivers report vegetation is being planted obviously this type of gardening work is strictly prohibited during the shmittah year not only does this planting work offend a large segment of the public both religious and traditional jews but carrying it out also blatantly tramples the mitzvah of shmittah which is very severe
6861159 i urge you to issue instructions to stop this work immediately and to see to it that the mitzvah of shmittah is not tread on in public view
6861160 derech eretz which operates highway 6 would like to make clear that it is not executing the planting work along highway 1 at the daniel interchange and never was involved in this work furthermore the work reported is not taking place in an area under derech eretzs charge derech eretz strictly observes the laws of shmittah and therefore postponed planting until after the conclusion of the shmittah year
6861161 he probably was confused as to which homes are in his name his wifes name or corporate names

6861174 was the only candidate to immediately release a tough statement criticizing the
6861175 ive opposed fisa for a long time and have said so even prior to written statements ive done it in speaking engagements ive done it repeatedly retroactive immunity is absolutely unacceptable im sorry if people have a hard time navigating my website but it was press released and thats just the way it goes
6861176 ive got the support of the campaign ive got the support of planned parenthood and alaska eight as a democratic leader and every single social issue that came up i fought hard for and fought on the right side of and so ive got a track record that has been battle tested and proven and any insinuation to the contrary is just its just campaign tactics and its just inaccurate the one other thing that i think is important to note is ive been right out front talking about the need to develop renewable energy and i did it when i was in the state legislature and i did it in the private sector i set up my own renewable energy company so this is something that i know a lot about im passionate about and its been a centerpiece of the campaign
6861177 id say go look at my fcc reports if i have any lobbyists money its from alaskan lobbyists and thats it and what theyre trying to do is draw linkage to the fact that ive had support from members of congress and from their leadership pacs and those leadership pacs i dont go solicit funds from them but to me when you have members of congress support you its an indication that they think youre gonna be an effective voice in congress so i think theyre making a whole lot of something out of nothing and its more in the line of sour grapes than anything else
6861178 ive spent three seasons in the antarctic and that was a pretty important thing as far as giving me personally something to talk about ive commercial fished and ive lived a good alaska life and so i appreciate that diane benson has an interesting life story theres a lot of americans who do shes not the only one
6861179 im looking forward to a long and fruitful discussion with you over many many years
6861180 blackburn rovers are delighted to announce that roque santa cruz has signed a new four year contract with the club running through until 2012
6861181 i dont think any player certainly not those two will be leaving
6861182 as a blackburn fan it would be a tragedy if they left so im sure the club wouldnt allow that
6861183 roque is a tremendous player as is benni we are a club that is trying to achieve things ourselves and you couldnt let brad friedel david bentley and roque santa cruz go in the same season theres no way the club will let that happen

6861192 the agency has determined that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment
6861193 it is unbelievable that the fdas first action on this issue is to turn to irradiation rather than focus on how to prevent contamination of these crops
6861194 instead of beefing up its capacity to inspect food facilities or test food for contamination all the fda has to offer consumers is an impractical ineffective and very expensive gimmick like irradiation
6861195 i think that from a growers perspective we have to consider anything that helps us provide safety for consumers but whether this takes off depends on consumers
6861196 in any marketing decision we have to look at cost in adapting the technology and consumer acceptance
6861197 its not something we have talked about in the year and a half we have had the marketing agreement in place
6861198 i do not know anyone clamoring for it there has to be consumer acceptance we do not know how big a hurdle that might be the science needs to be looked at and the cost too
6861199 its more of a safety net no matter how good a job you do with preventative steps good practices proper sanitation there is still a small chance for contamination this takes care of those small chances
6861200 and those products are ripe for using some kill step like irradiation to make it safer
6861201 she elevated the quality of life of these dogs above the safety of their neighbors
6861202 as we deepen our dialogue about our global interactions there is no better place than the united nations to commend these companies who have made it part of their common culture to understand and value diverse perspectives
6861203 they already have incorporated the kind of outlook needed to compete in the new economy and on the world stage
6861204 we are pleased that ushaa acknowledged our progress in the diversity arena with their highest award
6861205 a key competitive advantage for abbott is our people and the diversity of thought and cultural background they bring to the workplace we believe that diversity is a catalyst for innovative thinking and better ways of addressing evolving health needs to that end abbott remains committed to attracting selecting and retaining a high performing diverse workforce
6861206 to be recognized as one of the top hispanic companies in the country makes me and my family very proud
6861207 this country is an icon of capitalism which offers one of the ultimate forms of freedom the right of the individual to own private property and operate your own business it is a freedom that many take for granted but i dont because that right has not existed in my homeland of cuba for 49 years
6861208 i am humbled to be in the company of companies with such long and distinguished track records in their respective industries
6861209 the award in the context of the first global economic development summit has set a high standard for expectations to grow our companies in a manner that is inclusive and values diversity
6861210 we are honored to be a recipient of this years ushaa bravo award which recognizes our continued efforts to integrate diversity into all business practices including human resources procurement and market development
6861211 in his most extensive interview since the defcon controversy emerged

6861213 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival here
6861214 there has been no opportunity to put forward why he was innocent of those crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
6861215 he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
6861216 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
6861217 n o tivemos possibilidade de avaliar com muita anteced ncia a complexidade dos testes que amos fazer n s precisamos ter absoluta seguran a de que esse processo vai trazer benef cios sociedade e n o malef cios no nosso entendimento esse n vel de seguran a em setembro corre risco

6861227 that house he lives in is very quiet i assume he doesnt spend much time there
6861228 generally this is a nice quiet neighborhood but would having a vice presidential candidate on the street add excitement i would sure assume so i think a lot of people who love on this street dont even know chet edwards lives here

6861233 he probably was confused as to which homes are in his name his wifes name or corporate names
6861234 in his attempt to be honest he put his foot in his mouth
6861235 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and russia needs to come into compliance now
6861236 worth watching because they are making promising and innovative changes
6861237 i took two strokes and i was like this is not going to be good i just couldnt get the turnover
6861238 so long to get on she was worried she wouldnt have time after warm up to get it on she put it on too soon and over time it squished her
6861239 i did it and it was unfortunate but it happened
6861240 i started off really really well then i got scared because im not used to fencing so well i got excited and i started to lose focus
6861241 so much of pentathlon is learning how to mentally compose yourself im going to try to figure out what i need to do
6861242 its hard there is almost this guilt that i am sure you have as well being a mom you can never be there enough for your children you can never love them enough and thats the way it should be but when you are working its about balancing and planning your time
6861243 i do i am getting my body in really good shape i just lost over 40 pounds in the last 3 months im eating beautifully healthy is my new lifestyle

6861245 well the truck was blocking the lane and i tried to go around
6861246 it is your job to go around safely and if you cant then wait
6861247 ich habe schon oft gesagt dass ich erst am ende der saison oder im letzten teil der weltmeisterschaft ber n chstes jahr nachdenken werde im moment spreche ich mit niemandem daf r ist der zeitpunkt nicht richtig ich konzentriere mich voll auf die weltmeisterschaft es w re ein fehler so fr h an n chstes jahr zu denken
6861248 das ist unsere mission f r die zukunft das versucht jeder teammanager f r seinen fahrer oder
6861249 was denkst du ber die strecke die sicherheit und m glichkeiten zum berholen
6861250 eine neue strecke ist f r alle eine herausforderung besonders im ersten freien training einige fahrer haben sich mit simulatoren und diesen dingen etwas mehr vorbereitet als andere aber so oder so ben tigt man drei oder vier runden um zu lernen wo es langgeht und in bezug auf das bremsen ist es nicht einfach
6861251 es gibt drei oder vier sehr lange geraden an deren ende man stark bremsen muss in bezug auf dieses gebiet ist es eine sehr anspruchsvolle strecke ich habe das gef hl dass ich ein paar hochgeschwindigkeitskurven vermisse im letzten sektor gibt es ein paar schnelle kurven aber man kann sie leicht voll fahren es ist also eine stop and go strecke was gut f r mich ist
6861252 ja man hat in hockenheim mit der haarnadelkurve in kurve f nf gesehen dass wenn man nach einer sehr langen gerade sehr stark bremsen muss man m glichkeiten zum berholen hat meiner meinung nach vermissen alle das berholen in der formel 1 in valencia haben wir an zwei vielleicht an drei stellen m glichkeiten es ist ziemlich schwierig wenn du dieselbe geschwindigkeit hast oder nur ein bisschen schneller bist wenn der andere keinen fehler macht
6861253 welche stellen der strecke magst du am meisten und welche teile sind f r dich am herausforderndsten
6861254 ich mag strecken wie diese da es eine menge harter bremsman ver gibt das bremsen in die letzte kurve ist angesichts der querbeschleunigung ziemlich interessant man f hrt aus der kurve in die kurve und muss eine gute linie ber die randsteine w hlen was ziemlich nett ist das erste bremsman vern ist ziemlich schwierig und auch jenes in die 12 kurve das ist auch ein sehr gutes bremsman ver
6861255 im hinblick auf das morgige qualifying welche kurven und welche stellen der strecke werden deiner meinung nach entscheidend sein wenn es darum geht die entscheidenden paar zehntelsekunden herauszuholen die man ben tigen k nnte um vor den gegnern zu stehen was ist mit den reifen es schien als sei heute der unterschied zwischen dem harten und dem weichen reifen nicht besonders gro gewesen ist das auch das gef hl das du hast wenn es um die leistung auf einer runde geht
6861256 es ist schwierig die reifen zu bewerten denn alle 20 minuten oder halbe stunde f hlt sich das auto besser an wenn du einen neuen versuch unternimmst die strecke hat mehr gummi aufgenommen und sie wird schneller und schneller aber der weichere reifen verleiht immer ein wenig mehr haftung als der h rtere reifen wom glich ist der unterschied hier angesichts der unterschiedlichen haftung viel gr er als gew hnlich
6861257 ich gehe jedoch davon aus dass der unterschied im qualifying morgen wie immer sein wird einfach ein paar zehntelsekunden was die qualifying runde betrifft denke ich dass es auf jeder strecke dasselbe ist man muss alles hinbekommen um eine so gute wie nur m gliche runde zu fahren man kann immer berall schneller sein ich glaube also nicht dass man eine perfekte runde fahren kann man kann sich berall etwas verbessern und erst danach wei man ob man an bestimmten stellen etwas schneller h tte fahren k nnen oder nicht aber da ist die runde schon gefahren es ist ein kompromiss zwischen dem gef hl und der erfahrung aus dem freien training
6861258 hast du nach wie vor das gef hl dass der kampf um den titel zwischen drei fahrern stattfindet
6861259 meiner meinung nach habe ich mich nach kanada in der fahrer wertung in einer besseren position befunden ungl cklicherweise mangelte es uns in den vergangenen drei oder vier rennen im vergleich zu ferrari und mclaren etwas an geschwindigkeit zudem haben sich renault und toyota ziemlich stark verbessert
6861260 in hockenheim wurde mein rennen durch das safety car ruiniert als ich auf dem vierten rang fuhr was f r mich mit einer guten geschwindigkeit eine sehr gute position war in ungarn war die geschwindigkeit jedoch etwas weniger konkurrenzf hig als zu beginn der saison
6861261 am anfang des jahres war es viel einfacher gegen ferrari und mclaren zu k mpfen nun bekommen wir es mit renault und toyota zu tun aber das team arbeitet und wir werden schauen wie die ergebnisse in den kommenden paar rennen aussehen werden
6861262 the good news is that the aid seems to be unhindered it gets here we get the food we get the help but the bad news is that civilian protection does not exist

6861268 extraordinarily lifelike characters are to begin appearing in films and computer games thanks to a new type of animation technology emily the woman in the above animation was produced using a new modeling technology that enables the most minute details of a facial expression to be captured and recreated she is considered to be one of the first animations to have overleapt a long standing barrier known as uncanny valley which refers to the perception that animation looks less realistic as it approaches human likeness
6861269 ultimately we intend to be a full service global photo agency with a web site that will be a primary destination for art buyers seeking high quality commercial and editorial photographers we expect to max out at 50 cities in north america by the end of the year then expand to other major markets around the world we will have a select number of photographers in each location and no two alike though we will be as exclusive as possible with the photographers we choose we will not require that our photographers work with us exclusively striking the right balance in quality quantity specialty and geography will make us a logical first stop for clients weve created a business model that is unique in the industry and its one that we think will provide our photographers with the best possible bang for their marketing buck its a hybrid combining elements of a web portal with those of full service artist representation what makes us different from other portals is we have a limited number of photographers in each city specialty so your name will always stand out we maintain a high standard of talent so your photography will only be associated with other good work your photography will be actively promoted to a wide range of qualified prospects we can assist you with estimating production and other consulting services

6861279 a 30 year civil war driven by ethnic rivalries has claimed an estimated 70 000 lives in the island nation and sparked an exodus that has turned toronto into a key front where the tigers hope to elicit support in the continuing battle for a separate homeland
6861280 canada and several other western governments have recently blacklisted the liberation tigers of tamil eelam as a terrorist group but the focus of many toronto tamils is on alleged acts of

6861292 the tigers drive toward an independent state has lately lost momentum mr selliah points out those sri lankan military campaigns have reduced tiger held sri lanka to a rump of 300 000 residents in the northern jungle regions
6861293 toronto now has more than 200 000 tamils yet it is getting a lot harder to turn sympathy for the independence movement into possible material support for the tamil tigers
6861294 we owe it to the memory of our four colleagues to carry on

6861320 to coincide with the electronica revolution of the late 90s bill laswell remixed a number of bob marley records as ambient dub for the dreams of freedom ambient translations of bob marley in dub album if these songs were remixed by any other producer the results could have been disastrous but laswell is one of the masters of intellectual dub he knows what to take out and what to add creating a spacious cavernous mix that is provocative without being extreme some longtime marley fans will balk at the very idea of the album but the results are undeniably impressive even if its a little too restrained and cerebral to qualify as first rate ambient dub for clubs

6861383 he was throwing pitches on both sides of the plate for strikes
6861384 he was very confident with his pitches threw a lot of pitches for strikes and came right after the hitters
6861385 he was up on the mound and ready to go quickly he was coming after the hitters and trying to get ahead on every pitch its easy to call a game in that situation
6861386 he had good life on his fastball and was throwing a lot of sinkers up there and getting a lot of groundball outs

6861393 broward public defender howard finkelstein said andrews was one of the first judges he practiced before when he was assigned to his courtroom as a young attorney he said his retirement is a great loss for the broward judiciary
6861394 judge andrews is that rare combination of brilliant legal mind while still having his feet firmly on the ground as one of the everyday people
6861395 he understands what was truly important and didnt get pulled into the cacophony of public opinion but rather did the right thing for the right reason and damn the consequences

6861409 t he 2004 presidential contest between democratic challenger senator john kerry and the incumbent president george w bush amounted to another stolen election some 105 million citizens voted in 2000 but in 2004 the turnout climbed to at least 122 million pre election surveys indicated that among the record 16 8 million new voters kerry was a heavy favorite a fact that went largely unreported by the press in addition there were about two million progressives who had voted for ralph nader in 2000 who switched to kerry in 2004 yet the official 2004 tallies showed bush jr with 62 million votes about 11 6 million more than he got in 2000 meanwhile kerry showed only eight million more votes than gore received in 2000 to have achieved his remarkable 2004 tally bush would needed to have kept all his 50 4 million from 2000 plus a majority of the new voters plus a large share of the very liberal nader defectors nothing in the campaign and in the opinion polls suggest such a mass crossover the numbers simply do not add up
6861410 in some places large numbers of democratic registration forms disappeared along with absentee ballots and provisional ballots sometimes absentee ballots were mailed out to voters just before election day too late to be returned on time or they were never mailed at all overseas ballots normally reliably distributed by the state department were for some reason distributed by the pentagon in 2004 nearly half of the six million american voters living abroad a noticeable number of whom formed anti bush organizations never received their ballots or got them too late to vote military personnel usually more inclined toward supporting the president encountered no such problems with their overseas ballots
6861411 the issue returned to prominence in 2004 when florida announced another planned purge again based on a list of felons
6861412 the 2004 election brought new attention to the issue of exit polls which are generally considered more reliable than pre election opinion polls
6861413 the size of the average exit poll error was higher in 2004 than in previous years for which we have data
6861414 most likely due to kerry voters participating in the exit polls at a higher rate than bush voters
6861415 the trouble began last year when sancho allowed a finnish computer scientist to test leon countys diebold voting machines a common type that uses an optical scanner to count votes from ballots that voters have marked diebold election systems is one of the largest voting machine companies in the united states while some tests showed that the system is resistant to outside attack others showed that elections workers could alter the vote tallies by manipulating the removable memory cards in the voting machines and do so without detection

6861417 the l tryptophan food supplement tragedy in which thousands of americans suffered severe pain and other seriously debilitating effects from 1989 onwards and some died because of the presence of unidentified toxins in very low levels in a gm version of the supplement the cause was never proven but the circumstances point to the gm origin as the most probable cause novel toxins are one of the serious concerns of gmos and gm derivatives it is possible that other gm foods and supplements pose similar risks current safety assessment procedures do not eliminate these health risks as gm foods are only tested for known toxins supplements are also not normally tested for contaminants at very low levels
6861418 the l tryptophan had highly debilitating effects bringing intense pain and a range of other symptoms which turned the sufferers lives upside down many were bed ridden from the pain the worst cases were crippled by ascending paralysis increasingly losing control of their limbs and body and eventually requiring a respirator to breathe patients were characterised by an extremely high white blood cell eosinophils count hence the name given to the illness eosinophilia myalgia syndrome ems this count is usually about 10 per cubic cm or 200 to 400 in allergy or asthma suffers ems victims had counts of 10 000 to 58 000
6861419 it is often claimed that a us government decision on the cause of the toxic effects could not be made because all relevant evidence in showa denkos laboratory was destroyed before it could be examined

6861428 far from acting as a catalyst for reform the authorities have used beijings hosting of the olympics as a pretext for extending the use of punitive administrative detention notably
6861429 jeff hunter group operations director for sportsworld the official travel and ticket agent for the british olympic association said
6861430 mr edwards alexander hitchen from the national enquirer would you like to say why you were at the hotel this evening to see your mistress rielle hunter and your love child
6861431 do you think for the sake of your child you should admit paternity
6861432 it is not circumstances that cause a catastrophy its how you handle them

6861441 something unknown is doing we dont know what when we pray
6861442 when we have been in touch with the ultimate dimension then wheter our temple or our practice center burns down whether people smear our reputation are jealous of us or accuse us unjustly we can still smile and be peaceful and joyful
6861443 how hot are the daughters of my favorite mma stars
6861444 the fortune teller told me that if i will change my name i will win the gold
6861445 some people believe in fortune tellers and i am one of them so i followed her advice
6861446 i had an injury at the world championships after that i focused on the clean and jerk i practised hard in my training camp and my goal for the olympics is the gold medal
6861447 i dont care that i failed to break the world record anything could happen during the competition
6861448 i just want to win a medal whether it is gold silver or bronze
6861449 you know i have been preparing for the olympics from three years and never went back home
6861450 i was lucky the chinese did not enter a lifter in the 53kg
6861451 were doing a documentary for a local broadcasting station on whatever interesting things we encounter here
6861452 is there really much pollution are there more squat toilets or sit down toilets
6861453 travel experience work experience passion for writing passion for sports we came here for different things but for most people its a combination of them
6861454 il giorno che lavrebbero ucciso santiago nasar si alz alle 5 30 del mattino per andare ad aspettare il battello con cui arrivava il vescovo aveva sognato di attraversare il bosco di higuerones sotto una pioggerella tenera e per un istante fu felice dentro il sogno ma nel ridestarsi si sent inzaccherato da capo a piedi di cacca duccelli
6861455 if getting a college education makes me elite if being elected to the senate makes me elite then id like to promise every child in america the chance to join such an elite
6861456 if being liberal means extreme left wing views then no but if being liberal means adopting policies that start and end with you the american people then im proud to be that kind of liberal
6861457 obama wont admit the surge is working obama doesnt want to win the war
6861458 the bush mccain approach is to keep lowering and changing their definition of victory rather than to define what our goals should be
6861459 talking about this quagmire in terms of win or lose is a simplistic approach we arent fighting against a nation with a leader who can officially represent a country or who will one day officially announce a surrender were fighting against shadowy insurgents and terrorists with no central leader and no real agenda except destruction this war is not a footrace in the olympics with a single clear winner we must take a more thoughtful approach
6861460 i will make it harder for companies to go overseas i will make it easier for them to stay here i will make it easier to get retraining and easier for companies to relocate in areas in economic difficulty
6861461 its not a question of whether my heart is true
6861462 in the living rooms in the coffee shops its going to be the hottest topic for the next several weeks
6861463 whether i win or lose the impeachment this country will be defeated
6861464 i dont know if there is a jubilation in the community
6861465 or if there is more of a concern now about the future stability of pakistan
6861466 all dictators meet such a fate he should not be spared for his misdeeds
6861467 he should face the courts and should be tried for abrogating the constitution and for his anti democratic acts
6861468 if musharrafs done anything wrong he should be brought to justice
6861469 but if theyre just doing it for the sake of doing it that is not helping the country move forward its not helping the people or the future of pakistan
6861470 lets get more interested in our country as chinese citizens and may our country become much stronger
6861471 if someone asks me whether im a chinese or hong kongner i would answer that im a chinese
6861472 im very proud that im allowed to raise the national flag as a representative of this school
6861473 its impossible to talk about the change without referring to the patriotic education at school such as flag raising ceremonies at school
6861474 yeah it was a typo its going for 7 or 8 grand

6861481 theyre trying to do everything to make themselves look like a real woman
6861482 why cant they forget about the external beauty and look inside
6861483 people are stupid and talk about things they know nothing about these activists are hurting transgendered people

6861488 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
6861489 im just an artist all i do is paint pretty pictures and sometimes when i go someplace and the asian kids recognize me they project all their hopes and dreams on me like i was the next coming of bruce lee like im a role model and i start to get stressed out im just an artist obama might soon be the most powerful man in the world thats heavy im not really a political person but our country is in such a mess and if obama gets elected next i cant even believe the pressure this guys gonna be under hes gotta carry the weight of the world on his shoulders and lead the entire nation millions will look up to him while others will look down on him under close scrutiny this society we live in just waits for people to fall so they can point and laugh at our imperfections on late night tv so i was looking at this newspaper of a profile of obamas head and looking at a globe in my room and i was thinking of an atlas kind of image with obama carrying the world on his shoulders hes gonna have to become like a superhero to get us through this but this battle is not so much physical in that its more mental it was late at night and my eyes were getting kind of blurry and i noticed florida all the way to the bottom tip of texas on my globe looked like they followed obamas hairline on his side profile i sketched out obama on the computer and put a map of the u s around his head and it fit perfectly america with all its ills and beauty with all its economic racial religious and political problems weighing heavy on obamas mind but for the first time in a very long time there seems like theres hope

6861492 an influx of litigation and complaints which are unreasonable and unnecessary and would hamper efficient administration
6861493 women reported feeling anxious about their own and other peoples safety using all forms of transport and many experience travel as a source of conflict stress or danger
6861494 although these women travel every day many felt quite intimidated
6861495 i feel that our country is run by a bunch of morons
6861496 o esporte serve para tirar a crian a da rua
6861497 marigrace is gone we will never find her at the bottom of all that water it is too late
6861498 we think this bodes well for improved gross margins for the rest of the year
6861499 we continue to believe that verasun represents one of the best domestic ethanol operators and has the ability to weather short term volatility better than most other producers
6861500 their scale and footprint should allow them to achieve efficiencies that smaller or more disperse operators will be unable to capitalize on
6861501 we see no political pressures in the near term that would increase ethanol prices to maintain healthy crush margins
6861502 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6861503 the big advantage of administering cannabis via a pill is that the drug is adopted easier by the body compared to alternatives
6861504 i am proud to announce canada will contribute more than 100 million to the cancer stem cell consortium which will work with the california institute for regenerative medicine cirm in this exciting new partnership
6861505 now we are working together across borders bringing together the best minds from both countries with the goal of learning how to prevent and treat cancer for the benefit of all of our citizens
6861506 california is committed to being a leader in stem cell research but no one state or nation should do this alone
6861507 entering into collaborations such as this has great potential in improving the lives of not only californians but people around the world
6861508 assistance in obtaining information which is vital in strengthening evidence for the filing of tax cases against the aformentioned chingkoe spouses
6861509 we have information that part of the proceeds of the illegal sale of the fraudulently obtained tax credit certificates were diverted by the spouses chingkoe to canada and were used by them to fund certain business transactions and to purchase properties in the same foreign state
6861510 tax laws can be used to extradite people and they have been
6861511 he was escorted by the rcmp and hes now in jail here
6861512 the offensive against faustino and gloria is a good sign that somehow the philippine government is doing something at last
6861513 whether or not the tax treaty extradition will go places is something we will just pray for
6861514 if proven they did not pay the correct taxes then the canadian government should file a tax evasion case against them also
6861515 it sounds like a clear cut case of disguised extradition to me
6861516 as long as canada and the philippines have an extant extradition treaty however flawed extradition should be the vehicle to be used in sending alleged criminals back to face justice
6861517 we believe there remains upside to our fourth quarter estimates if commodities stay where they are or fall further

6861519 mental illness is a growing problem worldwide and the management of anxiety and depression generally falls to family doctors who may lack the time and resources to deliver appropriate psychological treatment to their patients
6861520 so other methods for delivering effective therapy need to be developed
6861521 i will keep on doing the business and hopefully develop adam amp eve into a famous and long standing brand
6861522 no one has opened such a shop in china it was totally risky both commercially and culturally
6861523 sex is a normal thing just like when you feel thirsty you drink water why should we shy away from our basic needs
6861524 the opening of the adult shop could suggest to the public that sex was a natural thing instead of a dirty taboo
6861525 i was so excited to see what would happen next like a student waiting for their exam result
6861526 overnight i became a celebrity some said i was a liberator and pioneer and some accused me of being nasty i just placed myself as a different businessman
6861527 if i had filmed all the customers the documentary would present dramatic changes of peoples attitudes over the past 15 years
6861528 one of the best investments of your time and money is to increase your earning ability
6861529 what are the potential consequences of doing or not doing this task
6861530 which one project or activity if i did it in an excellent and timely fashion would have the greatest positive impact on my life
6861531 we are working to find responsible solutions meeting the needs of the port and its neighbours
6861532 these lng trucks will help support our goal that by the year 2020 the port of oakland will have cut the health risk from diesel particulate matter at our seaport by 85
6861533 to provide practical and commercially viable alternative fuel based solutions
6861534 trucks transport virtually 100 of groceries medicine clothing appliances and even the fuel thats pumped at the local gas station diesel fuel prices are hurting us and driving up the costs of all of these consumer goods we need a comprehensive energy plan the national conservation environment and energy independence act is part of this comprehensive solution
6861535 petroleums high price is not only straining family budgets at the pump
6861536 its driving up the price of groceries and basic household goods because truckers are paying three times more for diesel than they did four years ago this plan is a comprehensive energy solution that includes domestic drilling and alternative energy research it will resolve the crisis american families are facing

6861543 although a younger workers total accrued benefit at retirement age will be greater under the cash balance formula than an older workers if both started working at the same time the difference is due to the time value of money rather than age discrimination
6861544 plaintiffs argument ignores the realities of the time value of money
6861545 given the universal conclusion reached by all courts of appeal notwithstanding their diverse political leanings this challenge should now be buried once and for all
6861546 maybe some companies are thinking they cant anticipate whats going to happen so they will just address issues as they arise
6861547 but its hard for me to believe that any business could think that they would not be subject to the volatility of the market
6861548 if they are not planning during bad times i doubt that they are planning in general about what their workforce needs are going to be in the future
6861549 if you are in a country like thailand you have dealt with currency crises and coups which have really affected companies
6861550 having contingency plans could be part of companies agreements with their unions

6861554 but xiamen is much more than just a business destination
6861555 piano and string instruments like the cello and the violin are very popular here
6861556 most people here play the piano at leisure almost every family in the gulangiu island has a pianist and xiamen hosts at least 10 piano concerts every year featuring american german and local piano sensations like ying cheng zhon who comes home from the u s every four or five years to take part in concertos

6861576 m y pain was more than just physical the keating five savings and loan scandal had just blown up and my husband was implicated i became a focus of the investigation when i couldnt find receipts showing that john and i had reimbursed the keatings for a vacation we took to the bahamas the first time i ever heard of the keating five i was in the hospital recovering from my first back surgery a resident came in threw a newspaper down on my bed and said gee i guess your husbands not so perfect after all throughout the investigation the painkillers cushioned me the newspaper articles didnt hurt as much and i didnt hurt as much i can remember sitting in the senate hearings listening to howell heflin saying terrible things not just about my husband but about me the pills made me feel euphoric and free
6861577 its just in the beginning phases but i can definitely see how that is going to become a chapter in the very near future
6861578 theres too much going on in central oregon to not have some sort of centralized voice

6861588 integrated approach will make them an even more vital partner in moving our brand forward
6861589 popeyes is a great brand with a long tradition of serving a unique quality product
6861590 were proud to be their partner in growing their business and were honored theyve entrusted us with these expanded responsibilities
6861591 integrated approach will make them an even more vital partner in moving our brand forward

6861593 were proud to be their partner in growing their business and were honored theyve entrusted us with these expanded responsibilities

6861597 this is a form of evil we have yet to see in this planet
6861598 i really miss doing as many interviews as i used to
6861599 i think theres something about the web vibe and i know that makes me sound very out of it to use the word vibe but im looking forward to being able to have more casual but hopefully hard hitting coverage if thats not too counter intuitive
6861600 a distinct venue to mix good food and lively political debate
6861601 its very ambitious and a huge commitment of resources i dont think by the end of fall anybody will be able to say cbs just talked about the polls and the candidates latest gaffes
6861602 talking to real people is one of my strong suits and hopefully this gives me a chance to get out its frustrating sometimes to be behind the desk all the time and not interacting with people and talking to them making people comfortable and guiding the interview and being a good listener
6861603 this will be an opportunity to do some of that
6861604 unknown political risk and constant negative headlines are not likely to induce investors to buy
6861605 we were concerned that the declining oil price and the mechel case would put pressure on the margins of companies and hence their earnings
6861606 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
6861607 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated political risk may be rewarded
6861608 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies
6861609 we believe the long term investment case for russia is compelling
6861610 oh that would make great paper oh that is a great color scheme
6861611 oh i should take a picture of that it would make a great texture

6861614 the young yips are giving up their saturday night to come to this reunion
6861615 each generation has a different colour so you can see what generation you belong to
6861616 my nephew in ottawa has computerized the whole thing in technicolor and so right now were printing out a 2008 family tree covering six generations
6861617 but it would be interesting to see if we shared the same lineage
6861618 when i bought the building in 2004 grace sent me a picture of their reunion that took place in 1996 and so i told her that i would like them to use it first for another reunion
6861619 we hoped the building would be finished but because of the intricacies of saving a heritage building its only 75 per cent finished
6861620 i think chinatown is such an amazing few blocks that it needs balance brought back
6861621 the building has a huge responsibility to the community which i did not take lightly there is still the downtown eastside that is trying to figure itself out and thats not going to change right away but we want to start bringing some balance to the area
6861622 in 1864 at age 19 yip sailed from china to california where he worked as a dishwasher and a cook seventeen years later he came to vancouver where he settled in chinatown in 1881
6861623 in 1882 he was employed by the canadian pacific railroad supply company where he worked as a bookkeeper timekeeper paymaster and then as the chinese superintendent
6861624 were just trying to paint the picture of why grandfather had four wives and what the traditions were in the house and the family
6861625 i say luck is when an opportunity comes along and youre prepared for it

6861628 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6861629 would you want to know if the most horrific attack on your country was perpatrated by its own government would you really want to know
6861630 made by the wachowski brothers and joel silver of matrix fame
6861631 we can be sure that the wachowski brothers were referencing the order out of chaos system since at one point in the film the opressive english parliment gets frustrated that their society is embracing the terrorist acts against them and decides to begin committing terrorist acts under the guise of v in order to turn the people against him and again embrace their oppressive form of government police state they even unleash a biological virus on their people in the film killing almost 100 000 people and if the history of terrorism in literature and cinema is any indicator you should probably mind your hygeine habits in the coming years because as exhibited below several times in recent years terrorist acts have been depicted almost exactly as they go down in entertainment sold to us beforehand
6861632 as for anyone who scoffs at the notion that government connected interests could be planting depictions of terrorism in hollywood that isnt the allegation the more realistic notion is that such interests have been made privy to certain plotlines and then decide to preempt them in real life to affect how you see their portrayal upon release of the entertainment material
6861633 but perhaps that is the desired goal by the powers that be to push americans until they fight back and really give you a pretext to lay on the police state thick since the outcome of another staged attack like 9 11 really cannot be gauged considering the growth in the population who are not so sure 9 11 is what they thought it was anymore if an attack were to occur tomorrow i dont believe theyre certain they can sell us on their version of it and i believe that scares them
6861634 i am the world trade center out of the loop
6861635 heavy metal had come full circle to the point where it was simultaneously riven by so many new categories and subgenres that you needed an encyclopedia to make sense of it all and yet it was more universally popular than ever before
6861636 because on the average humans really cant fly fly not in the bird sense fly at least by way of planes or other flying machines yes but no not fly fly
6861637 lets make a deal for now lets just say maybe you can or maybe you cant if one day you are able to fly tell me about it and if one day you realize you cant tell me anyway okay
6861638 but if i get to fly away then how am i gonna tell you about it eh im gone na nga
6861639 its just something you say when you think the answer sounds right
6861640 if you can win you should win and get to work doing the poeples business

6861856 the good fight is the one we fight because our heart asks it of us in heroic ages at the time of the knights in armor this was easy there was lands to conquer and much to do today though the world had changed a lot and the good fight has shifted from the battlefields to the fields within ouselves the good fight is the one thats fought in the name of our dreams when were young and our dreams first explode inside us with all of their force we are very courageous but we havent yet learned how to fight with great effort we learn how to fight but by then we no longer have the courage to go into combat so we turn against ourselves and do battle within we become our own worst enemy we say that our dreams were childish or too difficult to realize or the result of our not having known enough about life we kill our dreams because we are afraid to fight the good fight the first symptom of the process of our killing our dreams is the lack of time the busiest people i have known in my life always have time enough to do everything those who do nothing are always tired and pay no attention to the little amount of work they are required to do they complain constantly that the day is too short the truth is they are afraid to fight the good fight the second symptom of the death of our dreams lies in our certainties because we dont want to see life as a grand adventure we begin to think of ourselves as wise and faire and correct in asking so little of life we look beyond the walls of our day to day existence and we hear the sound of lances breaking we smell the dust and the sweat and we see the great defeats and the fire in the eyes of the warriors but we never see the delight the immense delight in the hearts of those who are engaged in the battle for them neither victory nor defeat is important whats important is only that they are fighting the good fight and finally the third symptom of the passing of our dreams is peace life becomes a saunday afternoon we ask for nothing grand and we cease to demand anymore more than we are willing to give in that state we think of ourselves as being mature we put aside the fantasies of our youth and we seek personal and profesional achievement we are surprised when people our age say that they still want this or that out of life but really deep in our hearts we know that what has happened is that we have renounced the battle for our dreams we have refused to fight the good fight when we renounce our dream and find peace we go though a short period of tranquility but the dead dreams begin to rot within us and infect our entire being we become cruel to those around us and then we begin to direct this cruelty against ourselves thats when illneses and psychoses arise what we sought to avoid in combat disappointment and defeat came upon us because of our cowardice and one day the dead spoiled dreams make it difficult to breathe and we actually seek death its death that frees us from certainties from our work and from that terrible peace of our sundays afternoons

6861921 the major benefit of ddr3 metasdram technology is that it enables this larger memory capacity without negatively impacting the operating frequency of the ddr3 memory channel like standard r dimms
6861922 it is the only technology that has been shown publicly to run 24gb of ddr3 sdram in a channel at 1066 million transactions per second mt s
6861923 using three 16gb dimm modules users can achieve 48gb per channel while other cost effective solutions max out at 16gb per channel
6861924 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
6861925 these abstinence only interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
6861926 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
6861927 raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
6861928 are arriving in emergency departments with serious and sometimes fatal injuries because they were not paying attention while texting
6861929 people are texting and they trip and fall on their faces usually people in their 20s we see a lot of face chin mouth and eye injuries from falls
6861930 some people are actually on chicagos busy lakefront path texting while walking or exercising we see people rollerblading or biking while texting they are usually very skilled but sometimes crash and fall when they are not watching where they are going
6861931 in march we were driving and saw a woman in her 20s step off the curb and get struck square by a pickup truck she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury
6861932 you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying
6861933 most people do not think that young people have strokes
6861934 but the point people should really understand is that they can occur in utero they can occur in the neonatal period and they can occur in older children there are noticeable differences in presentation risk factors and the prognosis in children compared to older adults however
6861935 people are like kids dont have strokes so i still think theres a lot of work to be done in terms of awareness
6861936 the prognosis at the beginning wasnt very good eighty five to 90 percent of the brain tissue on his left side is gone the doctors thought hed be in a wheelchair that hed never be able to walk or talk he struggles a bit and it may take him a little longer but he does it all now
6861937 kids reject the bad taste of medicine because its basic biology their system is designed to reject that taste because many toxic substances are bitter and distasteful
6861938 our basic biology is telling us to reject bitter that its poison were really designed to reject this stuff
6861939 when it comes to many of the senses childhood is a time of heightened sensitivity the preference for sweet and salt starts shifting in adolescence
6861940 i would caution those who make medicines not to make them so palatable that kids think theyre candy
6861941 my favorite trick is chocolate syrup before and after the medicine
6861942 a lot of times children refuse a food and parents give in and dont offer it again but parents need to persevere and offer the foods again repeated exposure may help
6861943 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6861944 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of
6861945 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6861946 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6861947 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6861948 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6861949 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today
6861950 are small and could have occurred as a result of chance
6861951 we believe that the findings in seas on cancer are likely to be an anomaly
6861952 we dont believe in light of all the data that theres an association of cancer with vytorin
6861953 when you put all of the information together there is no evidence that
6861954 early communication about an ongoing safety review of ezetimibe simvastatin marketed as vytorin simvastatin marketed as zocor and ezetimibe marketed as zetia fda investigates a report from the seas trial
6861955 every year we experience importation of measles from other countries and from those going abroad but this year is different once measles is imported here were seeing it spread to many more people
6861956 many cases are in children who are eligible for vaccination but who have not been immunized because of parents decisions
6861957 we need very high levels of population immunity approximately 95 percent
6861958 we have been lucky to have low levels of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases but children can still get measles and can still spread measles including to those too young to be immunized and those who cant be vaccinated because of medical reasons
6861959 its important in this country to maintain high levels of vaccination that have been so successful in limiting measles to relatively low numbers over the last decade we would like to remind parents as their children go back to school whether or not they attend in schools or are home schooled or attend day care this is a good time to be considering their vaccination status for measles to protect them from acquiring this disease
6861960 this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
6861961 typically its the undecided voter that gives politicians a hard time its the undecided voters that you need to get
6861962 this study shows that by using these measures there is some potential for improving the prediction of election outcomes
6861963 the inspiration for this study came from the development of a particular class of measures that enables us to assess these automatic mental associations
6861964 over the past couple of years a lot of research has shown that these measures are able to predict behaviors that psychologists have had a hard time predicting with standard methodology or self report
6861965 this type of measure in the domain of prejudice and stereotyping has found that in north america there is a large proportion of individuals with relatively negative views of african americans even people who hold very strong egalitarian opinions or beliefs sometimes show negative associations
6861966 this can influence their voting behavior particularly for undecided voters in a way that they may not be aware of
6861967 we know that there is still a strong prevalence of automatic negative associations regarding african americans and this may have distorted peoples perception of the political process public debates etc
6861968 theyve made up their mind who theyre going to vote for even though theyre undecided when the polls are taken this could happen again in the u s it may be the case that the big advance that obama has at this point may completely shift in the election
6861969 the medicare drug benefit has produced tangible relief for millions of people despite the unusual coverage gap that was created to make the benefit fit within budget constraints
6861970 but if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6861971 the day after is more relaxed for those who wear condoms
6861972 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6861973 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6861974 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of war
6861975 i strongly advise the public especially those at risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6861976 one of the most common behavioral changes cancer survivors make sometimes without a doctors advice often on their own is using dietary supplements in hopes of bolstering their health
6861977 still its unclear whether supplements really help keep cancer survivors healthier or put them at further risk they like many other people today use the internet and you can find a lot of false hope out there with supplements targeted at cancer survivors
6861978 in our study we see people taking supplements who have good diets and who are relatively healthy while they may need a particular vitamin because they dont get enough of it they may not need a multivitamin or supplement because of the increased risk of cancer recurrence or secondary cancer
6861979 early life environments can affect if you are a snorer or not later in life
6861980 perhaps these things like dogs infection might increase the size of the tonsils
6861981 its not clear how the dog and the large family is associated with snoring
6861982 certainly individuals who are exposed to severe airway episodes have recurrent ear infections live in large families where infection is common and have a dog may be more likely to develop an immunologic response in the airways leading to tonsillar and or adenoid enlargement and narrowing of the airway leading to snoring
6861983 i think we should do more studies before we take the dogs away
6861984 the greatest benefits and least risk from hrt are seen in the 99 percent of women who commence hrt for symptom relief near menopause this trial studied much older women who started hrt on average 13 to 14 years after menopause when they had fewer symptoms even in this group improved quality of life was seen in many taking hrt
6861985 i think this is an important study because since whi many have lost sight of the significant benefits of hormone therapy
6861986 this study reinforces the notion that for women with these symptoms hrt can improve your quality of life and the worse your symptoms the more theyll improve
6861987 for relief of symptoms its ok to go on hrt as long as you have none of the absolute contraindications like a history of

6862028 i know my brother would never do anything like that
6862029 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6862030 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6862031 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6862032 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6862033 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6862034 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6862035 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6862036 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6862037 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly
6862038 in the end a regular commerce site came in and found a way to steal ebays thunder
6862039 ebay is bleeding and its going to have to step up and stem the bleeding

6862042 el contratista entiende y reconoce que el lugar de prestaci n de servicios es de alto riesgo vol til hostil y un ambiente extremadamente peligroso y que las autoridades militares est n continuamente llevando a cabo operaciones militares en la regi n
6862043 no puedo decir que fui a vacacionar a irak a cada paso que das est s arriesgado a que te caiga un mortero qu me qued de mi experiencia solo el terror
6862044 firman un contrato inexistente que viola el c digo de trabajo salvadore o y todas las normas de la organizaci n internacional del trabajo
6862045 al final es la necesidad de la gente la que la lleva a firmar contratos mercenarios
6862046 de esas personas no es responsable el gobierno de el salvador porque viajan por su cuenta y riesgo
6862047 es obligaci n del estado que estas compa as no se aprovechen de la necesidad de los salvadore os

6862049 you couldnt see the knife it just looked like he punched him
6862050 our rationale is that to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the ways we staff and prioritize work
6862051 this action allows us to rationalize the size of our work force relative to the size of our customer base
6862052 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6862053 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6862054 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6862055 whatever your opinion its important to make sure your voice is heard
6862056 because they cant see or hear what we really want
6862057 financial stability is critical for this company and unfortunately a reduction in work force was necessary to achieve it
6862058 i am confident this action will set the company on the path to profitability so that we can continue to lead the very light jet category
6862059 you know the pain is there yet cant rouse yourself to care
6862060 well we are speaking of cosmic time and it is always noon somewhere
6862061 just return it and we are happy to give you a full refund
6862062 it doesnt mean that conservatives have abandoned the idea that religion should be involved in politics it seems to be a frustration were picking up
6862063 this question is closely linked with overall views of the party
6862064 people who view either party as unfriendly toward religion view them unfavorably
6862065 while its clear that evangelicals are not as anywhere enthusiastic about john mccain as about george w bush it doesnt mean that theyre going any other way
6862066 the question is whether evangelicals will turn out in the same kinds of numbers
6862067 i was pleased at first to hear that the producers were trying to make christianity accessible to people who might not usually watch religious programming
6862068 im starting to think i would prefer spending my sunday nights being bashed repeatedly in the face with a large leather bound king james version
6862069 the program says little about relationship and a great deal about regulation
6862070 while there is a slim chance it may promote conversation by and large my view is that it is damaging to the gospel
6862071 we were encouraged to take part on the understanding that we were dealing with a group of people who genuinely wanted to embrace christianity
6862072 in doing this they have edited a warped view of evangelical christianity
6862073 there seems to be very little mention of jesus and little mention of love
6862074 that is a really old style maybe your friend switched the tags and put it on this necklace
6862075 we have not received any quality issues regarding this item
6862076 right after world war ii the navy did a lot for the people of
6862077 i recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country
6862078 it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered
6862079 i have had no choice but to decrease the total budget
6862080 its extremely difficult because failure breeds failure and contributors are less likely to spend money on a losing cause
6862081 republicans just need to adapt to the conditions in each individual state because if this election is a referendum on the state of the country then theyre going to do very badly
6862082 i dont want to say anything wrong about my brother but i just dont see it the way he does
6862083 franklin called me and said he thought the movie was dorky but i think its good and positive and i think it honors the lord and my mother and daddy
6862084 i dont know why franklin felt like he had to make a public statement i wish hed just left it alone
6862085 has not collaborated with nor does it endorse the movie billy the early years
6862086 weve been hearing about a lot of confusion particularly at these early screenings about the bgeas affiliation with the film
6862087 some folks promoting the movie have said things that foster that impression and its a false impression the bgea didnt have anything to do with this film its an independent film
6862088 thats been his consistent concern that our film would mistakenly be associated with the bgea
6862089 we knew from the beginning that they had a policy about no endorsements and i respect that policy
6862090 lacks my fathers greatest passion to preach the gospel of the lord jesus christ to the world
6862091 franklin says it doesnt portray daddys passion for preaching but i think it does
6862092 besides im not sure daddy ever had a passion for preaching daddy had a calling and he accepted that calling and faithfully followed it
6862093 frappuccinos gone i still do drink coffee but just with equal she tells
6862094 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar
6862095 i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6862096 technology is likely to blur the lines between transit and driving and make both greener and more flexible
6862097 so what are you going to do starting at 11 p m with your friend who is living on campus this summer
6862098 just hang out we havent been able to do that for a while
6862099 you realize that its 11 oclock and that you work at 7 30 in the morning right
6862100 mom ive been getting myself up for the last 8 years i know what time it is but we havent been able to hang out much this summer and were both available right now i wont wake you up when i come home
6862101 the fight to get in the struggle to get out
6862102 it was coming in and it hit the pole and if it wasnt for the pole it would have probably came in left field and hit some of us
6862103 i didnt know what to do i was so scared
6862104 the left wing was kind of hanging and it was on top of them so we were trying to move the wing so they could crawl out
6862105 weve just been praying for the pilot and his passenger and hope theyre ok
6862106 dear santa please send me a blonde wimminz oh and a red ryder bb gun too
6862107 for us in the united states were pleased with the results of the discussion and i remain very optimistic that were going to continue to make progress toward this important goal
6862108 we had expected them to have a new draft ready today but apparently there were so many amendments and problems that they didnt get it done in time
6862109 the independent witnesses we have do not support that something that was inappropriate was said
6862110 we have about 20 people that we interviewed we believe this is as far as were going to go with the case
6862111 that said its important to remember nobody has been found guilty of anything yet so we should let it take its course through the courts
6862112 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6862113 we will have to see what other issues were present
6862114 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the maneuver and have it reviewed
6862115 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6862116 what am i doing stuck here in this huge hotel when my children have been moved 30 kilometres away i want to be with them
6862117 they really want to go home so they can get on with their lives
6862118 that is the way they will best deal with this situation
6862119 he thought it was a movie and asked where his father was and when the movie would end
6862120 there are multiple factors that have produced our high hiv aids rate and it will take multiple factors to bring it down
6862121 if you want to reduce the spread of hiv you put more syringes out there
6862122 needle exchange is not a standalone intervention its bundled with a lot of wraparound services
6862123 oh you look so much like your mom but not are you sad youre not as pretty as she was
6862124 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6862125 he said he was unable to gain altitude and was going down
6862126 canadas conservative government has made protecting the arctic a real priority were not just talking about it were taking real and specific action
6862127 protecting the bowhead whales of niginganiq has been a 26 year marathon effort
6862128 so youre still in the oh hes so cute phase
6862129 when i was drafted i was excited now being signed its even more exciting i am looking forward to taking the next step and playing pro
6862130 the biggest key in my development was defining my role i know what type of player they expect me to be
6862131 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6862132 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6862133 facts that have come out so far are the 200 contribution by ayers to the obama re election fund
6862134 to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6862135 theres no political involvement at all with regard to how canada will be presented to the world other than our desire to see vanoc the vancouver olympic organizing committee succeed in presenting the 2010 games and canada to the world
6862136 a great ceremonies that will take canada out to the world is going to be the result of collaboration and co operation and input from many many different places
6862137 on behalf of canadian taxpayers we want to make sure that federal dollars are spent in a way thatll promote the 2010 games and promote successful opening ceremonies
6862138 also were hopeful that the 2010 olympic committee will present a fantastic show to canadians and the world and opening ceremonies that will reflect canadas multicultural reality our bicultural history and our official language communities across the country and thats what were hopeful for in terms of getting a return for our investment
6862139 keep in mind this is a memo from one bureaucrat to another
6862140 it had nothing to do with myself or other ministers or the government this is a conversation between two bureaucrats and thats fine
6862141 but our goals internationally and domestically again are to present fantastic opening ceremonies that reflect canadas cultural past our cultural present and promotes canada as the greatest place in the world to live
6862142 we dont see that memo as being political it speaks to the domestic and international priorities of the government
6862143 we have spent a tremendous amount of time with the government of canada understanding brand canada and what they are taking canada out to the world and to canadians as and were aligned with that
6862144 i think the word appropriate is key to what is meant there
6862145 theyre putting in half they would have a lot to say about what goes in
6862146 you bring all of the opinions together you accept some you reject some you modify others you come up with a program for everything
6862147 in a clandestine phone call placed last week brad pitt counseled ex wife jennifer aniston through her recent split with rocker john mayer unbeknowest to partner angelina jolie the exes reconnected during a tender heart to heart that occured when jen called her former mother in law jane pitt at ch teau miraval where shes staying with brad tried venting to jane about her painful split with mayer but the elder mrs pitt thought the former friends star would gain more solace from speaking with brad
6862148 i am originally from coquitlam which is a suburb of vancouver i went to school for broadcasting at the british columbia institute of technology and i have my degree in broadcast communications
6862149 while i was working towards my diploma i worked for the western lacrosse association doing the play by play for the game of the week i also worked for the coquitlam adanacs and the victoria shamrocks doing certain games that were broadcast on the internet
6862150 as soon as i graduated school i got a position in merritt with the centennials in the british columbia hockey league i spent fours years as the play by play voice over the years i kind of added to my job title where i started as the marketing manager and ended up as the director of player personnel in a smaller market even in the bchl you kind of have got to wear a lot of hats i got the opportunity to do a lot of things including the media public relations and sales marketing and even a lot of the operation side of things being directly involved with everything underneath the general manager
6862151 so far it has been an excellent experience everybody in and around the organization has been nothing but helpful and very accommodating anytime you are in a new situation it sometimes difficult to learn some of the ropes but not here the people have been absolutely fantastic to work with
6862152 yes absolutely at almost every single aspect and level at this point i havent seen the games or the players but from what i have been told and looking at some of the guys that have been around you can tell that they are just a different kind of athlete from the hockey side of things extremely committed you can tell they are fit and they have aspirations of playing pro in the bc hockey league you have top end guys that will carry over and could play in the western hockey league as we have seen in the past as an organization and as a league standpoint the professionalism that the league western hockey league demands of its teams and the teams want to portray whether being the number of office staff and how things are run things that you notice the most are all the small details and how you are handled and the respect that you are given to do your job and to do it well and the expectations to do things as professionally as possible it is just some of the small details that i have learned even though swift current is in a smaller market that some of the bchl teams that are in bigger centres with more media but it is still much different from how they are run and what the expectations are at this level of hockey
6862153 absolutely i have followed the leadership of people around me and sort of a timeline when you go through things for the first time there is a stage where you have to get your feet wet everything that comes away from the office or the rink is a lot of a distraction too you are moving you are buying a house in and out of boxes and those things you go through are almost more stressful than the fact you are coming to work you have a passion of what you do and that is the easy part of the adjustment
6862154 still even in that de prioritized state its going to be faster than a typical dsl connection
6862155 certain elements of the raw data are out there now
6862156 like any system you have to look and see what the results were and how it operated and analyze those outcomes
6862157 weve given each organization some guidance along the way on what they ought to be focused on including looking at the rating results across different demographic categories
6862158 they will make adjustments address any issues and put more focus on training their managers they also will look at how their pay pools are constructed and how they diversify the pay pool panel
6862159 wait and see if the system is unfair to different people
6862160 the agency is going to try to make light of these figures saying one year of data does not indicate a trend
6862161 we should not let them off the hook that easily this is a big problem and the agency should recognize that
6862162 all you have to do is look at a couple of these pages and if youre white and male youre doing well
6862163 its not surprising weve seen these pay for performance systems in the federal government and they are discriminatory against people of color and women
6862164 this should say to employees that the process is effective
6862165 if there are changes to ratings in the reconsideration process organizations will pay out the higher amount regardless of the fact that the pay pool money has been spent
6862166 what weve attempted to do with nsps is essentially make the proportion of objectivity greater than the subjectivity by emphasizing good solid job objectives that are measurable and observable so employees can decide what it takes to get a 3 4 or 5 rating

6862168 the company released four same sex couple cards thursday morning the cards are tasteful and the wording is appropriate for same sex weddings civil unions or commitments sarah kolell spokeswoman for hallmark said the company wanted to be relevant to a market it was not addressing
6862169 weve all given or received hallmark cards remember their slogan when you care enough to send the very best but promoting same sex marriage for profit is not the very best for families or our nation hallmark is a private company obviously driven by greed

6862171 afa has a long history of silly offensive boycotts against among others wal mart for selling
6862172 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming
6862173 to have great britain come second and seventh is just amazing
6862174 it was great fun ive had a brilliant time all day and to come second makes it even better its been amazing to compete in front of so many people
6862175 i gave it my heart and everything but today it wasnt good enough
6862176 the conversations that were having with the iraqis now are based on the improvement in security and our mutual desire to bring more american troops home
6862177 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq

6862181 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here
6862182 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong
6862183 this buffer zone actually refers to agreements from 1999 and 1994 and my view is that it is against the spirit of the so called ceasefire agreement
6862184 my interpretation is that buffer zones should not be built but we will discuss all this during the next few days
6862185 we should not at this stage look only at monetary policy but keep the regulatory side firmly in focus
6862186 our concept of monetary policy is based on two pillars and there is a very very deep analysis of the monetary situation

6862197 the producers for living lohan have been talking to michael about being on the show
6862198 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
6862199 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6862200 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6862201 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6862202 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6862203 hey we should make our next superman movie dark too lets just completely ignore that the darkness of character plot and literal appearance exhibited in the dark knight is completely intrinsic to the batman mythos and inappropriately shoehorn that sensibility to a vast well established fictional universe
6862204 people like hawaii people like saved by the bell saved by the bell in hawaii cant miss so what if the very title of the show refers to school we dont need the school

6862227 king randolph rustin and the march they helped organize were all part of an extant insurgent political movement
6862228 the 1963 march on washington was neither spontaneous nor was it a novel concept
6862229 social movements require the dedication of hundreds or even thousands of men and women working towards reasonably well defined tangible goals
6862230 the messianic model of progressive politics that has come to dominate popular discourse about social movements is especially problematic
6862231 king randolph and rustin did not pander to opponents to their right
6862232 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6862233 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6862234 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6862235 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat

6862300 its my understanding that they the russians have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6862301 the russians have finally begun to move their forces out of georgia but they have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
6862302 we hope our presence demonstrates american solidarity and lifts the morale of the georgian people

6862306 i was thinking about us at training camp the whole preparation process i think the chinese pingpong team has really accomplished something
6862307 the chinese team isnt lacking talented pingpong athletes ive had a pingpong career of more than 20 years so i hope to have a new kind of lifestyle
6862308 i thought it was a really hard match the competition within our team is very fierce and the strategy is changing with every shot and im wondering whether she will be able to figure out what im thinking its really complicated

6862320 ten years ago the merger between westpac and st george was unthinkable the recent tightening in financial markets has strengthened the relative position of the banks vis a vis non bank competitors and means that any increase in banking concentration needs close scrutiny
6862321 of all the mergers approved in my time the bank of melbourne was the most unpopular with consumers people would stop me at parties and complain about it
6862322 the treasurer is responsible for maintaining meaningful competition in the banking sector and there is no point in bank customers being able to switch banks if there are fewer banks to switch to
6862323 its about time someone factored employment and the community into the national interest test

6862399 the four directions east south west and north represent the four seasons spring summer autumn and winter together with the center which in chinese is synonymous with china itself they form the five cardinal points the four directions have been represented at least since the second century bc by four celestial animals the dragon for the east the bird for the south the tiger for the west and the tortoise for the north each animal has its own colour the dragon is the green of spring the bird the red of fire the tiger of autumn the glittering white of metal of ploughshares or swords and the tortoise black for night or water the four celestial animals which have no connection with the are also the names of the four divisions of the sky the dragons heart the pleiades and the bird star are the names of three of the lunar mansions which marked the central position of the dragon tiger and bird as there was no identifying star at the centre of the black tortoise the appropriate place the eleventh mansion was called void
6862400 however it seems that before the adoption of the four celestial emblems there were only three the feng bird or phoenix the dragon and the or unicorn bronze mirrors usually portray cosmological patterns and symbolism on the back those of the tang period 618 906 ad show all twelve or sometimes the 28 or even 36 animals of the and those of an earlier period depict the four celestial emblems referred to above but the very earliest mirrors show only the three the the feng huang and the dragon because of the astronomical significance the white tiger replaced the and the phoenix gave way to the red bird which is of uncertain identity thus the tortoise was a later but not the last addition for many mystical texts refer to the northern constellation not as the tortoise but as the black warrior
6862401 one of the celestial emblems the symbol of longevity and wisdom it is said that its shell represents the vault of the universe a common symbol for longevity is the tortoise and snake whose union was thought to have engendered the universe the reason why tortoise symbolism has been superseded by the black warrior as the emblem of the north is probably due to the fact that tortoise is a term of abuse in china
6862402 in china the tortoise had divine attributes tortoise shell is a symbol of unchangeability and a symbol or rank when used for court girdles the tortoise was also used for purposes of divination a gigantic mythical tortoise is supposed in the far east to live in the depths of the ocean it has one eye situated in the middle of its body once every three thousand years it rises to the surface and turns over on its back so that it may see the sun

6862413 we found that eventually they senesced and were cleared from the liver to protect it from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury
6862414 cell cycle arrest in the cells that generate the fibrosis places a kind of brake on the process limiting how far it can go
6862415 we hypothesize that hscs when they senesce secret less fibrogenic protein and also stimulate a process that tends to degrade proteins that are still present in a lesion
6862416 senescence is a kind of homeostatic mechanism that enables the tissue to return to its pre damaged state

6862424 the results of this study suggest that a fully integrated medicare benefit structured around low cost pharmacotherapy in conjunction with available free quitline services would substantially reduce the prevalence of smoking and smoking related illness among elderly beneficiaries motivated to quit at a relatively modest cost
6862425 a person smoking twenty or more cigarettes per day and who quit at age 65 could expect to increase their life expectancy by two to three years in addition to any improvements in quality of life

6862445 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations

6862456 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6862457 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers

6862500 t9s objective is to make it easier to type text messages it allows words to be entered by a single keypress for each letter as opposed to the multi tap approach used in the older generation of mobile phones in which several letters are associated with each key and selecting one letter often requires multiple keypresses it combines the groups of letters on each phone key with a fast access dictionary of words it looks up in the dictionary all words corresponding to the sequence of keypresses and orders them by frequency of use

6862521 people like hawaii people like saved by the bell saved by the bell in hawaii cant miss so what if the very title of the show refers to school we dont need the school
6862522 its tough but complaining is not going to help a lot of times just coming up here to wrigley field guys forget about that they just love being out here
6862523 we are hopeful that he will be able to contribute to the nationals major league team in september
6862524 its meant to ask the question if you were to see the country in the eyes of ninoy what is it that you will see and what can you do to help the country
6862525 by proclaiming i am ninoy they remind themselves that the way out of this malaise is in their hands all it would take is to be true to what they believe in and to surface the hero inside each of them
6862526 you have to look at it from the point of view of the whole campaign the t shirt is just one part of the engagement by buying the shirt theyre already giving to charity and doing something to help the country they can watch documentaries on the web site and see which charity is benefiting from the sales and maybe even get involved
6862527 any advertising or any successful brand campaign has a message and all the different media support it we are very careful to put the substance behind this campaign we want to make sure that the lessons ninoy left behind are never lost
6862528 hybrid models that shift from gasoline fuel to electric power at the touch of a button
6862529 we should remember the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain is a minority versus majority issue and if it would always be the tyranny of the majority that would be imposed the aspirations of the minority would never be realized
6862530 i think weve matured in the past five to ten years maybe in another five to ten years we can hope to achieve things that are currently available in singapore or thailand where the awareness is much higher
6862531 when you lead an institution thats been around for 200 years you develop specific ideas about the sustainability of your communitys culture and roots
6862532 i think the board was looking for someone with a background as a corporate lawyer and roots in harlem has a 50 year plan and theyre no joke theyre a force to be reckoned with
6862533 it would be great if our community had say a seven year plan the market forces are moving so quickly now theyre calling everything south of 125th street soha for south harlem im like what soha is that what we want for ourselves to be like soho its not appropriate or fair its not going to be healthy if we end up with a lot of rich people public housing and nothing in between
6862534 but even the women partners were against pants i believe i was just the second black woman to work there as a lawyer in the history of the firm i had grown up in the nonprofit world but my mother told me i should take a job in the for profit realm because there were things i could learn there that i could bring to my community
6862535 i became very interested in economic justice issues particularly community development as an extension of civil rights and access to equity in communities of color
6862536 investors had typically looked at harlem and our community like it has no value like it was just bankrupt
6862537 we saw good things here and wanted to knit our neighborhoods back together the way they were before crack and aids destroyed them
6862538 it is ludicrous for anyone to accuse us of building market rate housing or pushing through projects that the community does not want
6862539 weve never done any project that the local community board did not approve all our housing is 100 percent affordable there are just different degrees of affordable to build 100 percent low income housing you need a ton of subsidies try going to the city and state for that level of funding and believe me theyll look at you like youre crazy

6862562 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days
6862563 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6862564 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation
6862565 likewise there has been nothing more on xabi alonso at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player
6862566 the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him
6862567 we have had an approach from stoke about sami but we want to keep him
6862568 when we talked about a new contract in the summer it was clear that sami wanted to stay at the club
6862569 the groups work is often called technocratic and their designs are described as avant garde with a rhetorical character

6862616 i am honored to be named the next artistic director of and to continue the high artistic tradition the rep has established under the leadership of timothy near
6862617 my work has always been to find the plays stories and voices that have a powerful and lasting impact on an audience and to use these plays as a way to begin a real engagement between community and artists around the important questions and ideas of our times im very excited to begin planning my first season for silicon valley and ill be spending as much time as i can at the rep this fall to get the feel for my new home

6862621 a whole new scene no longer just a coda or epilogue set years after the ending of the original play
6862622 the 60s and early 70s were arguably the richest era for pop music in the whole to even broadway which as we know was enjoying sort of its last gasp at the top of the hit parade with everything from carole king interestingly enough those last three just had a best selling book published about their music and the complicated relationship between them called one thing thats different about the musical is that it goes beyond the timeframe of the original play and adds a new scene set 15 years later that takes us to about 1990 by which time pop music obviously had a whole different kind of sound so we have some fun with that for one song
6862623 but hopefully the whole thing is filtered through a theatrical sensibility and my own style and sounds cohesive as a score i love jacks original play and these three characters and ive been having the time of life musicalizing all of it with him

6862657 that the script was written for faris who shares exec producer credits with the pics scribes is evident shelley is a guileless tomato with a heart of gold and faris dances delicately between her pure sweetness and hilarious ineptitude never making the character an object of ridicule but never pretending shes a genius either the easy comparison is to marilyn monroe faris a bombshell effects the same soft voice and endearing cluelessness but shelley has a lot more angles than most of monroes characters and the place faris has carved out for herself is inseparable from her own particular talents and personality

6862664 the republicans dont expect us to vote for them because they turned their backs on us before i was even born
6862665 the democrats claim us as their base they expect us to vote for them but we want to make it clear that they cant take our votes for granted if obama is not going to end the war hes no better than the other candidates
6862666 i think its no secret that the obama campaign has been incredibly exciting and we all want to be down
6862667 i think theres an overarching sense of hopefulness and a chance to reclaim the county from what weve seen during the last eight years
6862668 i think its really important that tent state is youth led and at our shows were getting a sense of who this next generation is 16 to 17 year old kids whose first real memory of any foreign policy event is september 11 then the war in iraq for five years and katrina
6862669 there are people who are rejecting whats happening while theyre hopeful about what can happen and were trying to support that
6862670 mimic the experiences we force on people in iraq palestine and on the u s mexico border
6862671 our actions are aimed at the delegates and reminding them of the power they hold in crafting the platform and pushing the candidate
6862672 this is their worst nightmare because they didnt want us near the convention center but we found a legal way to do it and it brought them more embarrassment
6862673 the best case scenario is acknowledgement from obama that the longer we stay in iraq the worse the resistance and anti american sentiment will be but we also want a revitalized youth movement because the biggest failure of the anti war movement has been re creating 40 year old tactics once the youth take charge which is happening here and in st paul i think well be more effective in bringing a swift end to this war

6862749 having grown up in el paso i heard these mexican songs all the time but honestly didnt like the overly sappy lyrics musically i found them to be full of passion and complex harmonies it made for a perfect opportunity to play all of the parts violin trumpet and vocal melody on the classical guitar

6862751 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something when there have been quotes in the papers saying its impossible to tie or break his record it just shows you anythings possible

6862762 i never thought he would be putting me through some of the stuff im going through now
6862763 i cant even get in contact with him for things for my baby its just hard
6862764 he has all kinds of cars bentleys mercedes benz ranger rovers two range rovers
6862765 and some people will pay because they dont want their picture on that poster
6862766 when these noncustodial parents dont support their children taxpayers get the bill for their financial and medical support

6862774 was go tell him last year that we were taking him out of the rotation
6862775 i had a feeling about him in spring training he was just throwing the ball great and was really really consistent
6862776 his sense of how to pitch is unbelievable and with his experience he knows how to get hitters out
6862777 he obviously doesnt have the power fastball like he used to anymore but hes still the same guy hes been for the last three years
6862778 he makes a living away he doesnt like pitching in and he makes you get yourself out
6862779 i know he has pitched against us at least twice maybe three times every time its been a little different
6862780 im not there every day to know why but i would have to say hes probably executed his pitches the way he wants to
6862781 i wasnt worried about how many games i was going to win
6862782 its still august so hopefully i can get a few more here before the seasons over
6862783 ive just been pleased ive been able to go out there every time its my turn and pitch well
6862784 it depends on what his motivation is is it something we want for him more than he wants for himself
6862785 i think he could get it if he decided to and i think the excitement of this year maybe will motivate him to do that i know it would mean a lot to him but hes also understanding of how much this game takes you away from your family
6862786 i was hoping id be important to the club this year i was hoping id have a role like ive had in the past
6862787 coming off of last year and the way things were setting up in spring training youre not sure how it will be and now here it is me and andy the two old guys that have been going out there
6862788 hopefully we can keep doing it were just trying to hold it together and win some ball games and give us a chance to sneak back into this thing
6862789 the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6862790 the greens are a little bit softer they got a little firm and crusty on us yesterday afternoon a little more difficult to putt on
6862791 it seems like theres such a long gap to his next race
6862792 hes got a void to fill and hes earned it
6862793 the united states maintained about 130 military advisers in georgia along with civilian advisers contractors involved in all aspects of the georgian government and people doing business in georgia it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier u s technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions the russians clearly knew the georgians were ready to move how could the united states not be aware of the russians indeed given the posture of russian troops how could intelligence analysts have missed the possibility that the russians had laid a trap hoping for a georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack

6862797 steven has had two injuries he was 10 15 days without training and then it happened again
6862798 clearly in a couple of weeks he will be back to his best he has needed time to get fit after his injuries and it has been important to protect him
6862799 steven has great game intelligence and he can play anywhere gerrard played with intelligence and england drew that is all i would want to say about it
6862800 we know what is the best position for gerrard but he is capable of playing in other positions
6862801 we know where he can play really well and we know where he likes to play we will concentrate on using him to his strengths
6862802 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6862803 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6862804 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days
6862805 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6862806 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation

6862835 who do you think you are to challenge the government
6862836 it was clear that the operation was well planned because it took only few minutes and the people who carried out the raid knew very well what to do without mistakes

6862905 dr andrews is internationally recognized and respected for his skills as an orthopaedic surgeon as well as his scientific and clinical research contributions in knee shoulder and elbow injury prevention and treatment
6862906 his insight into the research development and implementation of the little league pitch count rule and counsel on other topics relevant to the direction of the little league program provide another strong voice to the discussion as the little league program looks to the future
6862907 dr andrews has vigorously supported little leagues position in the areas of sports safety and injury prevention and was a prominent figure in pioneering the little league pitch count
6862908 on several occasions dr andrews has graciously agreed to provide his insights and expertise in support of the little league program as we strive to better understand the dynamics of the pitch count as well as the devastating ramifications of over use injuries
6862909 beyond his expert medical opinions dr andrews also was an accomplished collegiate athlete and can relate to the situations and circumstances that drive athletes to excel
6862910 to the point his experience with todays athletes will be a valuable resource as the little league international board of directors continues to navigate the program in a productive and positive direction

6862914 i think you work for the senegalese or maybe burkina faso
6862915 at this moment two army officers from niger are here to look over documents about their border with burkina faso there is gold on that border you know
6862916 mali fought two border wars with burkina faso you know
6862917 oui la non la a droite a gauche there near the those bushes
6862918 an official burkinabe team was here a few weeks ago
6862919 both governments are sending people to the archives all over west africa to find anything they can to prove their case about where the border is or where they think it should be
6862920 last year we caught a frenchman trying to take documents concerning our border with senegal he was a history professor working for senegal
6862921 but some colonial officer in senegal altered it for his pleasure he redrew the border to take land on the east side of the river the mali side into senegal for his own personal hunting ground he took his mistresses there to show them how to shoot and who knows what else this is the way they treated their colonies a change here a change there like dough
6862922 the hunter the frenchman who wanted the hunting ground along the river
6862923 maybe that professor is a cousin of the french officer and wanted to preserve the family hunting rights
6862924 um so is there some document the french officer signed did the governor general issue a decree to change the border
6862925 there is nothing thats the issue we cant prove or disprove why the border is the way it is except that its been this way since the time of the french all so this frenchmen could shoot birds and rabbits and have a private place of leisure for his family
6862926 of course i have but do you think they would let us see anything of importance
6862927 so my friend you are allowed only paper and pencil at the reading tables and if you figure out how they drew our borders please let us all know

6862982 before the fine was introduced the teachers and parents had a social contract with social norms about being late thus if parents were late as they occasionally were they felt guilty about it and their guilt compelled them to be more prompt in picking up their kids in the future but once the fine was imposed the day care center had inadvertently replaced the social norms with market norms now that the parents were paying for their tardiness they interpreted the situation in terms of market norms since they were being fined they could decide for themselves whether to be late or not and they frequently chose to be late
6862983 in the second lebanon war we had much greater means and capabilities which we avoided using since during that war we fought against a terror organization and not a country

6863024 david brooks is too honest to deny that john mccains campaign has devolved into little more than a series of daily attacks on barack obama
6863025 its a shame for and on the american public if the only way john mccain has a chance to win this election is by bad mouthing barack obama and by not calling for an immediate end to the swift boating others in his party are attempting rather than putting forth his own agenda

6863041 essentially theyd like that area to join city of kelowna and they want the city to do a study of the tax impact the city had previously reviewed such a submission and decided they didnt want to do a study at that point the city learned the province wont provide funding for a study so theyd be on their own
6863042 are you in favour of the city doing a study on the chance of joining kelowna

6863046 some of the very large boats are so bad if you are sitting on your balcony or patio and they go by on the other side of the lake youll have to stop your conversation because you cant hear its that loud
6863047 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6863048 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6863049 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly
6863050 we also have to realize that these things have been sitting in the water for the past 50 years so its not like were introducing them to a foreign body
6863051 the prime concern would appear to be a little bit of turbidity as they land on the bottom of the lake i suspect that we do far more damage to okanagan lake with our milfoil program than will be done by these pontoons

6863075 though we travel the world over to find the beautiful we must carry it with us or we find it not
6863076 we certainly are seeing more interest in full size suvs and trucks over the last several weeks
6863077 remember we are in our eighth week of declining fuel prices in the u s
6863078 in may we were selling one truck for every one car we sold at our dealers and we had never been one to one it was always three trucks to two cars
6863079 however in june when ford came out with employee pricing things changed my theory is when something is cheap enough people buy it we began to see the trend for sales go back more toward trucks
6863080 july was really something we had our best truck month in the pittsburgh region since august 2007 that really blew our minds so the incentives combined with the reduction in gas prices greatly increased our truck sales
6863081 last month when you saw gas prices going down a little we noticed that the price and value reductions for big cars and trucks slowed down also the increases in the residual value of small cars leveled off too they are still increasing but at a reduced rate
6863082 our experience has been that american consumers adapt pretty rapidly to fuel price spikes and higher fuel prices i think people were initially shocked and there were some people who reacted in knee jerk fashion and said hey i gotta get out of my suv or hey i dont want to spend 100 for a tank of gas now people are starting to have a more rational take on all of this
6863083 residual values a new vehicles projected value after 36 months for trucks and full sized suvs declined at about twice the rate at which they normally declined over the last few months that was very steep
6863084 now things are starting to level out again some suvs like chevy tahoe ford expedition and toyota land cruiser had dropped by as much as 25 or 30 percent over a six month period of time those residual values have now stabilized
6863085 in die tijd blonken de verschillende groepen uit in gepolitiseerd en ge deologiseerd denken al in de jaren tachtig toen ook duyvendak actief was werd dat allemaal veel pragmatischer en professioneler
6863086 er zijn nog een paar marxistisch getinte groepjes actief verder gaat het toch om losse personen uit de kraakbeweging die actief zijn in antiglobalistische groepen

6863088 de aandacht gaat uit naar partijen en organisaties maar ook naar flu de netwerken van linkse en rechts extremisten die zich zowel in de politieke arena als op straat manifesteren

6863090 jullie hebben in het verleden te veel onzin over ons geschreven het enige wat jullie doen is siebelt onderzoeksjournalist en criticaster van het linkse actiewezen peter siebelt red napraten daar heb ik helemaal niets mee en ja zo denkt iedereen erover hier binnen vrankrijk
6863091 ik vind het jammer dat vrankrijk als symbool van het actiewezen wordt gezien het is immers geen beweging maar gewoon een mooi pand een fijne plek om te wonen
6863092 ik heb eigenlijk geen tijd ben ook niet zo betrokken bij het actiewezen

6863111 the roots of freedom are deep within the intimate personhood of god all true freedom is in a real sense religious freedom it is that which replicates the divine in all of us that makes us 17
6863112 if we all in some serious way replicate god religious liberty is a moral and social inevitability
6863113 the practical effect of the stress upon soul competency as the cardinal doctrine of baptists was to make everyones hat their own church
6863114 aint nobody but jesus goin to tell me what to believe
6863115 the competence of the individual before god does not demand and in fact precludes lone ranger religion no matter what critics left and right may say autonomous individualism does not mean that everyones church is ones own hat the longing for community and social christianity presupposes voluntarism without individual autonomy there can be no authentic community
6863116 no where have i seen a baptist church that measures up to the vision of community held up by wallis nor have i known a baptist church that wouldnt be a bit frightened by his idealism nor one that couldnt use a good dose of it

6863140 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6863141 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6863142 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6863143 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6863150 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6863151 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat

6863169 claims by the business council of australia that fixing climate change would be devastating for australias economy simply do not add up
6863170 the value of one day of trading on the australian share market is more in dollar terms than would be traded in an entire year in an established carbon trading market compared to daily trades on the share market carbon trading will be small change on rough numbers the value of carbon trading will be much less than 20 million per day
6863171 the truth is the total value of carbon traded annually will be in financial markets terms very small indeed as emissions reduce the number is more likely to fall unless we are ineffectual in rolling out energy efficiency across the nation and fail to commit to quickly build renewable energy generation
6863172 and in addition to emissions trading investment to reach a 20 renewable energy target by 2020 will require funds in the range of 25 to 35 billion over the next decade at an average of 3 billion a year over 12 years thats not a big number either and will be an investment that will make a world of difference
6863173 this is not to belittle the importance of the task of addressing climate change and designing the best possible emissions trading scheme to assist in the task of reducing greenhouse gas emissions without compromising our industries it will be challenging but not compromising does not mean not inconveniencing we actually have to do as much as we can
6863174 a combination of a trading system paired with direct incentives for industry to reduce emissions through both energy efficiency and procurement of lower emissions energy will actually diversify the economy and create a more robust environment for business energy efficiency is a critical component as it will reduce inflationary pressures that would otherwise occur through spiraling fossil fuel prices
6863175 and the investments we are talking about wont be losses investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy will deliver projects returning real profits in real operations with real jobs that deliver real emissions free energy and help build a more efficient more sustainable economy
6863176 we must fundamentally change the way we think about energy and how we do business the numbers from the economic naysayers who are still planning an economy based on paradigms and activities of the last century that simply do not add up nor do they provide the solutions needed for this century
6863177 the inconvenient truth is it is economic reform is achievable while we do not pretend it will be easy or the same as it has always been reform will not break the economy a well designed emissions trading scheme with scientifically based targets and strong support for our energy based industries to reposition their energy sources will create new opportunities in a more sustainable business environment

6863201 will give mayors needed flexibility in choosing the person that will run the department of buildings while also ensuring that an individual with the technical expertise of a licensed architect or engineer is in the departments highest leadership levels
6863202 but they are making a big mistake with this decision
6863203 its very important that the commissioner is a professional architect or engineer
6863204 this is really a public safety issue at the scene of a disaster the mayor turns to the commissioner for advice whoever is in that position should not have to be calling a deputy
6863205 abides by california state law for chiefs of building departments
6863206 there are certain criteria nonlicensed candidates have to meet but if you are a licensed architect or engineer you do not need further education to meet the states requirements
6863207 we must be absolutely sure that all who make decisions that affect public safety be licensed professionals approval of plans and issues of variances to the building laws cannot be left to administrators without professional training and licensure

6863227 the bomb that healed rabbi jacob m rothschild civil rights and the temple bombing of 1958
6863228 the bombers had intended to intimidate jews who were seen as co conspirators along with blacks in the civil rights struggle but this act of terror had the opposite effect
6863229 when the temples spiritual leader rabbi rothschild returned to his office the following day he was greeted with mailbags filled with sympathetic messages from atlanta and from across the nation
6863230 this was an especially significant achievement considering that some of atlantas jews feared challenging atlantas rigid racial order
6863231 they themselves had often been victims of social discrimination and even virulent attacks such as the lynching of leo frank in 1915 they hoped that if they kept a low profile discrimination would pass and they would eventually be accepted
6863232 was a testimonial not only to me but to the greatness of the city of atlanta the south the nation and its ability to rise above the conflict of former gen erations

6863248 i really miss doing as many interviews as i used to

6863253 this will be an opportunity to do some of that

6863264 i think theres ample room for nuance to sweeten the bid given its an all stock offering and theyve got cash on the balance sheet
6863265 i dont think it is imperative but it is something that could be incremental to their business model long term
6863266 zis refusal to negotiate is perplexing and inappropriate given the compelling premium our proposal represents to zis market price and the liquidity opportunity it will create especially in light of the disappointing financial performance and cash outlook zi reported last week

6863285 john the baptist a godly man of their recent history reincarnated to deliver a message to the people from god
6863286 but what about you who do you say that i am
6863287 but what about you my followers my friends my co workers
6863288 if a man finds scattered money it belongs to the finder
6863289 he is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose
6863290 look even if the lord should open the floodgates of the heavens could this happen
6863291 i believe yes i believe yes i believe its well with me
6863292 when thus passest through the waters i will be with thee and throughout the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
6863293 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation
6863294 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation
6863295 theres gotta to be more to life than studying and working and partying theres gotta to be more to life than saving all your money so that you can die and leave it for someone else theres gotta to be more to life than watching righteous men get what the wicked deserve and watching wicked men getting what the righteous deserve
6863296 life is a bummer and i cant take it anymore
6863297 people write about the same things they talk about the same things they aggravate me with the same things life is just the same old same old life is loaded with meaningless repetition
6863298 and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs v 14 and they talked together of all these things which had happened v 15 and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them v 16 but their eyes were holden that they should not know him v 17 and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad v 18 and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days v 19 and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people
6863299 before i die i mean to make a pilgrimage to the holy land i will climb mount sinai and read the 10 commandments aloud at the top
6863300 for whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point he has become guilty of all
6863301 all have turned aside together they have become useless there is none who does good there is not even one
6863302 he jesus told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and viewed others with contempt
6863303 and there is no creature hidden from his sight but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him to whom we must give account
6863304 as a dog that returns to his vomit a fool that repeats his folly
6863305 for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and are overcome the last state has become worse for them than the first for it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them
6863306 and from then on no one dared ask him any more questions
6863307 the chief priests and the teachers of the law began looking for a way to kill him
6863308 while jesus was walking in the temple courts the chief priests the teachers of the law and the elders came to him by what authority are you doing these things and who gave you authority to do this
6863309 then they looked for a way to arrest him later they sent some of the pharisees and herodians to jesus to catch him in his words
6863310 then the sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him with a question
6863311 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
6863312 praise the lord sing to the lord a new song sing his praises in the assembly of the faithful
6863313 you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again it is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men
6863314 you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hidden
6863315 whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life
6863316 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples v
6863317 go right over to the priest and let him examine you dont talk to anyone along the way take along the offering required in the law of moses for those who have been healed of leprosy so everyone will have proof of your healing
6863318 sternly warned them not to tell anyone that he was the messiah
6863319 truly i tell you among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than john the baptist yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the days of john the baptist until the present time the kingdom of heaven has endured violent assault and violent men seize it by force as a precious prize a share in the heavenly kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal and intense exertion
6863320 you received the spirit of adoption by whom we cry out

6863325 its a life changing experience to go to a place that has absolutely nothing and see happy people here in america we have too much stuff and we strive to get more and more and we are still not happy
6863326 you go to a place where they have nothing but friends and family and there are happy because of love friendships and family

6863331 i know your works that you have a name that you are alive but you are dead 2 be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found your works perfect before god 3 remember therefore how you have received and heard hold fast and repent therefore if you will not watch i will come upon you as a thief and you will not know what hour i will come upon you 4 you have a few names even in sardis who have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy 5 he who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments and i will not blot out his name from the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels 6 he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches
6863332 7 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things says he who is holy he who is true
6863333 the dreams of pharaoh are one god has shown pharaoh what he is about to do

6863335 now it came to pass in the morning that his pharaoh spirit was troubles and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all its wise men and pharaoh told them his dreams but there was no one who could interpret them for pharaoh
6863336 you have heard that it was said do not commit adultery
6863337 it has been said anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce 32 but i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness causes her to become an adulteress and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery
6863338 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
6863339 the first shall be last and the last shall be first
6863340 when neither sun or stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging we finally gave up all hope of being saved
6863341 in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
6863342 in a attempt to escape from the ship the sailors left the lifeboat down into the sea pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow then paul said to the centurion and the sailors unless these men stay with the ship you cannot be saved so the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away
6863343 you have heard that it was said to the people long ago do not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment 22 but i tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother some manuscripts add without cause will be subject to judgment
6863344 god gave me 4 daughters now they have been taken from me some day i will understand why

6863351 receiving amp treasuring the word and as we see in todays text this is for a purpose
6863352 gods purposes come to pass when your heart and mine gets the real god cry and the real god prayer comes into our spirit and the real god yearning gets in to our nature something is going to happen then it becomes the supreme desire of your soul the paramount issue all the powers and energies of your spirit of your souls and of your body are reaching out and crying to god for the answer it is going to come it is going to come it is going to come
6863353 for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the jews will arise from another place but you and your fathers family will perish and who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this
6863354 so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water 23and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marah
6863355 and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging
6863356 every bitter water flowing in life dry up in the name of jesus

6863421 cruach ardain was stunning but as we were about to make our way back down stuart suggested we take a different route

6863446 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6863447 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6863448 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6863449 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6863450 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6863451 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6863479 russia has the capacity to create a remarkable amount of distress in the oil markets it can use oil exports and natural gas as a lever against europe and the world and its territorial threats to central asia and eastern europe are also cause for legitimate concern
6863480 have caused the west to re evaluate the global oil and energy equation
6863481 whereas before the prevailing view was incorporation of russia into the oil and energy markets and as a net plus for production and supplies long term the new view is guarded
6863482 not only are supplies from russia now viewed as liabilities but the west now has to ask what other oil rich areas might russia might try to threaten and what about its natural gas relationship with germany
6863483 not as a way to expand western influence in ukraine and poland and the former central asian soviet republics but to prevent ukraine poland and europe from being at the mercy of russias whims
6863484 this isnt a new cold war but the new paradigm is one where new energy agreements are not likely to be signed with russia and it must also be checked if it threatens any western energy source

6863489 this is the sort of thing that is going to just further undermine our confidence among voters in the voting technology thats being used very widely right now
6863490 theres already been widespread criticism of the touchscreen technology and the lack of paper trail which means you dont have a meaningful recount capability
6863491 i would expect that over the next couple years as we move toward 2010 and 12 well likely see more movement and maybe a further push from congress toward setting up some kind of uniform national system were probably the only major democracy in the world that has this kind of highly decentralized system now
6863492 it makes designing the ballot and coming up with an efficient method of recording and counting votes much more complicated

6863505 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6863506 the jaw is growing up until the age of 15 16 years old
6863507 and theres a period where the adult teeth are actually pushing behind the baby teeth
6863508 the children who have that cute look of a jack o lantern where they are losing teeth and their adult teeth havent come in yet they are missing their maxillary bicuspids the upper teeth in front of the molars
6863509 the bones have growing points that have growth plates and they mature at a steady rate
6863510 obviously when you go through puberty they go through acceleration so in the fingers and wrist they fuse at different times any bone that grows there are standards for how mature they should be
6863511 we had parked up in st ives to have a bit of a play on the beach and eat fish and chips and my wife purchased a three hour ticket
6863512 then we came back to the car and as we were walking up to it we noticed wed been clamped
6863513 the charge was 70 plus vat and if we refused to pay it was 150 on top to be towed away

6863530 when we compared the crank from the winning bike to the control crank we had a 2008 gsx r1000 crank it was obvious that there were significant differences in the manufacture of the two crankshafts
6863531 so we went back to ohio ama headquarters received two more crankshafts from suzuki that matched the control crank that we already had in the truck which had also gone back to ohio so at that point we had three stock gsx r1000 crankshafts that all matched and one gsx r1000 crankshaft out of the bike that won on sunday at virginia that did not match and at that point after everyone had a good look at them the determination was made that that crank was illegal
6863532 it refers to the penalty applying across an event so because this race was a double header we applied the rule as we believe the rule was written to be applied
6863533 its more about manufacturing issues and understand i have to be really careful about what i say because i dont want to say anything prejudicial to the appeals process
6863534 weve been told suzuki will appeal were waiting on the paperwork our hope is to resolve the issue at road atlanta because obviously the championship is involved and dragging these things on never makes them better
6863535 because of the appeal its very very hard to go into any specifics
6863536 so i guess the only thing that we can say is we havent done anything wrong
6863537 theyve been checked a number of times over the years
6863538 that part hasnt changed since 2005 or something its the same part number it hasnt changed

6863570 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6863594 i was shocked to see your letter in which you falsely state that time warner cable made a decision not to carry the network while we were actually hard at work trying to reach a deal before the buckeyes first game
6863595 time warner cable is committed to reaching a reasonable and fair deal
6863596 in addition in the interest of all our customers buckeye fans and others alike while we continue our negotiations we are willing to offer the ohio state football games carried on the big ten network to our customers on a per game basis at a retail price set by you with 100 percent of the revenue going to you to ensure that our customers can see these games for the lowest possible price we will not keep one penny of the revenue generated from the sale of these games

6863614 its a big deal if he misses a couple of games but hopefully its not as big a deal as people think
6863615 hopefully i can go out there and win some ball games and keep us on the right track so when he does come back were still at the same spot we would be if he would have played
6863616 thats what im trying to do right now im trying to get ready
6863617 hes taken full advantage of it hes shown a lot of great things out there a lot of maturity a lot of composure hes definitely learned a lot in this position being the no 1 guy
6863618 i know he manning s not going to play this weekend
6863619 i know im going to take a lot of snaps this weekend so thats pretty much what im concentrating on
6863620 after this week normally the last preseason game you dont get to play very much well take a look at it then when we start preparing for chicago and well see the closer we get how ready he is
6863621 all in all i think it has gone pretty well besides field goals instead of touchdowns
6863622 but you keep plugging away and all of that stuff will come this week the same thing
6863623 were going to play the first half and maybe a series in the third quarter
6863624 you want to come out and be clean be smooth and efficient and put the ball in the end zone i have a good feeling about it
6863625 theres no bigger week than this week because were game planning for buffalo were going to play a little longer and make adjustments throughout the game hopefully well put a good performance together and get some confidence up so when we do play against chicago it will be clean
6863626 every pilot has a bag of luck and a bag of experience
6863627 ive never seen the level of activism i now see
6863628 the number of people who have become more active and visible on the national political front has increased dramatically because people have suddenly sensed that they have to be more active in order to defend themselves as americans defend themselves as arabs and muslims

6863641 we know what is the best position for gerrard but he is capable of playing in other positions
6863642 we know where he can play really well and we know where he likes to play we will concentrate on using him to his strengths
6863643 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6863644 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6863645 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days

6863660 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately we see those forces now having advanced on to the soil of georgia georgian territorial integrity is in question here
6863661 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
6863662 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen

6863683 boc knowingly assisted hamas and the islamic jihad to carry out terrorist attacks with the full approval of the chinese government and rejected requests by the israeli government to cease and desist
6863684 boc even had the chutzpah impudence to make these funds transfers through its u s branches right under the nose of the u s justice department despite the fact that hamas and the pij are designated terrorist organizations and that such wire transfers are a crime under american law

6863694 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6863695 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6863696 not one stone here will be left on another every one will be thrown down
6863697 we are ready to consider requests from the syrian side on buying more arms

6863715 obwohl du die spiele so mochtest gab es etwas das du verbessern wolltest
6863716 ja da gab es einige dinge ich denke einige davon werden klar wenn man sich das ansieht was wir auf der wwi gezeigt haben ich sehe die diablo serie als einen interessanten mix aus action und rpg und als rpg begeisterte es und es begeisterte nochmehr als actiongames aber nicht so sehr wie es m glich gewesen w re was es sehr gut machte waren die drops das suchtpotential aber trotzdem fehlte dem spiel als actiongame noch etwas man hatte einen charakter mit nahezu unendlich viel leben unendlich viel kraft der schneller laufen konnte als alles andere in dieser welt das einzige was man gegen solche charaktere tun konnte war sie zu t ten so war es in diablo 2 man spielte hatte spa und aus dem nichts war man pl tzlich tot das war der einzige zeitpunkt an dem das spiel wirklich eine herausforderung war aber mit solchen harten momenten konnte man dem spieler auch schnell die lust verderben also war es unser zeil das spiel zu einer herausforderung zu machen ohne den anfang des spiels zu schwer zu machen durch unser neues system leben zur ck zu gewinnen haben wir die m glichkeit das spiel fordernd zu machen ohne zu starke monster das ist gut weil es bedeutet dass ein monster eine bedrohung ist weil es dich niederwerfen dich verlangsamen dich in eine falle locken kann aber gleichzeitig nicht so viel schaden macht wir versuchten davon weg zu kommen dass der schaden die einzige bedrohung ist wir haben versucht ein system zu schaffen in dem verlangsamung und die art wie man leben zur ck gewinnt dadurch beeinflusst wird wo man gerade steht das er ffnet neue taktische m glichkeiten

6863900 for the first time a presidential platform publicly and formally commits to amending past trade deals ending more nafta style agreements and reforming institutions like the g8 and world trade organization
6863901 this platform gives a clear indication for the first time where the democratic party is on fair trade
6863902 its important to see a movement away from failed trade models of the past
6863903 the obama agenda describes trade as a positive international tool for bringing about enforceable labor and environmental standards human rights poverty alleviation and climate control this is a major step forward
6863904 theyve hit on several of the most egregious unfair trade practices including currency manipulation lax consumer standards and violations of environmental standards
6863905 more importantly theyve promised to stand firm against future agreements that fail to live up to these benchmarks this will allow american farmers to better compete on a more level playing field
6863906 will stop the government from protecting the environment food safety or the health of its citizens give greater rights to foreign investors than to u s investors require the privatization of our vital public services or prevent developing country governments from adopting humanitarian licensing policies to improve access to life saving medications
6863907 the platform includes welcome statements about trade helping to alleviate poverty in the developing world
6863908 but to do that the u s will have to fully respect the right of developing countries to safeguard and nurture their own domestic economies and to promote and protect their own small holder farmers urban workers and domestic manufacturers
6863909 the language outlines a vision of trade that will serve the needs of the many instead of the few
6863910 agreements should act as a tool to alleviate poverty and increase human rights across the world trade can be an instrument of development for both ourselves and our trading partners

6863945 the university of utah is very pleased to host our first campus wide orientation program for new and returning native students our hope is to ensure that all american indian students make a personal connection with the many people programs and services available to them at the u who support their academic and personal success
6863946 its very important that american indian students begin to engage with other native students as well as the campus community in general upon arrival to the university its important for them to know that they are not the only ones going through the student experience the students themselves are helping to create a campus community
6863947 it is crucial that we reach out to american indian students and their families we want to make the u a welcoming place and for the students to feel there is support for them every day american indians feel unwelcome and strangers in their own country we want to help them reach their potential
6863948 an important function of the american indian resource center is to serve as a home away from home for american indian alaska native students events such as these let students know that we care about their success and we are here for them

6863966 youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
6863967 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating

6863973 worth mentioning is that the movie was directed by the limp bizkit frontman fred durst
6863974 limp bizkit frontman fred durst who made his directorial debut with 2007s little seen the education of charlie banks brings a workmanlike efficiency to the longshots but not much style apart from a few sequences in which he wanders away from the action to explore mindens ragged brick streets and crumbling buildings and even those shots seem obligatory and lacking in inspiration its almost always rewarding to watch an underdog triumph what else could explain why movies exactly like this keep being made but longshots is one underdog thats hard to love and harder still to champion
6863975 saddled with such a predictable plot and script limp bizkit frontman fred durst moonlighting as movie director delivers a mildly diverting tale but because the longshots never escapes the sense of being too contrived it never really gets the crowd on its feet
6863976 former limp bizkit frontman fred durst directs in a surprisingly dull fashion and most of the characters including jasmines mother and father are numbingly one dimensional however the saga is an undeniably heartwarming one about perseverance hard work and pride in community and who could criticize that
6863977 fred durst from the group limp bizkit directs with the unsophisticated simplicity that the story requires and in a time when so many movies throw in so much casual profanity its heartening to see one where the characters even in the most cathartic stressful moments are able to express themselves honestly and forcefully without cursing that attitude earns the longshots a solid recommendation for all audiences
6863978 i bet that will be used out of context against me

6864089 if you were stranded on an island with only your dog and you ran out of all other food would you kill your dog and eat him
6864090 lets say you had a cow and you really loved your cow and treated her really well then lets say that cow gave birth but the baby died of natural causes would you milk the cow and drink the milk
6864091 if your dog had a litter of puppies and all the puppies died would you milk the mother and drink it
6864092 the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for ever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us
6864093 all have sinned and come short of the glory of god

6864107 forgery in relation with a spieler by what name a youngling man
6864108 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6864109 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6864110 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6864111 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6864112 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6864113 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6864114 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6864115 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6864116 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6864117 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6864118 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6864119 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6864120 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6864121 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6864122 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6864123 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6864124 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6864125 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6864126 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6864127 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6864128 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6864129 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6864130 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6864131 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6864132 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6864133 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6864134 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6864135 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6864136 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6864137 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6864138 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6864139 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6864140 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6864141 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6864142 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6864143 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6864144 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6864145 this was a senseless and preventable death said deputy attorney general amy haddix
6864146 she elevated the quality of life of these dogs above the safety of their neighbors

6864159 youre just going to have to hear from the campaign and theyll make the announcement when theyre ready
6864160 my mom in kansas city loves it when someone will talk about me as vp

6864167 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6864168 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6864169 youll probably want to vote republican again wed love to claim otherwise but we just dont have anything to offer this time around
6864170 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6864171 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6864172 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6864173 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6864174 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6864175 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6864176 this is one of the most creative and popular products we sell
6864177 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6864178 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6864179 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6864180 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6864181 forgery in relation with a spieler by what name a youngling man
6864182 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6864183 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6864184 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6864185 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6864186 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6864187 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6864188 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6864189 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6864190 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6864191 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6864192 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6864193 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6864194 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6864195 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6864196 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6864197 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6864198 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6864199 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6864200 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6864201 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6864202 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

6864204 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival here
6864205 he tells me that his trial in vietnam was a charade was a travesty of justice
6864206 hes pleased to be back because there is a possibility that for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6864207 i have served my time i want to put it all behind me and live my life
6864208 his lewd acts have compromised the dignity of the vietnamese people law and common sense and therefore it is necessary to punish him
6864209 hasta el cierre de finales de julio tenemos en el registro electoral 16 millones 700 mil inscritos o sea venezolanas y venezolanos que se han inscrito desde la jornada especial que desarrollamos desde el 3 de marzo hasta finales de julio y hemos podido constatar que de esa cantidad de nuevos inscritos el 82 por ciento corresponde a personas j venes entre 18 y 25 a os de edad

6864211 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6864212 both the parties have agreed on this the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6864213 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6864214 the suspicious agreement means eternal bondage it violates the iraqi constitution

6864217 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
6864218 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6864219 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6864220 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6864221 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6864222 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6864223 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6864224 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6864225 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6864226 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6864227 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6864228 way that is instant although maybe not long lasting gratification
6864229 the thing the sixties did was show us the possibilities and the responsibility that we all had it wasnt the answer it just gave us a glimpse of the possibility
6864230 of course a shortcut isnt easy if it was easy itd just be the way
6864231 boy didnt we just tell you not to do that
6864232 total sales by the big three carriers will amount to 3 5 million iphones within the next two years
6864233 this number 3 5 million could turn out to be inflated the operators could lose money because they took all risks upon themselves having failed to dictate terms to retail chains through which they will sell the iphones

6864242 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6864243 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6864244 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

6864271 frau sch neborn sie haben mit dem ersten deutschen olympiasieg seit 72 jahren im modernen f nfkampf sportgeschichte geschrieben wie f hlt man sich dabei
6864272 ich bin v llig berw ltigt der gl cklichste mensch der welt die siegerehrung war ein wechselbad der gef hle f r mich ich wusste nicht ob ich lachen oder weinen sollte ich glaube ich habe beides gemacht als die deutsche nationalhymne gespielt wurde bekam ich eine g nsehaut
6864273 haben sie aufgrund der 19 sekunden vorsprung vor dem abschlie enden 3000 m lauf fest mit gold gerechnet
6864274 ich wusste dass ich schnell laufen kann also war mir eine medaille so gut wie sicher aber f r gold musste ich verdammt hart arbeiten denn heather fell lie sich nicht absch tteln
6864275 auch beim reiten haben sie nervenst rke bewiesen obwohl tags zuvor viele m nner vom pferd gefallen waren hatten sie keine angst
6864276 ich hatte deshalb richtig bammel da waren ble st rze dabei und au erdem ist das eigentlich meine wackeldisziplin aber mit dem pferd xingxing hatte ich ein gl ckliches h ndchen
6864277 wie gehen sie damit um so pl tzlich im rampenlicht zu stehen
6864278 um ehrlich zu sein ich wei noch gar nicht so recht was ich machen soll das ganze interesse an mir die viele fragen das ist alles sch n aber f r eine f nfk mpferin eher ungew hnlich ich versuche so gut wie m glich damit umzugehen
6864279 kann ihr triumph der au er bei olympia kaum beachteten sportart zu mehr popularit t verhelfen

6864293 moore desired to influence board members to vote to replace dulin with a black person and moore succeeded in this attempt
6864294 i have no idea why they asked me give a deposition i dont have a dog in the hunt
6864295 the primary motivation of the black members in voting to replace dulin was to give the position to a black person
6864296 weve got to make it reflect the demographics of people by race it has no business staying the same

6864302 many health care providers routinely face pressure to change their medical practice often in direct opposition to their personal convictions
6864303 but health care providers shouldnt have to check their conscience at the hospital door this proposed rule will help ensure that doesnt happen
6864304 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6864305 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6864306 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6864307 examples of potential applications include airports offices or other buildings that could be rigged to supply power to laptops mobile telephones or other devices toted into them
6864308 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields
6864309 today the commission tells comcast to stop and to disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage traffic on a going forward basis
6864310 we therefore take another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
6864311 we invite free press a complainant in the case and other members of the public to keep a watchful eye on comcast as it carries out this relief
6864312 using the information provided by comcast pursuant to this order as well as information submitted by the public we will closely monitor the companys network management practices
6864313 this order marks a major milestone in internet policy for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6864314 if you can visit them or attend the memorial service do if you can offer your presence it will be appreciated even if you cannot offer any words at all just be there just that is enough because we the parents know that there are no words

6864317 i could write a better book than the one i just bought
6864318 i dont have to turn into a firefighter or cancer specialist or sweater knitter in order to improve my relationship to my fellow human beings we all have a role to play why not try to play it well
6864319 we try to look for the best ones but theres no magic to any given market and things are cheaper than they were a year ago in markets here and in markets around the world
6864320 so everything is more attractive generally speaking both here and in germany and the uk and korea and you name it and i just try to look for the things i understand the best and that also are selling for less than i think theyre worth
6864321 people who think that america is not in the game are totally wrong
6864322 but we have been importing like 17 percent of gdp gross domestic product if we have that gap and it continues the dollar over time will get weaker not necessarily next week or next month or next year but it will get weaker over time
6864323 i think it is going to be longer and deeper but no one knows when what you do know is that it will turn around
6864324 i mean the country will be doing far better five years from now than it is now but it wont be in my judgment it probably wont be doing better five months from now
6864325 there was an explosion in a medical chamber and a horse was put down by a vet
6864326 den y a litigant the opportunity to vindicate his or her rights in the arbitral forum
6864327 when the cost of arbitration is large in absolute terms and th e cost is significantly larger than the cost of a trial
6864328 arbitration award is not self enforcing an action at law such as a contract action is an appropriate vehicle for enforcing the award
6864329 the way i see it if and when it is approved it will be a niche product
6864330 but i am going to take the responsibility and try to work with it and get better and as you guys can see i have a long long ways to go
6864331 i wasnt half bad but we did run a lot of option

6864338 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6864339 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6864340 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6864341 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6864342 harry potter moving out gave us an opportunity to get a little closer to the holidays bond has a really good history of not only playing through thanksgiving but going deep into the christmas holidays
6864343 if you are asking if i had an orgasm yes it was a job sir
6864344 i didnt have pleasure doing this i was paid to do it
6864345 hes back with the team hes on campus hes just not eligible
6864346 as long as he goes to class does what hes supposed to do as long as he crosses his ts and dots his is hes part of the family
6864347 hes been great with the speed work agility he really got into it hes not into the power lifting anymore hes a phenomenal specimen
6864348 i hope he knows whats at stake theres been a lot of conversations over the years about going to class and doing the right thing im hoping the light in him went on and he understands whats ahead of him
6864349 i know hes matured i know he knows this is his last opportunity
6864350 hes a tremendous football talent he has a great future ahead of him
6864351 thats perhaps an extreme way of saying it i just wanted to live an obscure life in baltimore
6864352 it was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
6864353 i really couldnt tell you perhaps at some point we can do a dna test and find out
6864354 i never said that stated that in any specific way one way or the other
6864355 im innocent im going to walk out of this place with my head held high
6864356 right now the family is in there hugging and enjoying time as a family together

6864361 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6864362 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6864363 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6864364 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6864365 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6864366 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6864367 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6864368 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6864369 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6864370 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6864371 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6864372 im not going to participate because those people dont care about me
6864373 i will tell that old story again and again i will pour it out full beyond this now i will use it for im a migrant too alive between two worlds where another spreading sings
6864374 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6864375 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6864376 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6864377 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6864378 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6864379 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6864380 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6864381 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6864382 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6864404 we found that early life infections recurrent otitis having a dog as a newborn and growing up in a larger family was independent of each other and independent of other confounders related to snoring in adulthood
6864405 this is a very general study based on a questionnaire that simply was distributed to a large number of subjects you could find statistical significance however the meaning of this significance to the clinical arena is unclear
6864406 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does its damage in ra related bone loss
6864407 enables us to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but is exciting nonetheless

6864425 for people with obesity and reflux together the gastric bypass procedure appears to be effective not only for weight loss but also for the control of reflux symptoms
6864426 because in this case most of the acid from the stomach is being partitioned away so it doesnt have exposure to the esophagus
6864427 however with gastric banding the problem is that you actually create a pocket which acid has the ability to fill from the remainder portion of the stomach
6864428 and this acid can just sit there above the band and make its way back up to the esophagus this can cause reflux disease to develop or make it worse than it had been if it was a problem before the procedure
6864429 gastric bypass is the most common and the most successful of the surgical procedures to deal with obesity
6864430 but the advantage to the banding procedure is that although it will not be an effective option for all patients depending on the level of obesity its a lot less aggressive than bypass and has a lot less morbidity associated with it and its much more reversible so there are reasons some patients might choose that option
6864431 it was a part of our marketing strategy the concept was thought up at orange poland

6864435 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6864436 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6864437 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6864438 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6864439 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6864440 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6864441 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6864442 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6864443 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6864444 but he said this project really looked like it was doable

6864554 the international crisis in georgia has reminded americans that they should perhaps choose a president with experience who is able to respond with firmness and determination in a world where the interests of the united states are being increasingly challenged mccains strategists have succeeded quite well in defining the choice between the two men the republican campaign has made spectacular progress in recent weeks by entering a hyper offensive phase
6864555 the convention in denver will be even more decisive than these generally grand celebrations of partisanship usually are its success or failure will depend on three issues will obamas arrival there transform his character onto something more presidential will he finally add substance to his slogan of change and above all will he succeed in imposing the terms of debate for the rest of the campaign and the three televised duels with mccain
6864556 while we wait to hear of obamas decision one may wonder why he waited until the last minute leaving the field open to his rival before the conventions

6864576 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6864577 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6864578 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6864579 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6864580 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6864581 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6864582 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6864583 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6864584 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6864585 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6864586 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6864587 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6864588 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6864589 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6864590 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6864591 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6864592 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6864593 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6864594 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6864595 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6864596 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6864597 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6864598 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6864599 its hard for the teacher to give the one to one attention every student deserves
6864600 i feel we are getting into the unsafe territory because it is too large amount of people in one space

6864602 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011 mr hammoud said
6864603 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6864604 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6864605 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6864606 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire
6864607 the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
6864608 last night around 2 a m some people were attending a holy koran recitation in shindand district when americans started bombing tens of civilians were killed
6864609 more than 30 people have been killed i cannot say how many of them are civilians
6864610 when negotiations are hopefully coming to an end when you can see the end in sight there are a lot of details that have to be worked out and i think were in the process of working out details right now
6864611 of course the thing that everyone is concerned about is the release of the grant funds
6864612 we have committed to go back and within as quick a period of time as possible to work with our program offices share the information weve gathered and reach a decision
6864613 weve seen a lot of hard work from the gpss staff
6864614 weve tested you this week and we prodded you at a busy time and we apologize for that all of our observations indicate that its a good crew there are a lot of good people back there and it is moving forward because of you
6864615 our expectation is that we do have some regular updates
6864616 and when we come back we will be back again in a few months those are the things we are going to be concentrating on
6864617 that money that is coming is for our children and that is our responsibility
6864618 our kids cannot just go off island and get an education in the states like military kids so we need to preserve that education we have here
6864619 with the corrective action plan and the activities that they are putting in place they are on the route to doing what they need to for us the question is can the leadership hold together long enough to implement those corrections
6864620 the crucial areas that must become a priority are financial management internal audit function fixed asset inventory and procurement operations
6864621 beginning to evolve into a cohesive staff that is focused on improving accountability
6864622 what lujan is presenting may be a point of argument in the court case so right now we will leave that determination to the judicial system
6864623 thats going to be one of the key issues i would imagine
6864624 the recent arrests of chinese who wanted to stage demonstrations or express themselves during the olympic games were examples of this desire on the part of the authorities to target their own citizens rather than the thousands of foreign journalists
6864625 talks about subjects such as tibet xinjiang taiwan and falun gong or criticises the party or government but is not behaving outrageously
6864626 speak to the interviewee in accordance with chinese legislation and to follow and monitor the journalist
6864627 i backpacked a few times in high school and college but only got into it ok im a little obsessed in the last few months im a busy seminary student but whenever we can my wife and i hike in kentuckys red river gorge
6864628 did washington purposely encourage an irresponsible and unpredictable regime in this misadventure
6864629 we certainly would not want to have same kind of democracy as they have in iraq quite honestly
6864630 im trying to get more information regarding this and im having my staff look into that a little further
6864631 the unfortunate thing about that is the people living there are put in this situation and are going to be displaced
6864632 the immediate concern is to take care of the families that will be displaced
6864633 we have to come in there and see what we can do if we can do something i think we can
6864634 i really want to consolidate all housing entities to be under a program be it guam housing or ghura whichever best fits the need of our growing population
6864635 can it happen again nothings impossible but at least you have the safeguards in place
6864636 thereafter all these individuals became a part of their budget
6864637 since they no longer provide housing for teachers they decided to transfer them to the maintenance division at dpw
6864638 it would be absurd for the government to financially penalise schools with lower results these schools are often the ones in the most challenging catchment areas
6864639 there is a strong case for funding all schools at the specialist status level and then providing additional top ups on the basis of deprivation
6864640 with intent to obtain or confer a benefit or to injure another person or deprive another person of a benefit
6864641 russians have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6864642 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6864643 noted that a process of withdrawing russian forces has begun and that this should continue and finish in conformity with commitments by the russian side
6864644 mi informaci n es que no se han retirado completamente de reas consideradas no disputadas y tienen que hacerlo
6864645 rusia no ha cumplido y que tiene que cumplirlo ahora
6864646 cumplir significa cumplir con el plan y todav a no hemos visto eso
6864647 the point of view of one of plames inside contacts upon discovering her true identity
6864648 there is no evidence that defendants should have known that it could have controlled sykes behavior offsite or that it should have recognized the necessity of doing so
6864649 because it basically says that no matter what a prospective employee tells you including the fact that hes a convicted rapist basically that rapist can come in and do anything he wants including sexually assaulting an 8 year old boy and the employer has absolutely no responsibility and i find that to be appalling and wrong
6864650 despite the fact that sykes had informed fedex kinkos that he had a prior conviction for conduct equivalent to statutory rape defendants could not foresee that hiring sykes as a production manager a position that does not entail intimate contact with members of the public or vulnerable individuals would gain access to a familys home and the opportunity to sexually abuse a child
6864651 why did world trade center building seven collapse nearly seven hours after the twin towers fell
6864652 was it diesel fuel in the building or planted explosives a controlled demolition of government offices as conspiracy theorists allege in films like loose change
6864653 this is the first time that were aware of that a building over 15 stories tall has collapsed primarilly due to fire
6864654 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6864655 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6864656 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6864657 investigators said they did consider certain so called conspiracy theories reported cnn
6864658 alternative theories are really none of them have been found to be credible
6864659 i maintain that nbc s line up would me much healthier today if they had kept aw canceling it alienated a lot of their core viewers
6864660 the patients themselves are saying yeah i think its the gnats
6864661 theyre relatively minor but people are missing work or school
6864662 apparently allergy to these flies does exist but it is very rare even in mushroom workers who are exposed to them every day
6864663 can they cause allergic skin reactions i would estimate that 99 9 percent of those of us who come in contact with these gnats either in our hair or on our skin will not have any allergic skin reactions
6864664 but there may be some individuals who in fact are more sensitive to insects and show some skin allergies if these gnats are crushed into the skin as they are being slapped
6864665 i dont take things so seriously when it comes to fashion were not curing cancer were making clothing
6864666 i cant really talk about it because im under contract
6864667 i watched the first movie several times and i did watch some gilmore girls
6864668 id done a lot of theater growing up so this tv show was just one of the many things that ive done obviously i had to become aware of the fact that it became the most popular show in england and across europe that was a bit of a struggle to deal with in a way
6864669 but they dont differentiate between quotes from actual critics who work for the web sites and comments left by anonymous readers
6864670 worried about what happens to us if we forgot a piece of paper somewhere that proves our kids only 14
6864671 she elevated the quality of life of these dogs above the safety of their neighbors
6864672 we have seen lots of people taking their dogs for a walk since the establishment of the designated area and we have been inundated by phone calls from happy pet owners thanking and congratulating us for this initiative
6864673 it is not a problem because there is plenty of space it will be moved a couple of hundred metres yards further down
6864674 in older times shepherds used to take sheep and goats there and dunk them in
6864675 the fact that no such beach existed had caused problems between dog owners and people who did not want dogs in the area
6864676 we believe that there should be a beach for dogs in each district
6864677 copyright 2001 2008 we all have seen all kinds of information filling up in search engines when meta description tag is not there or not used properly it saves me from showing my dirty linen or any unwanted information
6864678 hes really getting better and he has the spirit to get better i loved his story i hated what happened to him
6864679 hes never shown any indications that hes a mean dog
6864680 a family is a place where minds come in contact with one another if these minds love one another the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden but if these minds get out of harmony with one another it is like a storm that plays havoc with the garden
6864681 luscita italiana del film prevista per il 19 dicembre 2008
6864682 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
6864683 absolutely exhaustive research was done on her over the course of the 16 month primary she was researched more closely than any candidate in history
6864684 dont worry about anything instead pray about everything tell god what you need and thank him for all he has done then you will experience gods peace which exceeds anything we can understand
6864685 im learning not to give a shit about other peoples perceptions about my girth
6864686 people sure do like to talk to each other social networking increases the number of loose ties and sometimes people meet and get closer also sometimes people neglect community in the real world so maybe the net effect is a loss but it is good for shy people

6864696 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
6864697 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
6864698 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
6864699 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
6864700 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
6864701 the crowds at comic con bring out the primal side of me i have never come so close to actually clocking a complete stranger in the back of the head so i try to stay out of them as much as i can
6864702 i actually came up with the idea when i saw a really loud preacher giving a rabid sermon and if he had been speaking in a language i did not know i would have thought he was cussing out the crowd i decided to create a preacher who cusses in a righteous way

6864706 the campaigns have come to the earliest agreement on presidential debates reached in any general election in recent history
6864707 republicans always always campaign by portraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist while their guy is a man of the people al gore grew up in a penthouse apartment
6864708 they have a lot of fun and do a lot of things we dont condone in the u s but its over
6864709 i never imagined we would win like that against a team like the united states said cuban manager antonio pacheco
6864710 i didnt expect so many runs if you had told me before the game that wed win by such a big margin against such good pitchers id say you were crazy it was a great offensive game for cuba
6864711 they seem to find the hole a lot strasburg said in the understatement of the evening
6864712 they can hit they can pitch and they beat us fair and square as far as if they can play in the major leagues im sure a lot of them can
6864713 id say almost all our players have major league quality but thats not for me to evaluate thats for the scouts to say

6864950 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6864951 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day

6864963 i was hanging around after getting out of the institution this week my money had almost gone so i thought if i caused a scene police would do something for me
6864964 though i see the world as a heterosexual male person my job is to tell a story in a way that makes each character keep its complete integrity no matter if its a man or a woman
6864965 my home was paid for then i got a new roof
6864966 this wave is going to be the leading edge of aging baby boomers
6864967 typically when we think of those seeking job skills and placement assistance we think of those just graduating high school or college these days especially with this economy that just isnt the case
6864968 i need to play well this well this week and next week and so far this week ive done that
6864969 if nick then feels i am worthy of a pick so be it if not then thats acceptable
6864970 i was just very relaxed out there with the boys sons tyrone and conor here ive got to be on my best behaviour and my attitude is just pretty good
6864971 ive taken a lot of pressure off myself and feel comfortable ive been playing well and im in a good position now
6864972 my two best majors the open and the pga championship got me out of that tight pack
6864973 its exciting to see how the team is going to shape up and i am starting to get the tingle i am really excited about it and i think we are going to have a good time over there
6864974 before leaving they actually kicked one of the employees which appeared to be for no apparent reason
6864975 we dont know if they had a car parked up on the freeway on southbound 280 at the serramonte off ramp and might have jumped in a car or had somebody waiting for them at that point
6864976 we want to know if there is any pattern or any common cause
6864977 these are your questions and believe me these are our questions
6864978 screening levels are set very low to ensure that they are health protective
6864979 found that even if a worker was on site over a 25 year working lifetime the concentrations of lead and arsenic were low enough that no adverse health effects would be expected
6864980 i hope weve changed the way we do democratic politics in this country
6864981 and i think it will lead to the election of barack obama as president
6864982 i think it remains to be seen but so far i feel my approach has been the right one we have a congressional majority in some large proportions in the house and i think were going to certainly gain in the senate and where were going to gain in the senate is places like virginia and alaska and colorado and new mexico all states that voted for bush in 2004 thats essentially expanding the playing field which is what this is all about
6864983 as many people know governor dean was not my first choice to become head of the dnc nor was he necessarily my second choice
6864984 but the success of his 50 state strategy has made a big believer out of me
6864985 the 50 state strategy has helped bring more people into the process democrats from barack obama to house candidates across the country are competing in even bright red states this will be a great democratic year
6864986 i truly believe that we are much more unified than the media is writing about because of their tendency to focus on the nail that sticks up rather than whats really going on
6864987 a different person with closer relationships with some people might have been able to push people around howard wasnt able to push people around
6864988 im a huge fan of hillarys and always have been
6864989 my own view is this party desperately needed to be shaken up and turned around and weve done that i believe were going to win the presidency but i dont think were going to go back to the old days of trying to eke out a victory by six electoral votes and focus on just 20 states i dont think were going to go back to that model anymore
6864990 people should also try plantain cassava and jerk chicken which is part of west african and caribbean cuisine
6864991 have we seen a need for a second constable at this point
6864992 if we have i suggest we look into it more closely
6864993 because of accounting differences weve had they should have laid the groundwork so that the 2007 audit would be in shape
6864994 both as a result of the allegations with regard to the former city administrator and also because of the level of crime people are not feeling good about the city government so we have a lot of work to do
6864995 ill have to say i love you in a song
6864996 i gave you all my love where did you follow
6864997 you last appointment was late sept 08 so you cant see the dr before then or your insurance wont cover it
6864998 the good that has come out of that is that the shock one can only imagine the shock seems to have brought him to his senses
6864999 this is like a gold for me after what ive been through and i wouldnt have said that before
6865000 i hope i dont wake up grumpy but it is such a relief
6865001 it would have been nice to have a medal but ive already got one and there are some insanely competitive paddlers out there who havent
6865002 i was thinking i could sneak a gold out there
6865003 i wasnt really looking i just had my head in my own boat and i felt if i looked across it wouldnt boost my confidence
6865004 i just wanted to finish my race and put in as much physically as i could that was reflected with 100m to go when i got the wobbles
6865005 im going to chill and reconnect with the wider perspective of life
6865006 the last four years have been so intense and there is a little bit more to life than that
6865007 ive hammered myself 24 hours a day seven days a week for four years so its taken its toll i need to take some time out and hopefully comeback with a healthier approach to the game
6865008 we got to the final 100m and i thought this is the olympics and put more effort into every stroke but we fell apart in that final 100m and other crews came through on the inside

6865014 all animals including humans have a very similar set of basic genes and yet were so different

6865016 to pick and choose the traits of animal groups that you most enjoy oh my gosh i love this
6865017 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend

6865135 randy camps conduct while married to my sister was horrible he was having several affairs right under our noses his actions have resulted in at least two broken marriages and damage to others families in both crockett and gibson counties have been hurt by all of this lisa also received anonymous letters from nashville telling her of extramarital affairs as well
6865136 mr camp contends that the trial court erred in awarding ms camp alimony in futuro rather than rehabilitative alimony and in setting alimony at an inappropriately high amount mr camp asserts that as the trial court found ms camp is a healthy and intelligent woman who is capable of earning 25 000 to 40 000 per year depending on whether she completes her bachelors degree he argues that the parties did not enjoy a lavish lifestyle during the course of their marriage and that in light of the division of property ms camp is able to maintain a lifestyle similar to that enjoyed prior to the divorce and does not need alimony in futuro
6865137 im just a country boy standin up for my sister
6865138 if camp had just waited a year or two nobody in this family would have said a word about any of this
6865139 after nearly twenty years of infidelity and two years fighting in court we all thought it was finally over then thirty days after the court decided for lisa mr camp announced his candidacy how he could even think about running for office at this point in time is unbelievable

6865144 my ex wife got quite a bit of property up front and she is capable of working i was simply trying to get more money to my children the judge made his decision though and thats the end of it

6865151 clearly in a couple of weeks he will be back to his best he has needed time to get fit after his injuries and it has been important to protect him
6865152 steven has great game intelligence and he can play anywhere gerrard played with intelligence and england drew that is all i would want to say about it
6865153 we know what is the best position for gerrard but he is capable of playing in other positions
6865154 we know where he can play really well and we know where he likes to play we will concentrate on using him to his strengths
6865155 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6865156 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6865157 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days
6865158 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad

6865160 likewise there has been nothing more on xabi alonso at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player

6865162 we have had an approach from stoke about sami but we want to keep him
6865163 when we talked about a new contract in the summer it was clear that sami wanted to stay at the club

6865166 we dont try to hide that but as publishers we see it as a fantasy game its fantasy violence its over the top its cartoony
6865167 we also take the violence very seriously we are working with the age rating boards with pegi and with bbfc were not at the end of the games development but were working with them now to make sure that we dont go over the top
6865168 the game has been banned in germany theres no getting around that unfortunately but we are taking it seriously and were going to make sure that this game is rated for the appropriate audience
6865169 it was okay mom there is not much time for playin though
6865170 i think t j needs more time than he thinks he needs to be ready to play ill tell you that i think for the runner its not quite as significant we want to see him and make sure he can withstand it i think for t j theres more to it things change things have changed when youre not out there and doing it things move within the snap of the football so its important that t j gets some snaps going and gets going here hes a very smart guy he understands football very well and understands the offense and the nuances of what were doing very well but until youre doing it there are going to be some things now you start working to a game plan and everythings limited and it comes down but yeah its important for them to get some snaps and some time
6865171 im sick to my stomach because you think of all the hard work you put in
6865172 i put in a lot of hard work in the off season i made 100 percent of my workouts in the off season and then theres training camp that was the hardest training camp id been in and then for this to happen i felt like i had a lot of room to grow im not near my max potential thats what gets me as well theres a lot of things mentally and physically i could improve upon now its more mental which i know will make me a better player in the future
6865173 my only concern is the affect it may have on the players perception of marvin lewis he was definitely over ridden on this issue by brown
6865174 i want to make it so they the coaches have to make a decision i want to be taken seriously
6865175 i have this team pegged for about 7 wins but that 7 could easily be 8 or 9
6865176 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment

6865188 superman returns didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

6865204 amazing a musical journey to take listeners to another plane of reality
6865205 we walked up kind of sort of close to it within about 8 or 9 feet up to that point it seemed excited but not really agitated
6865206 we had heard stories of these things because they are such a powerful bird such a big bird with big claws and stuff could possible hurt us so we were a little concerned about that
6865207 i think we had exhausted the fact that we werent going to be able to just corral it up on our own without harming it
6865208 i guess the point was made well what do we have other than shooting it with an actual gun to get rid of it
6865209 dont let your hearts be troubled trust in god and trust also in me there is more than enough room in my fathers home if this were not so would i have told you that i am going to prepare a place for you when everything is ready i will come and get you so that you will always be with me where i am and you know the way to where i am going
6865210 we have no idea where you are going so how can we know the way
6865211 i am the way the truth and the life no one can come to the father except through me if you had really known me you would know who my father is from now on you do know him and have seen him
6865212 lord show us the father and we will be satisfied
6865213 have i been with you all this time philip and yet you still dont know who i am
6865214 to grow up with one parent who is black and another who is white
6865215 there are some bad adolescent behaviors that whites do more than blacks like drinking and smoking and there are other bad adolescent behaviors that blacks do more than whites watching tv fighting getting sexually transmitted diseases
6865216 in 1920 marriages to whites comprised roughly 0 3 of black marriages by 2000 interracial marriages increased dramatically 5 9 of married black men chose a white bride and 2 7 of black women chose a white husband
6865217 mixed race births steadily increase over time accounting for one in 200 births by the 1980s and one in 70 births in 2000
6865218 using data from the national survey of adolescent health add health which surveys over 90 000 individuals who were in grades 7 12 in the 1994 95 school year our empirical analysis of the plight of mixed race adolescents unearths a rich set of new facts

6865226 the obvious result is that a wrongful death action may expire before the decedent does

6865238 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6865239 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6865240 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6865241 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6865242 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6865243 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6865244 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6865245 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6865246 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6865247 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6865248 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6865249 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6865250 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6865251 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6865252 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6865253 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6865254 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6865255 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6865256 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6865257 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6865258 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6865259 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6865260 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6865261 sorry to interrupt you but the ceiling is crashing i dont want to be in here when it falls completely the walls are caving in just like i thought they would last week

6865265 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6865266 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6865267 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6865268 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6865269 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6865270 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6865271 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6865272 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6865273 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6865274 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6865275 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6865276 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6865277 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6865278 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6865279 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6865280 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6865281 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6865282 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6865283 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6865284 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6865285 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6865286 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6865287 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6865288 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6865289 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6865290 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6865291 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6865292 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6865293 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6865294 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
6865295 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6865296 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6865297 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6865298 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6865299 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6865300 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is

6865304 i am a man i cannot give birth i cannot legally have access to a womans body unless she gives me permission so i have no right to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body no man on this planet unless the child is half his has a right to even offer his opinion on the matter because we arent women its a personal rights issue not a state matter
6865305 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6865306 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6865307 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6865308 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6865309 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6865310 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6865311 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6865312 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6865313 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6865314 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6865315 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6865316 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6865317 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6865318 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color

6865322 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6865323 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
6865324 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
6865325 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
6865326 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
6865327 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
6865328 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
6865329 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
6865330 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
6865331 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
6865332 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
6865333 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
6865334 thats right for todays assignment were going to look through the ads in the sunday paper and were going to make fathers day cards for our fathers try to find a picture that looks like your father and children on this fathers day we should also remember the most important father of all our lord

6865351 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6865352 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6865353 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours

6865371 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6865372 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6865373 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6865374 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6865375 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office

6865379 if any of you lacks wisdom he should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to him but when he asks he must believe and not doubt because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind that man should not think he will receive anything from the lord he is a double minded man unstable in all he does
6865380 if any of you lacks wisdom he should ask god who gives generously he must believe and not doubt
6865381 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
6865382 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6865383 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6865384 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6865385 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6865386 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6865387 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6865388 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6865389 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program

6865393 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6865394 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died ann entire town destroyed
6865395 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
6865396 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
6865397 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
6865398 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
6865399 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
6865400 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6865401 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals

6865406 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6865407 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6865408 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6865409 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6865410 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6865411 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6865412 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6865413 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6865414 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6865415 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country

6865468 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6865469 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6865470 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6865471 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6865472 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6865473 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6865474 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters

6865478 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6865479 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6865480 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6865481 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6865482 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6865483 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6865484 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6865485 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6865486 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction

6865688 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6865689 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6865690 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6865691 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

6865695 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6865696 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6865697 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

6865700 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6865701 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes

6865706 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6865707 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6865708 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6865709 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6865710 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6865711 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6865712 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees

6865727 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6865728 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6865729 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6865730 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6865731 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own
6865732 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it

6865736 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
6865737 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate

6865739 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
6865740 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects

6865745 no one should be allowed to decide for someone else that an innocent life is worthless
6865746 pro life health care workers should be allowed to abide by their beliefs
6865747 regulations by the department of health and human services should rightly recognize that abortion whether caused by drugs or any other method is still abortion protecting health care workers who have a moral objection to participating in such abortions is consistent with laws that have been on the books for decades
6865748 will not require involvement in procedures that violate an individuals conscience as part of any part of any health service program
6865749 despite the allegations of fringe pro abortion groups broadly applying the conscience protection to include objection to the abortion of embryos before implantation is legally unassailable
6865750 such a scope is supported by the language and context of the statutes as well as relevant medical science and legislative history the department should ignore the rhetoric of abortion extremists who themselves oppose rights of conscience and instead adopt proposed regulations protecting conscience in this broad manner

6865759 at the beginning b20 was eight to 12 cents cheaper than diesel
6865760 then it became 20 cents more expensive than diesel right now its even with diesel what we learned from this is that fleets need to look at the economics closely adjusting their blend if they need to based on pricing changes

6865772 its not the data that gives you the advantage but implementing it into schemes and then having the players on the floor execute it
6865773 with yao injured last season we went from using him on post ups to having mcgrady triggering everything off of the pick and roll or high action

6865794 it has not paid to sell america short since 1776 and the time to start is not in 2008

6865825 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

6865908 it was a pretty good day for team target we were dominant early on and the car was really good early on in the stint i think where we struggled was toward the end of the stint it didnt seem to be a problem early on because the other guys were falling off too briscoe you have to give him credit he drove the wheels off that thing he could really take advantage of the high line when i tried a couple of times and nearly ended up in the fence it was the most fun ive had in a long time to be honest it was a hell of a race towards the end im just glad it didnt come down to traffic being the deciding factor and it almost was with briscoe almost being taken out by those guys crashing it was a tough race im a little disappointed we didnt come up with the win but its fantastic points for the championship
6865909 i had a car that was just a little conservative so thats why it was difficult for me to run up high for the most part i think it was a pretty good race racing kind of swayed back and forth

6865922 one thing i want to point to is the low cpu utilisation on the amd desktop it was 10 30 and about 70 on the intel pc one of the reasons why this is important on the desktop because once you get a cpu utilisation above a certain threshold your fan kicks in the systems starts to get a lot hotter and probably more importantly is that youre going need that extra cpu space if your background tasks kicks in as you are watching a movie this could be windows defender it could be a virus protection and in this example we are kicking on an itunes audio encode from a wav file to aac the amd systems utilisation is a bit higher and intels reached 100 and youll see some frames dropping

6865947 these numbers are more realistic than what the street had been anticipating i dont think the buy side was expecting the third and fourth quarter to be positive the sell side analysts are just slow to catch up
6865948 most of this is related to the macroeconomic environment which has forced consumers to rein in their spending
6865949 its a bear market the other sectors are going to feel it in their profits too

6865961 ignores how those structures were assembled the source and conditions of the labor the lack of pollution controls in beijing and throughout china the many complaints that chinese infrastructure outside the olympics zone remains shoddy the recent record of chinese manufacturing scandals including the heparin fiasco which killed many americans and of course the catastrophe brought about by chinese building standards in the region rocked by the recent earthquake
6865962 severe power shortages across china especially in the manufacturing hub and export engine of guangdong are expected to add further pressure on exports in the second half of the year
6865963 scores of chinese air passengers have smashed computers and desks and clashed with police after a night stranded at an airport without accommodation state media said frustration at mysterious delays diversions and cancellations have at times boiled over into violence at chinese airports as passengers try to storm grounded aircraft and police are brought in to keep the peace there have also been cases in which passengers after delayed arrivals have refused to get off the planes in protest

6865967 i am deeply troubled by this matter and understand how devastating the announcement of it is to the brazilian community and to the st pius x parish community
6865968 i wish to assure all of you of my prayers at this difficult time i ask that you remember father lima and the individual who has brought forth this accusation in your prayers
6865969 at this point he is still trying to convince him to return

6865975 low birth europe is faced with an ageing population a pensions crisis later retirement changes in work patterns shrinking cities and a massive looming healthcare cost nations of children with no siblings cousins aunts or uncles only parents grandparents and perhaps great grandparents will face the burden of paying for the care of a massive older generation the same prospect of an older more conservative less vigorous or inventive culture looms in china japan and much of the far east
6865976 women without their own income have very little bargaining power inside the home but they can go on baby strike
6865977 many women in the developed world will become overloaded and respond by cutting down the number of children they have
6865978 these recommendations will further enhance motor carrier security by helping the industry adopt security measures best suited for the size and scope of their organizations
6865979 tsa utilized a threat based approach to develop security measures that are reasonable and effective for the industry as a whole
6865980 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6865981 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6865982 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6865983 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6865984 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6865985 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6865986 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture us agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6865987 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6865988 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6865989 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done

6865992 the candidate republicans should be clamoring for is the one liberals are most feverishly denouncing that is mitt romney by a landslide
6865993 he just tripped off a chair he was getting ready to speak somebody aimed a gun at him and him he dove for the floor
6865994 prominent evangelical leaders are warning sen john mccain against picking former massachusetts gov mitt romney as his running mate saying their troops will abandon the republican ticket on election day if that happens
6865995 they say mr romney lacks trust on issues such as outlawing abortion and opposing same sex marriage and because he is a mormon opposition is particularly powerful among those who supported former arkansas gov mike huckabee in the republican presidential primaries earlier this year
6865996 other well placed christian conservatives say that although many evangelical leaders could accept and work for a mccain romney ticket mr huckabees supporters tend to be rabid in their views against mr romney because of his faith they do not regard mormonism as a christian denomination
6865997 i am wholeheartedly convinced that mitt romney can be trusted to uphold the values and principles most important to me as a political conservative and an evangelical christian again i am not being paid and i am not interested in a job in a romney administration i would not accept one even if offered as im still raising three teenagers neither is my public relations firm involved in any way i am involved because i believe the stakes are high perhaps higher than ever before in my life
6865998 august 20 2008 taranto brings to our attention one seth grahame smith who presents his inane hypothesis that white people dont want a black president because it will bring them down a notch
6865999 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal

6866009 the regulation of the internet with relation to speech and expression by the indian state
6866010 no one should be allowed to decide for someone else that an innocent life is worthless
6866011 pro life health care workers should be allowed to abide by their beliefs
6866012 regulations by the department of health and human services should rightly recognize that abortion whether caused by drugs or any other method is still abortion protecting health care workers who have a moral objection to participating in such abortions is consistent with laws that have been on the books for decades
6866013 will not require involvement in procedures that violate an individuals conscience as part of any part of any health service program
6866014 despite the allegations of fringe pro abortion groups broadly applying the conscience protection to include objection to the abortion of embryos before implantation is legally unassailable
6866015 such a scope is supported by the language and context of the statutes as well as relevant medical science and legislative history the department should ignore the rhetoric of abortion extremists who themselves oppose rights of conscience and instead adopt proposed regulations protecting conscience in this broad manner

6866021 we are currently conducting activities necessary to select a potential development candidate
6866022 these results confirm that elesclomol powerfully and selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells by increasing the level of reactive oxygen species ros beyond sustainable levels
6866023 elevated ros levels and susceptibility to further increases in ros are fundamental characteristics of cancer cells that differentiate them from normal non cancerous cells exploiting this special vulnerability represents a novel approach to selectively targeting and killing cancer cells the findings also suggest that elesclomol can substantially enhance the efficacy of certain other anti cancer therapies when given in combination these results collectively indicate the potential of oxidative stress induction as a new therapeutic option for treating multiple types of cancers either as a single agent or in combination we are excited by the potential of this new mechanism category particularly for difficult to treat cancers such as melanoma that have not been responsive to chemotherapy or other prior approaches
6866024 these new findings highlight the potential of oxidative stress induction
6866025 cancer types that may be especially sensitive to this mechanism are those known to have particularly high levels of oxidative stress including melanoma prostate breast ovarian and hematologic cancers

6866067 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6866068 i had an internship down at city hall in easton with the planning and development department the job involved learning and understanding what goes on behind the scenes in the making of a city as far as the development of urban parts of the city i got a hands on opportunity to look at blueprints and the different types of things they were building and to see the different types of people living in certain parts of the city it was interesting and i definitely learned a lot
6866069 preseason has gone great i feel like weve gotten a lot work done especially with the younger guys were trying to develop depth on the team and we have a lot of guys back who have been performing well and i think the younger guys have done a great job of learning the plays and becoming better role players on this team
6866070 its two sided its a good thing because the fewer weeks in camp is better for us players because well be fresher when it comes time to play football in an actual game the downside though is that as a football player were eager to play right now and we have to wait an extra week to see some action
6866071 ive approached it entirely differently coming in as a freshman sophomore and even my junior year i was just putting in the work and getting ready but i wasnt as excited during the preseason now im taking it all in stride and having fun while im out here with the guys i feel like this team has a special bond were like a family out here and im enjoying this preseason more
6866072 i approach it like its a clean slate last year was last year and we have different guys out there now as a member of this team i just have to make sure i go out there and do my job and take care of what i need to take care of im not putting pressure on myself im out there to have fun and be ready to play
6866073 fans may not realize the amount of time we spend with each other from about eight in the morning to 10 at night were in and out of this building we get to build a strong bond during preseason because were around each other so much
6866074 i know its not right for every circumstance for taser guns to be used but that night it happened and then those people are giving out in newspapers that it shouldnt have happened
6866075 not one of them has a clue not one of them has come near the door to ask what happened what didnt happen

6866084 what a day i think we tried to play it kind of safe and just be conservative even in traffic we really didnt rush things the car was fantastic we didnt have as much speed actually as we thought we did especially in practice and qualifying the car was super fast we had a couple of guys that definitely sped up with vitor meira and marco andretti toward the end their cars were very fast it was strategy in the end it was crazy there was no way we were going to catch him he was half the track ahead of us i knew our car was probably quicker than his but not 20 miles per hour faster it was nice to get it the way we did i think about the run that dario franchitti had for the championship last season and its nice to be able to be in that position after how we lost it last year
6866085 it was a very competitive race and i am really happy for scott and all the guys at target chip ganassi i was having trouble finding speed and tony kanaan just wasnt going to let me have it easy but thats good racing i didnt seem to quite have enough it was a good race we lost a lot of spots in the pits on that last one and it is difficult to get them back it seemed i had it going pretty good in the draft but when i got outside i wasnt quite quick enough it was a competitive race and it seemed like we rode pretty well just a little bit short
6866086 nobody wants to talk about it but everyone knows its there

6866097 in an earlier survey on the election and health care reform physicians were fairly evenly divided as to the solution for improving our health care system
6866098 twenty seven percent said it was universal health care with multi payer reimbursement twenty three percent said it was universal health care with single payer reimbursement and twenty five percent selected tax credits to allow more people to afford healthcare
6866099 universal health care would reduce my income in the short term but the longer term effect would be good since the current system isnt sustainable
6866100 more regulatory and bureaucratic hoops to jump through decreased income perhaps a decreased workload as access to care plummets
6866101 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time

6866104 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6866105 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6866106 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6866107 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6866108 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6866109 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6866110 it views any delay to the amended request for proposal for the tanker replacement program as harmful to the warfighter and that a delay will result in a direct escalation in cost to the government thereby harming american taxpayers
6866111 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed

6866140 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6866141 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
6866142 theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is
6866143 theres zero chance of it happening this year its something thats being talked about right now as the game is gaining popularity and looking like its going to be a hit

6866147 its fantastic i think at this point in the championship battle its a must have for team target helio has been very strong in the last two races hes been trying to chase us down but we were able to make a small gain on him this weekend at this point i think a 65 point lead is pretty strong we just have to keep on it for the next four races we need to be consistent and continue to earn points this win was definitely a turn for us in the championship ive got to thank the team we were struggling at the start of the weekend we were probably at best about 11 th so to come through is simply not what we expected but my guys nailed that last pit stop and we got that lead and we were going to be unstoppable
6866148 i absolutely did not have a second place car tonight but sometimes its better to be lucky than good its a great night for target chip ganassi racing in the end to finish 1 2 and the rain seemed to be powered by energizer batteries because it kept coming down i had a lot of drag in the car and it made it very difficult i had to lift a lot in traffic and as i said sometimes it is better to be lucky than good
6866149 the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6866150 the greens are a little bit softer they got a little firm and crusty on us yesterday afternoon a little more difficult to putt on
6866151 our goal is to always surprise and delight our guests with great values and we are disappointed that some of our guests may be inconvenienced by our need to respond to this fraudulent tampering and transferring
6866152 it was a good day for us we started sixth i knew we still had a car to win everything was really crazy today we didnt get into any rhythm everybody knew how it was going to play out and who was doing what and then we had a bad pit stop when we tried to jump helio there and that put us back a little ways so its frustrating but we only lost maybe five points in the championship
6866153 a tough day for the target team today we were obviously on another strategy and we were doing alright and minding our own business on the restart wilson and dominguez got together and i got hit from behind there was really nowhere to go so its unfortunate we came into the pits a few more times to top off and make sure we could run the remaining laps and get the most points available to us
6866154 i lost an opportunity for some very valuable points today i got a bit aggressive and was trying to get some heat in the tires and just spun i feel worse for briscoe and his guys after he had nowhere to go and got into the back of me tough day for the target team today
6866155 going up the hill i think there was a slower car and everyone behind them had to scatter i got hit on the right side after making a move to avoid the slower car but someone got into me and broke our right rear suspension i took a ride through the grass and after that the target team did the best they could to get us back on track for points

6866157 what has happened here in iowa is an absolute tragedy and my heart goes out to all the victims of the horrific tornados and floods
6866158 when you see the devastation there you cant help but feel for all those victims
6866159 we as athletes are lucky enough to be in a position to do things like this and i encourage others to do the same
6866160 the marriage of the nintendo wii and guitar hero makes a lot of sense for the target guest the music of aerosmith bridges generations just as the wii has done everyone in the family can share that experience with this bundle
6866161 were very excited to have guitar hero bring together two great american traditions rock n roll aerosmith style and nascar racing fans at the event will get a double treat watching their favorite drivers race and competing for a chance to face off against one of them on
6866162 historically chip ganassi racing has partnered with many iconic brands once again teaming with target and now with activisions guitar hero franchise only adds to the list but then coupling that with rock legends aerosmith is icing on the cake i think we would be hard pressed to find a promotion that is this much fun and with as much fan appeal inside the garage as it does outside
6866163 i love video games and actually have versions of guitar hero that i play on my bus and at home to have target activision and aerosmith on my car for the new hampshire race is pretty cool who doesnt love aerosmiths music its perfect for getting ready for the side by side non stop action of nascar racing
6866164 five fresh hot dumplings per order in a variety of flavors for a mere 3 50 did i mention these dumplings are huge
6866165 what a great day for target chip ganassi racing and a great birthday present my wife and i drove from chicago to iowa earlier this week and we saw the flooding and it was just heartbreaking scott and i are glad we could help out as best we could this weekend i hope the race today put a smile on the faces of the people of iowa and took their minds off the challenges and most difficult times they are facing
6866166 early on the car was definitely not working the way i wanted it was very loose especially on the low line i started using the high line and it came together better the high line was definitely the choice of the day when you had three or four guys in front on you trying to do the same thing it was difficult to pass i think strategy played out in the end and thats the way it goes its hard work to pass here its good to see dan get a break hes had a tough year so far
6866167 it was a tough night we had a very good car once again it was very tough to pass here even when the tires got old it was very hard to get close to people if we were out front i think we had a car to win kanaan definitely looked pretty strong tonight but i think the target car still had a chance
6866168 i was trying to be aggressive while trying to finish the race and it was difficult behind the other cars we knew there would be more than a few wrecks tonight and that proved to be the case the car shut off on the last lap for some reason and thats not what we need when were trying to close the point gap
6866169 sheamoisture is more than a new line of body and beauty items

6866176 though jas has her mom gone and i have my dad gone we both know what it feels like to have such an important role in your life not being filled
6866177 research shows that children gain a greater understanding of what they have read when they are encouraged to reflect and respond through writing
6866178 with targets continued support of programs like ours that encourage a lifelong love of reading we are confident that more american children will be avid young readers for years to come
6866179 i cant believe it its great for the team and great for target we just want to win this championship im sorry to see it end under caution but its a great way to get some points for this championship dan wheldon did a great job coming from the back and i saw him looming there for a little while i dont know what to say we finally won at texas and im pretty happy about that mike hull and engineers eric bretzman and brian welling did a good job getting me to aim for a fuel number i had to be very close to the end but so was everyone else i think we would have been on the edge but i think we would have been all right if it went green to the end
6866180 very good results for everybody at target chip ganassi racing obviously scott dixon is on a tear right now unfortunately i wasnt able to run the polaroid car but thats the way it goes i want to say thank you to the delphi safety team for the job they did this weekend they were pretty busy it was a little inconsistent for me but thats part of racing we came out with a top five it still didnt go my way but well work on that

6866186 with divine assistance she has redirected these waters and made them into
6866187 many fish are hard to tell apart once theyve been filleted and packaged
6866188 we hope our work lights the way to getting mislabelled and endangered fish species out of grocery store refrigerators and frying pans
6866189 this not only raises concerns of consumer fraud but also public health
6866190 we are not certain where the mislabelling occurs but it seems it is not the fishermen since the mislabelled fish are from completely different parts of the world
6866191 perhaps the mislabelling occurs somewhere in the middle when the fish are filleted and no longer easily identifiable

6866208 i recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country

6866210 i have had no choice but to decrease the total budget
6866211 its extremely difficult because failure breeds failure and contributors are less likely to spend money on a losing cause
6866212 republicans just need to adapt to the conditions in each individual state because if this election is a referendum on the state of the country then theyre going to do very badly
6866213 with new secretive republican front groups appearing every day to attack democratic candidates there is no shortage of money on their side but all we can do is work hard to match our goals and we are on course to do that

6866228 maybe todays evangelicals are more concerned about being accepted by the gop establishment than they are supporting principled conservative candidates after all pauls willingness to openly oppose his own party has caused him to be blacklisted by party loyalists and apologists therefore it might be that our illustrious evangelical leaders are unwilling to be identified with paul lest they share the same ostracism

6866283 liberals feel unworthy of their possessions conservatives feel they deserve everything theyve stolen
6866284 wisconsin department of transportation officials are studying the feasibility of tearing down the daniel hoan memorial bridge rebuilding most of the interstate 794 connection at street level and building smaller lift bridges over the milwaukee and kinnickinnic rivers to connect the lake parkway to downtown were looking at the feasibility of tearing the hoan bridge down because the cost of rehabilitation is astronomical
6866285 the marriage of the nintendo wii and guitar hero makes a lot of sense for the target guest the music of aerosmith bridges generations just as the wii has done everyone in the family can share that experience with this bundle
6866286 were very excited to have guitar hero bring together two great american traditions rock n roll aerosmith style and nascar racing fans at the event will get a double treat watching their favorite drivers race and competing for a chance to face off against one of them on guitar hero aerosmith
6866287 historically chip ganassi racing has partnered with many iconic brands once again teaming with target and now with activisions guitar hero franchise only adds to the list but then coupling that with rock legends aerosmith is icing on the cake i think we would be hard pressed to find a promotion that is this much fun and with as much fan appeal inside the garage as it does outside
6866288 i love video games and actually have versions of guitar hero that i play on my bus and at home to have target activision and aerosmith on my car for the new hampshire race is pretty cool who doesnt love aerosmiths music its perfect for getting ready for the side by side non stop action of nascar racing
6866289 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6866290 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6866291 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6866292 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6866293 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6866294 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6866295 we are excited to bring these two programs to mercy college
6866296 lacrosse continues to grow in our region new york northeast and it will only help add to the profile of our institution we look forward to building them from the ground up and watching each program develop
6866297 not realizing that they were really 16 by passing the buck onto some lower level schlepp because their passports werent correct
6866298 we started doing this because of the significant interest of the fans and media in college football
6866299 it is productive to bring all these people together in one forum to answer various questions
6866300 this is an attempt to set the record straight about why some decisions were made that will have an impact on college football
6866301 athletics is an integral part of ohio state and part of our responsibility is to advance our academics
6866302 our commitment to excellence extends throughout campus and supporting the library is one way our department can help provide ohio state students including our student athletes a truly world class education
6866303 new york i love you but youre bringing me down
6866304 i found the presenter to be sort of insulting he kept making the audience raise their hands to show who used what if they werent what he used then he would make a snide aside even though 90 of my tools were on his good list i felt uncomforted for the rest of everyone he was very opinionated and seemed to see black and white but no gray areas the content was decent which is why he didnt get a 1 from me it has turned me on to a new way of doing my websites
6866305 division ii schools and their athletics departments should work with businesses to create community
6866306 dont think of it as asking businesses to support athletics approaching them to be sponsors may satisfy the institutions need but not the companys rather appeal to the companys sense of needing to make a similar connection to the community
6866307 so many companies are trying to connect at a local level but they dont have the place to do it
6866308 institutions provide the scalable grass roots the place where the community gathers
6866309 companies spend 300 billion on advertising essentially as a way to disseminate information about their products but in todays world of information overload companies are poised to be convinced to spend the advertising budgets differently by
6866310 in effect rich emphasized a nontraditional sports marketing approach by outlining the six ingredients for a successful community engagement event and he challenged division ii schools to recognize that they have the gathering place which they can sell to companies as more of them want to connect with communities
6866311 the division ii platform was created to help institutions tell their stories but businesses need to tell their stories too the college as gathering place approach helps both sides win
6866312 theyve been talking a lot their friends are quite pleased that theyre getting back together and are trying to give them space
6866313 shes inspired me to do so much shes the most discerning person ive ever met shell read a script 100 times shes relentless
6866314 the entire university family mourns her loss and is praying for the repose of her soul and for the consolation of her family and friends
6866315 she was highly thought of by everyone who knew her the cross country team members had nothing but kind words for her it is hard to measure how deep this loss is to all of us
6866316 i dnt no who the fuk u think u dealin wit u will neva be heard from one phone call is all i gotta make no try me sho me
6866317 in vergelijking met acht jaar geleden is er veel veranderd maar dat hebben we als team nauwelijks gemerkt zo geleidelijk is het gegaan dat is ook het leuke van marc hij heeft oog voor alle facetten van de sport natuurlijk begint het met tactiek en techniek maar ook mentaal zijn we de laatste jaren enorm gegroeid hij weet wat een team nodig heeft en hij is zich steeds blijven ontwikkelen
6866318 ik dacht als dat maar goed gaat maar de speelsters bleven rustig en ze hielden geloof in de rust oogden ze nog fit ze zeiden tegen elkaar het komt wel het team nam mij bij de hand dat was een mooi moment
6866319 na n wedstrijd in dit toernooi was al duidelijk dat de finale tussen china en nederland zou gaan
6866320 maar toen hielp keepster lisanne de roever ons er doorheen
6866321 dat we zo fit zijn hebben we ook aan onszelf te danken
6866322 op een trainingskamp in zuid afrika hebben we met elkaar gepraat om duidelijk te krijgen hoe we olympisch kampioen konden worden alleen spelen in de nederlandse competitie was daarvoor niet genoeg niet om internationaal tophockey te spelen in ieder geval toen hebben we besloten de trainingen vanaf maart enorm op te voeren in de laatste fase trainden we negen of tien keer per week dat deed china immers ook
6866323 there would be no fee for the public to use the network
6866324 when talking to coach pettit earlier this year about retiring our next jersey we thought that this player would be an ideal choice
6866325 she had not only been one of the most dominant players at her position in school history but also played on the national team following her college career
6866326 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable
6866327 an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the name of god in daily life emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship
6866328 ask them to try to come up with alternate language

6866469 as we feared the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
6866470 we also call for respect for free expression to become one of the criteria when selecting cities to host the games
6866471 we hail all those in china and abroad who did not stop pressing for more freedom of expression before the olympic games
6866472 we will remain vigilant in case the post olympic period ushers in a new wave of repression

6866501 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6866502 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year

6866505 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected

6866555 i came into the school year with faculty connections and 11 friends and i was already adapted to living at bates
6866556 knowing some of the faculty around campus made the biggest difference
6866557 i knew exactly who to go to if i needed something in particular
6866558 to warn the press of the novels potential to provoke anger among some muslims
6866559 hes just looking for an opportunity and a spot to help a team
6866560 i think there are a few teams waiting on mats sundin to see what he ends up doing
6866561 its preliminary and mark is finding out what his interest is as well
6866562 these lovely unique jeans would be nice added to your collection
6866563 organization dedicated to improving the administration of justice by providing leadership and service to court systems in the united states
6866564 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6866565 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6866566 just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
6866567 why would i ask for it i could be the drunkest man here and i wouldnt ask for it coke makes my teeth itch ive never ever asked for it
6866568 theres a correlation between high oxygen in the neonatal intensive care unit and impaired breathing down the road
6866569 the problem is how do you test that in human research you wouldnt withhold oxygen just to have a control group
6866570 what impresses me most is how relatively brief exposure of a week or two to high oxygen in early life can permanently alter the way an animal behaves
6866571 weve studied rats up until the point where they start dying of old age and their breathing is still altered
6866572 the idea of green ratings certainly gives more visibility to the obvious importance of environmental responsibility on college campuses today and thats a good thing
6866573 however no issue would seem more complicated or less likely to be reducible to a numerical score
6866574 while its nice to be recognized for what we consider a longstanding strength and a widespread commitment at bates no college or university that is serious about environmental responsibility should want to pat itself on the back too quickly for policies and practices that need to be constantly reviewed debated refined updated and paid for
6866575 where else are you going to buy quality scuba or snorkel gear in sf
6866576 skip the holiday fiasco im going to a beach destination
6866577 when the dust settles and the inventory of foreclosed and unsold homes has been absorbed there could be a shortage of new homes to buy
6866578 we are building less than a third of the new housing units needed to keep up with californias growth and that will ultimately drive up prices we have seen an increase in affordability but that will disappear at some point
6866579 if you aint got nothing you aint got nothing to lose
6866580 joe i want to ask you if its fair to call this playing a pow card
6866581 everybody knows john mccain is a patriot ares nothing wrong with having investment properties lots of americans do if i was barack obama i wouldnt get into this argument with john mccain who is an american hero
6866582 with the way things were going in the united states
6866583 see sells only their own brand of glasses so dont expect to see anything by prada or oliver peoples here
6866584 sooo a girl with a large correction eh lets see
6866585 its going to be more wicked than anyone ever imagined
6866586 there are no ray guns but it involves another planet the alien agents theyre more ghost wraith like
6866587 you know when the alien is stuck in the pantry everyone was mad i loved that scene because the alien probably didnt know what a door was
6866588 i loved the fact that he couldnt figure it out
6866589 and grisly the xenos dont carry ray guns after all what ienco depicts in his art is a much more horrific death with victims suffering snarled faces and burning flesh in their final moments
6866590 i did the basic plot then i drew the first 100 pages then i scripted them
6866591 i then went back and finished the final 27 pages then image wanted it in color i couldnt find a colorist for it so i said screw it and i colored it myself
6866592 but lets have some green to go with that dream not that money is everything but im in the door now im ecstatic even if it is just my little toe thats in that door but image has picked up manifestation and images audience is huge they dont pick up just any comic
6866593 i think its as simple as when they buy a story but some of the characters have been optioned by another studio they cant call parker by his real name so he becomes porter or walker instead
6866594 some of the books supporting cast appeared in other wildstorm books before sleeper but the fact that sleeper was set in that universe was largely incidental the four series leads were developed by brubaker and phillips exclusively for sleeper
6866595 so i revised point blank so the secret was about holden carver but sleeper was already being worked on and sean had designed the characters
6866596 tom cruise is not just one of the biggest stars in the world hes also a great actor who tends to pick really interesting and exciting projects to star in
6866597 and look at him in collateral and tell me he couldnt play holden i was actually thinking of him in collateral a bit when i wrote lawless that intensity
6866598 it drove me crazy because the girls just fell over him when he put on those raybans now i win though because tom cruise wants to star in my movie
6866599 cate blanchett would be my pick for miss misery i think because she reminds me in all the right ways of veronica lake
6866600 and shes one of the best actresses in the world and shes never played a part like this
6866601 i have a relationship with the guys in raimis office on this project so im hopeful ill be involved on some level but its not up to me
6866602 i have no illusions itll be me even though i am doing screenwriting now and im pretty sure i wouldnt want to write it
6866603 this is the fifth time i think that ive heard of serious action on sleeper at this point
6866604 that deal didnt work out for a few business reasons but russell and raimis partner josh donen didnt give up
6866605 i even heard that tom cruise called them the other day to push it along because hes so excited about it
6866606 from what i understand theyre just working on the deal at warners with those guys now and its all moving nicely
6866607 all truth passes through three stages first it is ridiculed second it is violently opposed third it is accepted as being self evident
6866608 could you puh leaze give us a few minutes if you dont mind we are still setting up here okay okay thanks thanks

6866655 while crude oil prices this week have been flat or trading slightly upwards on world markets the price of oil is still substantially below the all time high of 147 a barrel reached on july 17th and that decline is still being reflected at the gasoline pump that means consumers have seen prices drop by more than 10 percent in new mexico and nationally as well
6866656 in new mexico the three largest metropolitan areas are seeing gas prices fall steadily however in the more rural areas of the state prices remain noticeably higher than the national and statewide average its economics 101 and the rule of the marketplace because there are more gas stations in the cities they have to be more competitive drivers have more choices in rural areas where there are fewer stations theres less competition and owners can sell gas for a higher price even when prices fall

6866919 die ersten beiden trainingssessions liegen hinter dir was ist dein eindruck von der strecke
6866920 ich mag die strecke sehr alle waren heute berrascht wie schlecht der grip ist aber die bedingungen besserten sich im lauf des tages das wird sicherlich den rest des wochenendes so weitergehen genau wie in monaco
6866921 ich finde sie sehr anspruchsvoll denn sie verlangt wirkliche pr zision von den fahrern ganz besonders bei den bremspunkten
6866922 f hlst du dich mit dem renault r28 schon wohl auf der strecke
6866923 ich bin heute sehr viel gefahren weil mein hauptziel lautete m glichst viele informationen und daten zu sammeln der rest des rennwochenendes h ngt oft sehr stark davon ab was du am freitag lernst wir werden diese daten sehr intensiv auswerten um das setup zu perfektionieren die gute nachricht dabei ist dass ich heute genau wie fernando unser gesamtes technisches programm abgearbeitet habe
6866924 was h ltst du von der strecke der sicherheit und den m glichkeiten zu berholen
6866925 die strecke ist meiner meinung nach gut nat rlich ist es am ersten tag f r alle schwierig die bremspunkte hinzubekommen besonders da man sehr hart bremsen muss man muss die bremspunkte so fr h wie m glich finden und dann gibt es da noch ein paar stellen die sich sehr hnlich sind wenn man in die kurve 12 und in die kurve 17 nach den langen geraden f hrt dann sind sich diese sehr hnlich
6866926 ich dachte aus diesem grund einmal dass ich mich in kurve 17 befinde und ich war in kurve 12 und verpasste den scheitelpunkt und umgekehrt das war im ersten training im zweiten training lernte ich die strecke etwas mehr es ist nicht einfach ziemlich herausfordernd und auch der letzte sektor ist ziemlich sch n zu fahren man muss sich wirklich konzentrieren um dort das maximum zu erzielen wir k nnen nicht sagen dass es ein normaler stra en kurs ist es ist etwas mehr als ein stra en kurs
6866927 welche teile der strecke magst du am meisten und welche teile sind am herausforderndsten
6866928 ich mag den letzten sektor kurven 19 und 20 und die letzte kurve dort bremst man mit etwas querbeschleunigung das ist immer aufregend und man rutscht im sitz und im cockpit etwas dies ist ein gef hl das man an anderen stellen m glicherweise nicht hat
6866929 du bist heute gute zeiten gefahren hast du das gef hl dass ihr dieses jahr weiterhin im feld nach vorn kommt
6866930 absolut wir haben die saison nicht perfekt begonnen in den ersten drei rennen waren wir glaube ich gerade im dritten qualifying teil im zweiten qualifying teil auf platz neun oder zehn in barcelona machten wir dann einen schritt und dann verbesserten wir das auto rennen f r rennen wir befinden uns nun immer im qualifying in den top sechs und im rennen immer in den punkten dies ist etwas das zum beginn der saison f r uns unm glich war mit sicherheit verbessern wir uns wir kommen nach vorn und dieses wochenende werden wir vielleicht einen weiteren schritt nach vorn sehen hoffentlich
6866931 bist du stolz auf diesen zweiten grand prix in spanien
6866932 ob ich stolz darauf bin in spanien rennen zu fahren nat rlich bin ich sehr stolz und dass wir nun ein zweites rennen haben ist etwas das ich vor drei oder vier jahren mit sicherheit nicht erwartet hatte wir d rfen nicht vergessen dass im jahr 2003 als ich begann mit renault rennen zu gewinnen und auf dem podium zu stehen das nationale fernsehen die rennen nicht live bertrug nun im jahre 2008 haben wir bei den testfahrten im winter fans und bei beiden rennen in spanien volle trib nen es hat sich in spanien und bei den leuten in spanien in bezug auf die formel 1 also viel ver ndert da bin ich mitten drin wor ber ich sehr gl cklich bin
6866933 im hinblick auf das morgige qualifying welche kurven und welche stellen der strecke werden deiner meinung nach entscheidend sein wenn es darum geht die entscheidenden paar zehntelsekunden herauszuholen die man ben tigen k nnte um vor den gegnern zu stehen was ist mit den reifen es schien als sei heute der unterschied zwischen dem harten und dem weichen reifen nicht besonders gro gewesen ist das auch das gef hl das du hast wenn es um die leistung auf einer runde geht
6866934 ich denke dass wir abwarten m ssen wie es morgen in bezug auf die reifen aussieht denn es war heute schwierig irgend etwas auszuprobieren denn jedes mal wenn wir auf die strecke gingen gab es mehr haftung als beim versuch zuvor selbst auf alten reifen geht man auf den n chsten versuch und verbessert sich im vergleich zurzeit davor als man neue reifen hatte f r einen stra en kurs ist dies normal und wir werden uns bis zu einem punkt morgen im qualifying verbessern wenn zwischen den beiden reifen nur ein paar zehntelsekunden liegen und ich wei nicht welcher der schnellere sein wird
6866935 was die perfekte runde im qualifying betrifft so ist es sehr schwierig man f hrt im ersten und im zweiten qualifying teil mit wenig benzin dann kommt man in den dritten qualifying teil und hat ein paar kilogramm benzin an bord das ver ndert das auto komplett besonders beim starken bremsen man hat nur zwei m glichkeiten zwei versuche zwei reifen s tze im dritten qualifying teil auf dem ersten versucht man ein gef hl zu bekommen wo man bremsen muss und wie der grip mit welcher benzin menge ist
6866936 auf der zweiten runde versucht man druck zu machen aber es ist gibt immer probleme die perfekte runde hinzubekommen die meisten probleme auf dieser strecke werden aufgrund ihrer charakteristik mit dem bremsen zu tun haben die stabilit t beim bremsen das gef hl mit zuversicht in die kurve auf der bremse gehen zu k nnen wird in bezug auf die rundenzeiten ziemlich gut sein
6866937 es ist noch eine frage des geldes aber wir reden bereits mit einigen piloten

6867387 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u s presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement in addition to a timetable we should only train iraqi security forces if iraqs leaders reconcile their differences and we must insist that iraq invests its 79 billion surplus on rebuilding its own country its time to succeed in iraq and to honor the sacrifice of our servicemen and women by leaving iraq to a sovereign iraqi government
6867388 self fulfilling prophecy 2008 robert merton is credited with this term tauber 1998 he explained the five points involved
6867389 based upon these expectations the teacher acts in a different manner
6867390 the teachers treatment tells each student loud and clear what behavior and what achievement the teacher expects
6867391 if this treatment is consistent it will tend to shape the students behavior and achievement
6867392 with time the students behavior and achievement will conform more and more closely to that expected of him or her
6867393 whatever we expect with confidence becomes our own self fulfilling prophecy

6867398 it is important to realize that some vulnerable or at risk students nevertheless are more resilient than others and seem impervious to the deleterious impact of negative ee

6867408 yes they had a bible which taught things contrary to christianity like the necessity for following the law im yet to hear how it helps you to point to the existence of a body of scriptures teaching contrary to your religion
6867409 if the apostles keenly wrote down all their teachings then they could at least follow sola scriptura other than during the actual process of enscripturation however they didnt do that and more problematic for you
6867410 the question is not whether the scriptures contain all those things which were said or done by christ and the saints or have any connection whatever with religion the question relates only to things necessary to salvation whether they belong to faith or to practice whether all these things are so contained in the scriptures that they can be a total and adequate rule of faith and practice
6867411 the priesthood is not instituted until exodus 28 and after this time every biblical indication is that sacrifices are the exclusive job of the priests
6867412 im sure if youd been living at the time youd be the first to object if every man and his dog was doing the sacrifices
6867413 your idea of what an emergency is is entirely arbitrary
6867414 they could hardly teach it in principle when they were simultaneously promulgating unwritten dogma
6867415 if they were teaching important things without them being written then they were contradicting sola scriptura
6867416 since most apostles were writing nothing they were very clearly teaching without scriptural backing
6867417 you cant teach sola scriptura in principle and then fail to provide the tools to make it work
6867418 no youre not honest because youre not acknowledging that the apostles taught for decades without scriptural backing and you cant teach a sola scripture principle when your disciples have no scriptures to support the teachings
6867419 except that youve forgotten that this wasnt an argument against authorities it was an argument against the claim that you cant define what scripture is and what it means and yet be subject to it
6867420 ill take this as a concession that this favourite one liner has been refuted
6867421 neatly avoiding the actual question of whether it is epistemologically superior
6867422 youve clearly shown an unwillingness to address the real issues
6867423 it is far more objectively defensible that the church is in a unique position to promulgate a correct canon
6867424 than that steve and every man and his dog are
6867425 as soon as i quoted one church father im no longer acting as an individual
6867426 still waiting for an answer for why you need a rule of faith for the church and not merely a rule of faith your unwillingness to answer demonstrates the two faced nature of your position
6867427 what pope benedict is talking about and the formal notion of ecclesiastical unity are not the same thing
6867428 the marks of the church are certain unmistakeable signs or distinctive characteristics which render the church easily recognizable to all and clearly distinguish it from every other religious society especially from those which claim to be christian in doctrine and origin the catholic conception of the mark of unity which must characterize the one church founded by christ is far more exacting not only must the true church be one by an internal and spiritual union but this union must also be external and visible consisting in and growing out of a unity of faith worship and government
6867429 i said that what is catholic is objective whether it is based on what is objective introduces an entirely different argument try to keep up with the actual line of argument
6867430 i dont have to decide if the bible teaches infant baptism because that catholicism teaches it is less subjective
6867431 objectivity is a necessary but not sufficient criterion try to avoid the most obvious logical errors please
6867432 its not entirely subjective since agreement is a scriptural command
6867433 you made the same judgement when you chose not to start from
6867434 exactly revelation trumps supposition which is why an identifiable source of canon trumps making up your own canon
6867435 all of which would have to worship at the one temple to be truly jews while there were differences of opinion there were boundaries
6867436 try and read more carefully what was handed down was workable and true
6867437 if there was a book which was true but they didnt find how to make it work you would not possess it today the only reason you possess books is because the church figured out how to apply it otherwise they would have thrown it out
6867438 i dont have to make such black and white statements about the fathers as to be inspired or not inspired they are witnesses to the catholic tradition
6867439 even someone unsure on an historical basis about the authorship of 1 timothy can say confidently that the catholic church is an organisation existing continuously since the apostles until now there may never have existed a witness for the former fact but the latter fact has thousands of witnesses in history
6867440 if the question is inspiration then the christian position has always been that the link to christ forms the basis for inspiration
6867441 the church is objectively linked to christ therefore it is inspired
6867442 you cant deny this supposition entirely and be left with even the remains of a canon since christ wrote no scripture directly
6867443 without working towards the unity of mind theyd be in danger of becoming formally disunified which would make them false churches
6867444 a protestant cannot interpret contrary to paul the point is
6867445 protestant arguments about the canon are always outcome based to justify their current list we need mark to be inspired as an outcome therefore we will assume that if he knew peter that is sufficient basis for inspiration
6867446 weve yet to be told where the bible mentions rules of faith for the church
6867447 the protestant sola scriptura definition is outcome based thats why nobody thought of it for 1500 years luther needed a way out he needed a particular outcome
6867448 great but true false minus the objectivity is called las vegas
6867449 no you dont want to actually admit enough to get pinned down when it comes right down to it
6867450 which is a side issue the real issue being that you cant be sure if the bits you believe are the reprobational bits leading to orwellian perspicuity
6867451 1 even something garbled is useful if you recognise its limitations a detective can make use of a garbled message 2 even scripture is garbled to some degree by the work of scribes 3 by looking at multiple garbled messages one can construct the original message
6867452 so you claim but ill take that as a concession of the principle being valid that means the epistemological superior position stands even if you disagree about the facts
6867453 just like the agreement of interviewing 1000 people or agreement of the manuscripts is a
6867454 how is fallible authority an improvement over sola scriptura or private judgment
6867455 but catholics believe that the interpretation is part of the testimony we pass down not only the facts but also what it means
6867456 should anyone care to dispute it and bring some further facts to the table
6867457 you are the one claiming he needs to be a convert for your interpretation to fly you need the verse to mean something that it doesnt on its face mean
6867458 why should i answer a hypothetical the ethiopian was sent on his way in the knowledge that scripture was not enough
6867459 are you going to ignore your pastor because he doesnt quite measure up to your standard of measures
6867460 the analogy is so obvious as to need no defence god set up an authority structure for his ot people and for his nt people the freedoms individuals would have to disregard the ot authorities is very relevant for here and now if you want to claim it is all different the onus is on you to claim something changed
6867461 there is no expiration for the church apart from the 2nd coming
6867462 i wouldnt fault a protestant interpretation if it was almost certainly true the problem is protestant interpretations which are highly debatable
6867463 no im talking about dogma paul didnt just leave a group of people with discipline but no beliefs
6867464 so individuals are not affected by the power trip of infallibility
6867465 youre assuming that the correct interpretation cant be part of the oral tradition
6867466 lots of protestants have if you dont want to say it your canon could be not merely wrong but utterly wrong
6867467 you at least accept the catholic nt canon not the ethiopian syriac or marcion canons
6867468 uh we have a magisterium its not just about what individuals want to count as councils or traditions
6867469 as i have a right to when the foundation of your rule of faith is an individuals interpretation of history
6867470 there can be no end to the questions when that is the sand on which you built your house
6867471 no i dont again this is like saying you need paul to validate everything you say about genesis
6867472 im addressing whatever supposed counterevidence is raised here the historical continuity of the catholic church from the apostles is well known i think the onus is on you to raise something specific as an objection
6867473 your response was to point to the inspiration of paul as equivilent to genesis then i pointed out that is the point of dispute that the magisterium is inspired or in other words your defense was to assume what you want to prove
6867474 since scripture never touches on the subject that would be a neat trick for sola scriptura
6867475 one obscure document could refute your supposition to refute catholic claims need a rewrite of history a much tougher and more unlikely standard
6867476 lets hear the protestant ot canon argument that never mentions what the jews say
6867477 i know youve quoted jews speaking of their traditions so consider yourself refuted
6867478 if i asked you to prove the ot canon youd start talking about what such and such a jew had to say thats an appeal to tradition thats an appeal that assumes a recognisable body of jews existed who held a unified tradition and that the person quoted was a member of said group in short youd be forced to fall back to a tradition based canon
6867479 its not unknown to them they know that the apostles founded the church of rome just like historians do
6867480 its only a problem when conversing with someone who wants to deny the sky is blue and other obvious facts
6867481 what he might or might not do is beside the point
6867482 i notice you didnt object that the 5c church was the church founded by the apostles

6867489 as an educated american with multiple advanced degrees i am deeply saddened that being a pointy headed professor type is considered a negative character trait in this country not only does it offend me personally but more importantly it is precisely this sort of anti intellectual prejudice that is impeding americas ability to compete on the global marketplace where the ability to handle complex intellectual tasks involving information and technology is growing ever more important

6867493 since vitamin d is produced in the skin through solar or uv irradiation and high serum levels have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of ms this suggests that vitamin d may regulate the immune response and may promote a hosts reaction to a pathogen

6867495 one device of vitamin d action may be to preserve balance in the t cell reaction and thus avoid autoimmunity

6867505 one of the problems for us all is that we are not and cannot often be aware of whats going on that the camera hasnt focused on
6867506 when i was told today about the main fundamental ground on which these courses in which youre all taking part are based media and global change i immediately remembered the latin slogan that flew on the flag above shakespeares globe theater totus mundus agit histrionem all the world moves the actor is actually what i think is the direct translation as opposed to all the worlds a stage all the world moves the actor by which can be considered not only the professional actor but the individual the individuals who find themselves in the world
6867507 we certainly have the capacity to be independent thinkers and of course we can be more independent as thinkers and as human beings if we are capable of examining our most fervently held beliefs and seeing them in this changing world

6867509 we want to give students involved in this project an opportunity to gain experience integrating new technology into their studies
6867510 we want to know if the devices can make a difference
6867511 this pilot test is a wonderful opportunity for us to see how equipping students with advanced mobile devices will improve their educational experience
6867512 students are increasingly tech savvy mobile technology is advancing rapidly and a world class research university should be prepared to exploit the educational possibilities
6867513 if the technology will help make a large university smaller and more accessible thats important if it can enhance learning then we need to find out
6867514 weve done extensive planning so that the technology we give our students will help enrich their college experience
6867515 the technology has a great many possibilities and were much more likely to discover them if we go about this in a systematic way

6867524 the latest assessment pegs the number of terrorist training camps still operating across the border at about 40
6867525 one cannot be complacent as the terrorism network and infrastructure across the border remains intact and continues to function as before the terrorist camps have now been cleverly hidden and are being run covertly
6867526 despite continued infiltration attempts almost 150 since january by terrorist groups from across we have been able to foil most of these bids this summer this has caused a serious dent in the capability and motivation of terrorist outfits to initiate violence in j amp k

6867607 this trend of a declining wpi continued up to november 24 2007

6867619 international prices of steel have come done domestic steel producers will have to definitely cut prices because much depends on international prices of steel any reduction in international prices will mean domestic prices will also have to be cut

6867630 they wont let us in but we have a group that will cross in another spot
6867631 theyll have to strip search everyone who crosses that border or they wont know who we are theyll have to see the wbc westboro baptist church tattoo on our butts

6867731 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals

6867756 since vitamin d is produced in the skin through solar or uv irradiation and high serum levels have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of ms this suggests that vitamin d may regulate the immune response and may promote a hosts reaction to a pathogen
6867757 evidence has shown that the maintenance of an adequate vitamin d level may have a protective effect in individuals predisposed to ms
6867758 one device of vitamin d action may be to preserve balance in the t cell reaction and thus avoid autoimmunity
6867759 the fact that uva investigators brought home four of 17 awards from a total of more than 100 applications and from researchers in 12 countries around the world speaks to our strength in this field

6867769 all of us i believe carry a memory of eden life began in that garden and for me many of the good things of life are still to be found in gardens i would even say that much as i love a manor house i am best pleased by the extensive gardens that wreathe these stately homes in natural splendor when i came upon the blooming spring gate i accepted its invitation to explore partly to satisfy a secret longing for the splendid gardens i expected to discover within and since this is a locale of the imagination i havent been disappointed the gardens beyond spring gate are as sumptuous and satisfying as i can make them the third print in my spring gate series illustrates my belief that gardens truly are the loveliest imaginable setting for a civilized life the manor house as grand and imposing as it is serves as a gateway to this marvelous garden imagine taking tea at the gem bright reflecting pool while the perfume of blossoms washes over you and the rustling breeze in the dogwood trees mingles with the tinkle of falling water in the fountain now that is my idea of a visit to eden by the way as a tribute to my recently celebrated 40th birthday ive hidden 40 ns within this painting perhaps you can enjoy a cup of tea in this imaginary garden as you search for them

6868004 john mccain has so many houses that he cant remember how many he owns

6868102 we all have the same egyptian blood and if the purpose of the measure is to prohibit the traffic of organs we reject it because that could occur as well among the faithful of the same religion
6868103 we fear that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims
6868104 to protect poor muslim from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
6868105 to prevent any attempt to deceive the infirm and rob them of their organs especially if this occurs between christians and muslims because in this case it does open the door to a crisis between both communities
6868106 discriminatory since it violates human rights the constitution and national unity
6868107 if the union does not annul the decision there will be more conflicts between christians and muslims
6868108 in its first major post vatican ii confrontation with the sexual revolution the most potent manifestation of the notion of freedom as personal autonomy the church had been put squarely on the defensive

6868110 i was dismayed by the prohibition of the old missal since nothing of the sort had ever happened in the entire history of the liturgy
6868111 the old building was demolished and another built to be sure largely using materials from the previous one and even using the old building plans there is no doubt that this new missal in many respects brought with it a real improvement and enrichment but setting it as a new construction over against what had grown historically forbidding the results of this historical growth thereby makes the liturgy appear to be no longer a living development but the product of erudite work and juridical authority this has caused us enormous harm
6868112 i am convinced that the crisis in the church that we are experiencing today is to a large extent due to the disintegration of the liturgy when at times has even come to be conceived of etsi deus non daretur in that it is a matter of indifference whether or not god exists and whether or not he speaks to us and hears us

6868114 love for the word of god and the sanctification of sunday are now the particular testimony of bishop egger which will help the faithful and parish communities to make the encounter with the god of love the center of their lives
6868115 profound relationship with the sacred scriptures which molded his entire life and from which he learned thus the celebration of the eucharist constituted the central moment of his spiritual life and therefore he celebrated sunday mass in a profoundly pastoral way with the faithful of his diocese
6868116 aptly expresses the life of this man of the church as a christian a religious and a bishop his example is an invitation to each one of us to open ourselves to the love of god and enliven it with consistent effort in order to bring out in our own lives the authentic following of love

6868194 if the municipal official is acquitted or found not guilty or is otherwise cleared of the charges which were the basis of the arrest indictment or information by reason of which he or she was suspended under the provisions of this section then the governor shall forthwith revoke the suspension and restore such municipal official to office and the official shall be entitled and be paid full back pay and such other emoluments or allowances to which he or she would have been entitled for the full period of time of the suspension
6868195 it appears therefore that based on the explicit wording of the above cited statute the appropriate procedure is for mr rosado to first request that the governor enter an executive order revoking the suspension if the governor revokes the suspension then the statute mandates payment of back pay and benefits

6868269 i am often asked if the olympic village the vast restaurant and housing conglomeration that hosts the worlds top athletes for the duration of the games is the sex fest it is cracked up to be my answer is always the same too right it is i played my first games in barcelona in 1992 and got laid more often in those two and a half weeks than in the rest of my life up to that point that is to say twice which may not sound a lot but for a 21 year old undergraduate with crooked teeth it was a minor miracle barcelona was for many of us olympic virgins as much about sex as it was about sport there were the gorgeous hostesses there to assist the athletes in their bright yellow shirts and black skirts there were the indigenous lovelies who came to watch the competitions and then there were the female athletes literally thousands of them strutting shimmying sashaying and jogging around the village clad in lycra and exposing yard upon yard of shiny toned rippling and unimaginably exotic flesh women from all the countries of the world muscular virile athletic and oozing oestrogen i spent so much time in a state of lust that i could have passed out

6868280 on the portico of the mccain estate in sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses
6868281 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
6868282 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6868283 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6868284 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four

6868322 zanu pf is likely to back a candidate from mutambaras faction
6868323 zanu pf were initially prepared to back ncube but he said no
6868324 tsvangirais faction had however rejected the proposal of ncube as speaker preferring gibson sibanda
6868325 zanu pf is aware that a combined opposition vote will result in an mdc tsvangirai speaker and in a bid to divide the opposition they are backing nyathis candidacy so as to frustrate the mdc tsvangirai
6868326 the partys national council met on wednesday and endorsed paul themba nyathi as our speaker of parliament candidate and we believe as a smaller party in parliament we can provide a neutral speaker not from zanu pf or the mdc tsvangirai faction who will lead constructive debates

6868331 we also found no evidence that use of a statin was associated with risk of developing more aggressive subtypes of prostate caner
6868332 overall we found no support for the current hypothesis that statin use may reduce risk of prostate cancer
6868333 current use of a statin was associated with a 50 percent increase in risk of prostate cancer and use for 5 or more years was associated with an 80 percent increase in risk of the disease both of these risk estimates were statistically significant

6868435 en el f tbol si no obtienes el resultado a la gente el equipo y al entrenador se les va a exigir

6868437 en brasil hay mucha presi n en relaci n con el oro hay que vencer siempre pero en el f tbol hay otros equipos como la propia argentina que siempre est muy fuerte y busca los resultados desgraciadamente quedamos fuera de la final pero conseguimos un bronce que para nosotros es importante
6868438 es importante porque son 15 000 los atletas que participan en la olimp ada y todos buscaron una medalla

6868458 this shuttle service starts the 21st of august and its available for all departing and arriving passengers a direct non stop shuttle service will connect houston metropolitan area and abia south terminal
6868459 with this service we would link the city of houston with our low cost flights air fares have sky rocketed on international flights to mexico between the big connecting hubs like houston or dallas
6868460 weve discovered that many viva passengers drive from houston to take advantage of our low fares from austin and have decided to offer them this service that starts from omnibus express bus terminal in the houston metropolitan area we are able to offer great parking space in houston and its free for a period of ten days the shuttle service is available for purchase on our website onboard your viva flight at the south terminal and in the bus terminal at houston
6868461 this shuttle service is part of our low cost strategy which is to offer the lowest prices on air travel to the vast majority of the population the price we are charging for a 150 mile shuttle service is cheaper than a cab ride to downtown

6868463 valencia es uno de los circuitos m s duros f sicamente del mundo
6868464 entre los cuatro o cinco m s duros f sicamente del mundo
6868465 el circuito es bastante duro est entre los cuatro o cinco circuitos m s duros del mundial hay tres o cuatro grandes frenadas en las que pasas de s ptima velocidad a 300 y pico por hora a primera que obligan a aguantarlas un poco con el cuerpo la verdad es que cuando llegas a boxes con la humedad y el calor aparte del l quido que pierdes es duro f sicamente
6868466 es m s lento de lo que parec a caminando
6868467 hay tres o cuatro curvas de primera velocidad que pens bamos que iban a ser en segunda sobre todo estaba muy sucio
6868468 esta ma ana hab a como polvo como tierra en el circuito y a medida que ha ido avanzando el d a hemos ido teniendo m s agarre y yo creo que ahora con la gp2 y las dem s categor as que van a rodar la pista estar ma ana en mejores condiciones y podremos divertirnos un poco m s hoy ha sido un poco patinaje
6868469 m s que nada porque el primero y el segundo son largas rectas y frenadas para curvas lentitas el ltimo sector es la nica parte donde combina algunas curvas a derecha izquierda entrelazadas m s o menos a tope y es donde m s te diviertes
6868470 se llega desde la recta m s larga en la que se alcanzan los 312 o 313 km h y la curva creo que se da a 57 por hora es una frenada brutal
6868471 bastante sucio cuando te sales de la l nea de carrera por lo que adelantar ser una maniobra arriesgada
6868472 tenemos que analizar los datos en hungr a donde tampoco se puede adelantar hicimos una estrategia pensando en la carrera bamos muy largos parando el ltimo y sali bien ya que finalizamos cuartos o sea que hay que intentar clasificar bien pero pensando tambi n en carrera
6868473 salimos con poca carga aerodin mica y vimos que era demasiado poca porque el coche era completamente inconducible tuvimos que poner un poquito m s de aler n y seguimos siendo bastante r pidos en la recta
6868474 para ma ana habr que pensar si dejamos este tipo de carga aerodin mica o si ponemos m s y yo creo que con la mejora que va a haber en la pista ma ana ser m s f cil conducir para todo el mundo
6868475 el puente no se nota nada cuando vas en el coche yo creo que a la velocidad que lo pasas es imposible notar cualquier variaci n
6868476 cuando se juega contra brasil ya se sabe que siempre es un partido dif cil porque tienen mucha calidad individual pero en realidad hoy han tenido suerte dos veces de que el bal n entrara nosotros no hemos tenido la misma suerte y eso es lo que ha marcado la diferencia esta noche
6868477 brasil era mejor que nosotros pero eso no quiere decir que no pudieran haber perdido el partido hoy
6868478 creo que podemos estar orgullosos de nuestro partido de hoy y sobre todo del torneo que hemos hecho
6868479 vinimos aqu por una medalla y estamos decepcionados de ser cuartos pero creo que argentina nigeria y brasil en total han estado un poquito mejor que nosotros
6868480 en realidad el segundo gol justo antes del descanso acab con nosotros
6868481 tuvimos ocasiones para marcar el 1 1 y era otro partido aunque en el segundo tiempo tratamos de seguir d ndolo todo
6868482 el otro partido fue el primero as que los dos equipos no ten an a n el ritmo que han ense ado hoy
6868483 formar un bloque en defensa en intentar salir con peligro
6868484 uno sabe que las ocasiones que tengas las tienes que marcar porque si no es imposible ganar a brasil lo hemos intentado mucho pero la pelota no entr y con brasil es dif cil
6868485 hoy jugamos mal s lo que no marcamos y eso era lo principal que hab a que hacer
6868486 somos el mejor equipo de europa y el cuarto mejor del mundo
6868487 el f tbol belga est atravesando un momento dif cil
6868488 y creo que hemos demostrado que hay esperanza para el futuro que tenemos muchos buenos jugadores y si formamos bien un grupo podemos hacer cosas importantes ya que hay mucho talento en este equipo hay un futuro para b lgica
6868489 vinimos con la ambici n de jugar los cuartos de final
6868490 justificamos nuestra posici n con una buena actuaci n independientemente del resultado en los cuatro ltimos partidos
6868491 tal vez se puede decir que uno de los mejores jugadores de brasil fue el portero renan ya que tuvimos un mont n de oportunidades para marcar pero l tambi n hizo un gran partido hoy

6868500 el mal uso del dinero p blico haciendo otro circuito cuando en la provincia de valencia ya hay uno en cheste y cuando la ciudad tiene muchas otras necesidades como un colegio p blico en nazaret o un centro de salud en el grao
6868501 es exagerado el impacto ac stico al que se nos somete en contra de nuestra voluntad

6868507 well we do call ourselves pigtones as in politically incorrect gps do we expect heat sure but if we can help someone get over any road rage by adding a few laughs to their trip itll all be worth it besides we are an equal opportunity offender we even have a contest that lets the driving public decide who we parody next

6868559 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6868560 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6868561 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6868562 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties

6868620 keep your eye on that building itll be coming down soon
6868621 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6868622 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6868623 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6868624 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6868625 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6868626 nist said that wtc 7 fell at 40 slower than free fall speed but it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant 40 slower isnt very impressive thats like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal
6868627 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6868628 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6868629 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6868630 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds
6868631 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6868632 the court held that the manner in which pcaob board members are appointed and overseen under the sarbanes oxley act is constitutional
6868633 russians have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6868634 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6868635 exactly the main question is where there is nothing left anymore
6868636 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here

6868647 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6868648 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6868649 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6868650 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat

6868654 i said i would love to have an individual medal and i got it bronze is good
6868655 during march 2008 and again in june early july negative developments in the u s were unambiguously dollar negative
6868656 however as decoupling theories made way for recoupling theories and the rest of world started showing signs of strain following the u s fall out the impact of adverse u s developments on the dollar is now less certain
6868657 short term association aside dollar movements are not a contributory factor to determining commodity price movements and year to date prices have gone up or down across most commodities by roughly similar magnitudes in all currencies
6868658 there is no consistent inverse correlation between the two contrary to what is often assumed by many market participants
6868659 better clarity on growth momentum may only be obtained in late 2008 when the temporary ups and downs associated with the olympics have worked through the monthly data
6868660 was more to do with a correction following the recent sharp commodities sell off
6868661 that data was held in a secure site by an external contractor was downloaded at that external contractors onto a memory stick and that memory stick has been mislaid
6868662 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
6868663 it runs against the rules set down for both holding government data and set down by the external contractor
6868664 this is part of a systemic failure by the government to keep data safe
6868665 this will destroy any grain of confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security

6868672 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6868673 when negotiations are hopefully coming to an end when you can see the end in sight there are a lot of details that have to be worked out and i think were in the process of working out details right now

6868690 we registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
6868691 the number of peacekeepers in abkhazia will be 2 142 personnel and the number of peacekeepers in south ossetia will be fixed at a later date

6868699 the first thing ill say about the logitech dinovo edge bluetooth keyboard is that its very likely the most aesthetically stunning keyboard thats ever been made for mac computers with its high gloss piano black semi translucent plexiglass finish accented by a brushed aluminum palm rest all imparting an aura of posh elegance it looks even better first hand than it does in pictures and its mighty impressive in pictures
6868700 imho the dinovo edge makes the apple bluetooth keyboard look like a wallflower to its belle of the ball the aluminum unit a bit stark and kind of gimmicky with its anorexic thinness by comparison the logitech board is slim as well but still with enough meat in its section to have just about the right amount of key travel and conventional slightly contoured keys

6868706 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6868707 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines

6868735 from the moment last thursday when donnette was struck down scores of new yorkers pulled together as one to try to save her and her still unborn child

6868737 by maintaining harvest levels rather than adopting a temporary moratorium on all horseshoe crab take the commission has dangerously underestimated the needs of both the crab and the red knot

6868739 there is a fundamental change required at the asmfc management board their inadequate and blinkered mandate needs to be widened to include all marine resources affected by their actions not just limited commercial interests

6868756 russia is not in compliance and russia needs to come into compliance now
6868757 but we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6868758 compliance means compliance with that plan we havent seen that yet

6868775 for people struggling with this disease or those who will be diagnosed scientific breakthroughs can be a matter of life or death literally we want everyone to know that they can make a difference in this fight
6868776 television is a notoriously competitive business for the three major broadcast networks to join forces is a wonderful example of the power of working together and were very grateful to have the opportunity to reach people all over the country through this show
6868777 as a motion picture and television producer ive learned how incredibly powerful these mediums can be in generating public discourse sometimes almost overnight our goal with this initiative and tv show is to tip the conversation in this country about cancer to get people riled up so they want to do something about the fact that it still takes so many lives

6868781 fijis people need to realise that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6868782 each one of the us as the citizens of this country must now ask are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6868783 if we succumb to such pressures what next what will that do to our self worth as an independent nation
6868784 you all are aware of the high level public posturing by the leaders of the two countries both days before the forum meeting and after they learnt that fiji will not be in the niue meeting
6868785 the pacific island countries will need to be vigilant to protect the forum organisation becoming a foreign policy tool of these two countries
6868786 they now seem to have usurped the moral leadership of the region
6868787 against this background and the situation which fiji is in now fijis people need to realise that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6868788 we dont expect the situation to deteriorate but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
6868789 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
6868790 we would work with what ever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence if that was not possible then in the last instance the lives and the well being of our citizens would be paramount and we would do it with or without that concurrence

6868805 we have seen lots of people taking their dogs for a walk since the establishment of the designated area and we have been inundated by phone calls from happy pet owners thanking and congratulating us for this initiative

6868814 we started getting phone calls from people around the nation asking how to do it
6868815 i think there is large number of software developers out there who would want to do something more meaningful with their time
6868816 with this we tried to hone in on a specific issue one that i had a background in and one that is imminently mappable you are talking about physical resources that exist
6868817 it does seem obvious but the non profit realm tends to be five years behind the technology curve
6868818 i think it speaks to tack of technology adoption by non profits they are really risk adverse they dont have a lot of money to throw around and make mistakes with

6869046 he allah has ordained for you the same religion islam which he ordained for noah and that which we have inspired in you o mohammad and that which we ordained for ibrahim moses and jesus saying you should establish religion by implementing the commandments and make no divisions in it
6869047 and indeed we have sent messengers before you o mohammad of them some we have related to you their story and some we have not related to you their story

6869055 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011 mr hammoud said
6869056 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6869057 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6869058 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6869059 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6869060 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6869061 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement

6869063 estamos conversando cuando r pido oliveira manda la mano a la backpack mochila saca su rev lver y pienso en decirle junior guarda eso

6869065 le suplico que no me dispare y pone su revolver aqu
6869066 cuando me dispara por segunda vez sent una explosi n horrible siento que muero

6869076 just putting those school clothes back on and getting back into the ring can be an adjustment for some kids
6869077 especially if theyre changing schools or moving from a lower to an upper or middle to an upper school there can be a period of adjustment
6869078 my sons an introvert but if you ask him something hell tell you so kids will talk to you if you ask the right way dont assume that just because theyre not saying anything everything is alright ask because you need to know whats going on
6869079 the anti vaccination movement is based on irrational fears and is absolutely destructive
6869080 vaccines are mainly for the sake of the herd but no one cares about the community however if you want to protect the entire population you have to vaccinate
6869081 i cant say that every kid who doesnt get vaccinated will get the measles
6869082 it really depends on where you live but vaccines are pretty well regulated and drug makers arent making a lot of money on them contrary to popular belief getting vaccinated is basically for the public good
6869083 parents need to know that the internet can be disinhibiting to young people and adults alike
6869084 and people do things on the internet they wouldnt do in daily life they offer information they wouldnt normally offer in an interpersonal interaction thats more human
6869085 you literally need to warn them that what they do on the internet is real
6869086 ive had teenage patients who have sent naked photos or partially naked photos to boyfriends and if those things get passed around it can carry a terrible stigma and lead to bullying both in and out of school parents need to warn youths that if they do something thats inappropriate it places them at risk
6869087 bullying is bullying whether its done on the internet or in person and it has significant emotional ramifications
6869088 so children need to know that they can come to their parents anytime anyone makes them feel unsafe
6869089 when somebody is bullied it often means that they have sensitivities that someone else believes are valuable
6869090 the first step is defining the problem assessing what is happening and going quickly to the students teacher and let them know whats happening
6869091 parents need to be the first line of defense and take bullying very seriously if they have a relationship with the other childs parents they may want to reach out in a confidential way
6869092 sexual behavior between teens and adolescents is more common that most of us appreciated in the past
6869093 so its important for parents to share with their child that self respect involves your body too and there are risks to sexual contact
6869094 you have to give them a twofold message that the risk of pregnancy exists and theres also the tremendous risk of stds including hiv and this is important because hiv education is one of those things that has receded yet its just as important as ever
6869095 we have very large percentages of kids using drugs or alcohol and that should be something that every parent is talking to every child about
6869096 these are pervasive in most towns and cities in america and kids need to know that youre relying on them to not break the law at all when it comes to the use of illicit drugs and yet its so commonplace that young people try these things you also have to let them know that there will never be a time when youre not willing to listen when they need to talk
6869097 what we want is for kids to experience all the varied emotions that go with maturing and feeling competent and to be able to navigate the choppy waters that go with that
6869098 and alcohol and drugs dont make that any easier also we know that violent crime and many indiscretions take place in the presence of alcohol and drugs
6869099 there was an interesting study done in japan over a 25 year period during the 1960s to the 1980s it was done at a time when the flu and other vaccines were mandatory and what they found was that during that period the mortality rate due to the flu was down a million and the rate of respiratory illness were down over 200 000 so that shows you how important vaccines are
6869100 getting kids to wash their hands more can be done but its difficult
6869101 it would require a complete mindset change so for now the best we can do is let schools handle it the way they do and do our best to isolate sick kids
6869102 its an enormous problem because our schools are serving crap
6869103 how about we put calorie labels on cafeteria food like we do at baskin robbins
6869104 so you know you would never get a single payer health system with republicans in charge right
6869105 i mean you know that republicans hate the idea of what they mock as socialized medicine
6869106 well maybe but i could never vote for obama never
6869107 if you are a good trader why do you need me to fund your effort that does not make sense but it tells me you make more money selling than you do trading
6869108 we received information that was concerning enough for us to ask the federation to look at this more
6869109 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the international gymnastics federation and ioc
6869110 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6869111 were received some information which puts the matter to rest
6869112 if the gymnasts hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated in the games
6869113 we received information that was concerning enough for us to ask the federation to look at this more
6869114 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the international gymnastics federation and ioc
6869115 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6869116 were received some information which puts the matter to rest
6869117 if the gymnasts hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated in the games
6869118 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6869119 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6869120 cybersquatting according to the united states federal law known as the anticybersquatting consumer protection act is registering trafficking in or using a domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else the cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price
6869121 ich habe sehr viel recherchiert habe dokumentationen angeschaut und im internet geforscht
6869122 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybody s dumping commodities again
6869123 obviously yesterday s rally was overcooked and we re simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6869124 it s still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6869125 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6869126 unlike credit card fraud where you can go back and seize that toaster or lcd television they bought how do you go back in there and get somebodys heart
6869127 this is the first time in my 12 years ive seen anything like this
6869128 you cant just walk in with somebodys medicaid card like its a credit card and have heart surgery done
6869129 a doctor would need to know blood type cardiac history medical history and other comprehensive records that just couldnt be faked this doesnt make sense
6869130 when this was brought to our attention by police we immediately launched a review
6869131 this gentleman apparently took pretty significant steps to steal this mans identity were taking all the precautions we can
6869132 he had a hard time and had been very sick
6869133 i think people do what they have to do sometimes
6869134 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6869135 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6869136 if theres nothing around no traffic it doesnt faze me
6869137 its a victimless crime when youre riding a long distance stopping and starting all the time just adds to your fatigue
6869138 were going to be enforcing the same traffic laws for bikes as well as motorists so that both respect each other and the rules of the road as far as bike safety and motor safety
6869139 but were not out here to punish people were out here to change habits
6869140 most people we talk to say that rolling through a stop sign or a light is not that important compared to other things going on
6869141 follow 90 percent of the rules and for the 10 percent youre breaking know that youre breaking them and look at what the safety issue is
6869142 if the goal is to have fewer people going to the hospital or the morgue because of transportation collisions the biggest win is cracking down on bad motorist behavior not bad cyclist behavior
6869143 there is still a big consumer concern about irradiated products and i think that is the single biggest issue
6869144 the scientific community looks at it safety wise as that theres nothing wrong with it at all
6869145 its going to be a business decision as to whether producers use it or not
6869146 it is a safe process you are not going to glow in the dark
6869147 to get people to focus on what a pasteurization process does rather than how it does it
6869148 we really think the manufacturers just want to hide the process from the public
6869149 it hasnt been a commercial success in the beef industry and i dont expect that it will be anymore so here
6869150 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6869151 aber genau so ist es doch bei unserer seite je mehr nutzer drauf sind desto mehr guten content wird es dann auch geben damit bringt es doch jedem nutzer etwas wenn er andere auch dazuholt wieso funktioniert meine plattform nicht viral
6869152 der freund ist auch bei facebook super dann kann ich ihn gleich in meine neue gruppe einladen
6869153 this type of harassment has been used against peaceful protestors in the past and never have these tyrannical methods been acceptable
6869154 the pro life community needs to stand up and demand media attention for these heinous abuses
6869155 american life league is committed to making sure these people get the attention they deserve
6869156 this kind of blatant disregard for pro lifers rights on the part of governor martin omalleys state police wont be tolerated if these pro lifers were pro abortion activists or peta protesters this would have been on the front page of every newspaper on the east coast
6869157 as more information surfaces about this mass arrest all will ensure that everyone in the pro life movement hears about these heroes
6869158 politics is like a soap opera you can be away for six months come back and you havent missed much
6869159 i was just disappointed in whoever had done this to him hes a special person and it was hurtful to him and our family
6869160 youve helped a lot of people and thats why everybody wants to help you
6869161 it was very rewarding to go around and see people just writing checks and handing out money it was just a great outpour of support for eric
6869162 the venues mission is to revive the symbiotic relationship between art and revelry
6869163 still even in that de prioritized state its going to be faster than a typical dsl connection
6869164 the chief impression that a study of the atonement leaves with us is that of the many sidedness of christs work for men when he died for us on the cross he did something so infinitely wonderful that it is impossible to comprehend it in its fullness however mans need be understood that need is fully and abundantly met in christ the new testament writers are like men who ransack their vocabulary to find words which will bring out some small fraction of the mighty thing that god has done for us and yet though it is so complex and so difficult it may be put very simply the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me gal 2 20

6869170 were it not for the duke lacrosse case she likely would be described as a bright young woman from durham north carolina who has had a difficult life
6869171 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6869172 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6869173 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6869174 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege
6869175 jiggering the commission it charges sellers when they close a sale most product categories like computers and electronics will see the fee go down however items like books and dvds will see an increase
6869176 sellers able to maintain of a product will find it easier and cheaper to offer their wares at ebay
6869177 they are favoring sellers that offer a limited range of products
6869178 ebay is so huge i dont understand why it would want to squash smaller sellers that have something unique to offer
6869179 being allowed to create multiple listings for the same fee will probably mean that i should be ok with my best selling lines but i understand that people who sell collectables and things that people are rarely interested in but for which a buyer might come along a few months later might be a bit annoyed at the new fees
6869180 youre faced with a real tough question whats your life
6869181 you face a moment where you think do i come back
6869182 you have to look at it really hard and have the discipline to say i stepped aside for a reason
6869183 your life grooved into that thing you became that job like a quarterback does
6869184 we have had more companies encouraging people to retire early recently but a lot of them simply take the retirement money and go do something else
6869185 we do know that most retired people no matter the reason they retired work at least part time
6869186 there are people with real financial issues and challenges once they retire im not one of them
6869187 if you are lucky enough to tap into a passion and your career happens to match your passion thats great the hard part after retiring is the passion keeps bubbling up
6869188 maybe its a guy thing if the guy has had so much of his identity wrapped up in his profession and hasnt developed other areas of his life to their fuller capacity
6869189 but i would guess that many women now could be experiencing the same kind of thing a transition like this requires a whole reorganization of self and daily life
6869190 the energy required to devote oneself to athletic performance or other pursuits is enormous
6869191 and then when it pays off with recognition that recognition becomes its own high the absence of the adrenaline rush of attention feels more like a depression than a normal state and that can create internal panic
6869192 if youve been at the same job a long time theres a burnout factor your initial reaction is to get away from this totally
6869193 but then you realize i dont want to do nothing you still have youth and all your skills but you dont want to get back in a situation where it has control of you
6869194 i thought i probably could still play but when i retired i was done there were so many things i wanted to do outside baseball
6869195 i had a 2 year old daughter and wanted to watch her grow up
6869196 its working great because you can do it on your own time and turn down assignments
6869197 your friends come out of the woodwork and say could you redo my basement
6869198 but i retired because i wanted to spend more time with my partner mark get my life in order
6869199 for those who believe no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe no explanation is possible
6869200 this cycle mirrors bill clintons democratic convention in 1992 a historic 16 point bump
6869201 barack obama is more similarly situated to bill clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history bill clinton was a new candidate on the national scene he was running in a change oriented election cycle and the economy was voters top issue a dynamic he was able to capitalize on he received a 16 point bump coming out of his convention obama is also a new candidate in a change oriented environment and like bill clinton he will spend the convention presenting himself as the agent of change who will fix the economy
6869202 result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage on thursday obama will give a great speech as has been his trademark the press will sing his praises and remark on his historic address and obamas place in history
6869203 nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6869204 some people will tell you to live life like you have a million dollars in your pocket but i think its a million bucks and a bottle of whiskey sometimes you just dont have time to go to the store
6869205 fair use is a concept under copyright law in the united states that generally speaking permits you to use a copyrighted work in certain ways without obtaining a license from the copyright holder there are similar although generally more limited concepts in other countries copyright laws including a concept known as fair dealing in a number of countries
6869206 faced with taking a legal position adverse to mayor ragsdale my thinking was simply that i did not want my objectivity to be called into question or my ability to act independently as law director to be compromised because of mr gilberts long standing personal and professional relationship with mayor ragsdale
6869207 that i might be disqualified from taking any position adverse to mayor ragsdale once i assume the duties of knox county law director
6869208 hopefully weve picked up another good player that will come in and help the cause

6869212 our last kick in the b town for the summer
6869213 there is no way ventilators are going to keep anyone alive in a pandemic even health care workers will be working in panic mode scared that they may catch the bug and there is a good possibility that mistakes will be made vents need to be attached and adjusted by a respiratory therapist and there arent enough rts to go around a large majority of hcws are not going to want to put themselves at risk as they have to remove tubes and expose themselves to a deadly virus the only option that weve seen is to put them in full bio hazard suits and we just dont have those available on a large scale basis
6869214 you cant tell me if a young quarterback proves himself as the starter this year that his agent wont be working off the ryan contract in his next negotiations
6869215 it is a confirmed case as part of the larger outbreak
6869216 what we were able to confirm today was the cause of death and the cause of death is due to listeriosis
6869217 three are confirmed cases four are probable cases and one is a suspect case
6869218 constantly looking for it constantly swabbing and looking for it
6869219 this plant has an excellent food safety record excellent inspection record excellent external auditors well never know exactly how it got here
6869220 when we got up to eight or nine in the later part of july thats when we started asking health units could you go back and get us some more information
6869221 weve put in place a new system that allows us to detect an outbreak and to see a pattern very early in the game
6869222 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us
6869223 theres been some sort of failure to communicate in a timely manner so that the public could be made aware so that we could make the choices to make ourselves safe
6869224 most people would just have mild maybe flu like symptoms or just be asymptomatic but with the elderly there can be more severe symptoms and it can lead to meningitis encephalitis abscess and it can be fatal
6869225 refusing to acknowledge anything but spite paranoia and conspiracy theory when it comes to the other side
6869226 i didnt want to see a discussion of candidates for vice president without showing the house of representatives i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards and i hope he will be the nominee
6869227 for years our colleagues have said to him why dont you run for president
6869228 okay i unglue the feathered pillows of my face at 5 00 am daily and even the weekend believe it or not its of my own choice i guess i get up before the round magygeee called sun does when it come to time i love to salvage every dear second so to speak in my life to live to the fullest in every way possible so when i do get up at 5 even mind works better sharper quicker etc and the ironic part is i used to love to sleeeeeep in but hated feeling like a sleeepy ancient sleepy egyptian mummy latter in the day with a such a lag it was not funny beside that i do a lot of different things in this round planet call earth so i need as much time as possible and i do go to sleep at 10 00 pm not to mention im a writer and writhing a book takes a lot of time so sarah now you know about my cook clock and when it wakes me up so to speak let me see what maybe is the size of the bike and that can assist you better is their any other concerns for in regards to the bike robert
6869229 i have a real legitimate shot at making the chase and a great shot at running well this weekend
6869230 people long for a connection whether it is to music to their country or to a big idea regardless of what happens in november senator obama has reminded millions of people that they have the power to connect to bigger ideas he is in essence the embodiment of a new anthem for change i wanted to honor all of those millions of people especially young people who are for the first time feeling empowered to voice their beliefs as an artist i understand how rare it is to inspire a connection to a bigger idea or purpose this video isnt so much an endorsement of barack obama as much as it is a celebration of all those who have picked up a sign who have registered to vote and are working to make the world a better place
6869231 this is the time we finish what we started and this is no time to dream this is the room we can turn off the dark tonight maybe then we might see american prayer
6869232 we want to make the case for why barack obama is the best candidate for filipino americans and the strongest leader for addressing our issues such as immigration reform affordable healthcare and equity for filipino veterans
6869233 kaya ba kaya can we do it yes we can
6869234 the purpose of filipinos for obama is to get the community excited about the senators historic candidacy and give a voice to filipino americans in the political process this is an opportunity for the filipino community to claim its stake at the political table
6869235 this campaign were bringing it into our community use your talent time and treasure this is about us making an impact we need your people power to get out the vote
6869236 alright class may i have your attention we have a transferred student today and her name is yoshizawa hitomi please be nice to her
6869237 just call me yossie and the thing i hate the most is annoying people so dont bug me or ask any silly questions when its not needed
6869238 didnt i just say not to ask silly question and to answer your question its because i hate skirts
6869239 ok class settle down yossie please take a seat next to ishikawa rika shes sitting next to the window first row fourth seat
6869240 we heard that youre a talented detective and can break any case without a sweat in tokyo theres this ishikawa gang that has been smuggling in illegal cocaine and weapons and they made money through any illegal means
6869241 its easy to say that but we dont have any evidence everytime we sent spies they always end up missing or being killed so we want you to take this case
6869242 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
6869243 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
6869244 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father
6869245 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt
6869246 dont worry about that we can ask a permission for you to wear pants by the way change your name to hitomi to hide your idenity
6869247 so thats rika behind a scary father theres a cute daughter how ironic
6869248 olympic officials order probe into chinese gymnasts age voice of america
6869249 emmas like a sister to me so its going to be like really really weird
6869250 whatever the case is with his own selfishness the evidence of an internationally superior american generosity is impressive beginning with the numbers on our charitable giving we give twice as much as the british per capita and according to the american magazine seven times as much as the germans and 14 times as much as the italians even in inflation adjusted dollars the amount given each year just keeps getting larger and meanwhile we do far more volunteer work than in other industrialized countries

6869260 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
6869261 to practice and prescribe to the best of my ability for the good of my patients and to try to avoid harming them
6869262 should have been afforded a reasonable time to secure a certificate of merit after the trial court ruled than an expert is required and that a certificate is mandated
6869263 the underlying facts of this case demonstrate once again the absurd results likely to be reached by application of the medical professional liability act
6869264 what is the point of applying the mpla in this case
6869265 other than racking up additional fees for the defendants lawyers and additional costs for the plaintiffs lawyers
6869266 i snt it reasonable to conclude that dr vaidya is on notice by now that dr westmoreland intends to sue him
6869267 then requiring dr westmoreland to comply with the mpla is essentially to impose upon him a filing fee substantially different from that in every other type of lawsuit

6869389 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6869390 i just thought he was obviously a good football coach but also a very good communicator
6869391 i thought he had a good way about him he was bright eyed he had a great sense of humor a good laugh he wasnt stiff he was a guy that you knew related well to his players
6869392 its an exciting trip for me i have some good friends there
6869393 although i wasnt there a great deal of time it felt good to be a part of what we were building there i thought it was going to be potentially special i root for those guys because theyre close and personal friends of mine it will be professionalism of course on saturday night but it will be great to see them all players coaches front office people
6869394 he was my first defensive coordinator in the pros while he was here he taught me a whole lot and im still playing by some of his rules now

6869396 mike did a great job here and had a tremendous relationship with the players
6869397 just seeing him work with our defense and the way they came around in such a short period of time i was very impressed with what he did
6869398 he knew how to communicate with everybody and that was very big on my part
6869399 he always talked about being the best at what he does definitely going up to being a head coach and taking that next step and being the best is what hes trying to do
6869400 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court

6869418 the way that the media played durham like it was some kind of poor hick town where there was so much separation between black and white that was probably more disappointing

6869421 was sind ihre eindr cke von der infrastruktur den anlagen und der veranstaltung an sich
6869422 ich bin die strecke gestern abgelaufen und ich kann sagen dass dies sogar noch herausfordernder ist als sie im auto abzufahren besonders in der mittagshitze meiner meinung nach haben sie tolle arbeit geleistet es ist sehr beeindruckend was sie innerhalb von weniger als einem jahr auf die beine gestellt haben die strecke an sich ist wie die fahrer sagten kein wahrer stra en kurs er ist ziemlich schnell man hat auslaufzonen wie wir sie bisher auf keinem stra en kurs im kalender gesehen haben ich muss sagen dass ich wirklich beeindruckt bin
6869423 ist es besser f r die formel 1 auf historischen strecken zu fahren oder neue orte wie valencia oder singapur zu finden
6869424 es gibt kein entweder oder wir brauchen beides wir ben tigen sicherlich die traditionellen kurse wie spa die die formel 1 zu dem gemacht haben was sie heute ist wir ben tigen auch neue veranstaltungsorte wie diesen ort der ein wirklich aufregender ort ist wir sehen bei dieser strecke neue l sungen und es ist immer sehr gut an einen ort zu kommen an dem schon einige 100 000 menschen leben es ist aus diesem grund viel einfacher die menge anzuziehen valencia ist sicherlich eine strecke die in meinen augen eine gro artige zukunft vor sich hat
6869425 renault erzielt fortschritte das bedeutet mehr druck von hinten f r sie aber sie haben gesagt dass sie gegen die beiden teams vor ihnen k mpfen m chten
6869426 es ist nicht sch n wenn man nach hinten schauen muss wir machen druck nach vorn was ich damit zum ausdruck bringen wollte ist dass wir die ressourcen schon vom diesj hrigen auto auf das n chstj hrige auto gelenkt haben aber wir das diesj hrige auto nach wie vor entwickeln und f r die kommenden rennen ein paar entwicklungen in der pipeline haben wir machen immer noch druck nach vorn man kann keinerlei ergebnisse vorhersagen wir werden also schauen was wir tun k nnen
6869427 was habt ihr nach den vergangenen paar rennen getan wo habt ihr verloren und wo kann man wieder nach vorn kommen
6869428 nun definitiv haben wir uns nach budapest alle technischen daten angeschaut es war ein rennen zum vergessen f r das team wir haben die gr nde daf r identifiziert und sicherlich alles getan um sie aus der welt zu schaffen ich bin sehr zuversichtlich dass wir sie im griff haben
6869429 es gab heute morgen ein meeting der fota im toyota motorhome k nnen sie uns einblicke darin geben was gesprochen wurde
6869430 es war kein fota meeting sondern ein normales meeting der teamchefs und wir haben ber die zukunft und finanzielle fragen diskutiert wie wir den sport f r alle teams tragbar halten k nnen
6869431 im extremely thankful and honored by the confidence shown by my teammates in my leadership
6869432 its a great feeling to have that type of role in this football program youre part of something much bigger than yourself
6869433 when you think back on all the past captains at ohio state you realize what a great honor and opportunity this is
6869434 this team is a very special collection of remarkable people thats why i came back for another year to be around these guys
6869435 its unbelievable to have the chance to represent the type of player and people we have on this team as their captain for another year
6869436 with the number of outstanding leaders we have on our team i will work to lead everyone in every way i can on and off the field
6869437 first and foremost it humbles you to have the respect of your teammates in such a way is definitely an honor
6869438 the tradition of guys who have led this team in the past shows you what an honor it is
6869439 sarah thought telling jokes about her breakup would be a walk in the park but she was struck with a case of the jitters so severe she didnt know if shed be able to go on

6869441 her timing was dead on and the audience responded well to the new material which did include a few bittersweet reflections on her breakup
6869442 this summer has been one of the most memorable in years the beijing olympics have opened up an ancient city thats been elusive to visitors for thousands of years a new spirit of hope graces the world right now opening the doors for newfound respect between nations the question i ask myself often these days is how can we channel this new global attitude towards improving social and economic conditions everywhere fair trade establishes economic justice by giving indigenous peoples the ability to become self sufficient self sufficiency includes more than just survival self sufficiency includes having a living wage that sustains self reliance and respect which empowers even the poorest nation nations can build recover and grow with the self reliance inherent in the fair trade movement major athletic sponsors such as nike and adidas are making huge corporate profits from the beijing olympic games when you browse their websites youll find jackets pants and even sports balls related to the olympics selling for well over 100 are the prices of their products indicative of production costs unfortunately they are not adidas is the official sponsor of the beijing olympics and nike is a major contributor of sports equipment and uniforms for the teams both companies have less than stellar fair trade and employee rights records try a quick search on their brand names on the coop america website too often profits are pumped into the pockets of investors and celebrity athletes rather than the economies of the products producers this disrespects the integrity of those who work long hours in unhealthy conditions such a lifestyle deprives them of self sufficiency and is an injustice that destroys entire countries economies but i believe these large companies can change that change will occur when they are under enough pressure both external and internal external pressure from the market has proven a great force of change in many industries fair trade companies like mine provide actionable education through our blog that adidas and nike can use to begin their own certified fair trade and eco certified product lines we will count it as a victory when one of the top 5 multinational brands converts their sports ball line to certified fair trade like ours as the public becomes more educated by fair trade companies they are more likely to buy fair trade products and pressure larger athletic companies to comply internal pressure within multinational companies like adidas and nike can come through inspired employees and corporate managers willing to think holistically and make change towards a truly sustainable and thus ethical supply chain these folks do exist ive helped train some of them at the sustainable mba program bainbridge graduate institute global respect can be transferred to corporate respect the major athletic brands we see behind the olympics need to understand the crucial link between respect and economic justice by pumping their profits into respect for the indigenous workers they will get ten fold return on their corporate identity fair wages and healthy working conditions increase employee productivity and the entire communitys stability with fair trade it is possible to undo the years of economic injustice by simply giving authentic respect to the producers of our products
6869443 i have neither of my two partners from the last ryder cup
6869444 i mean olaz bal will be there but as a vice captain obviously luke with his wrist injury we are going to miss him for a while you know ive played with lee before and weve done well so that might be but i dont know what nick is thinking
6869445 you know im always happy to play with any of the newcomers and give them a little bit of how do you say like cheer them up and give them some confidence i think as an up and comer or as a rookie on the team its always nice when you play with one that has played some ryder cups well see but im sure that nick will do a great job and will mix everybody up nicely
6869446 obviously monty has done so much for the european team in the ryder cups and well see what happens
6869447 if he doesnt get to play obviously its something that we will miss
6869448 i knew if i let her play and her decide the points then it would be really difficult for me

6869451 the thigh was ok but actually i feel tired because of the olympic games the jet lag and everything
6869452 i need to play well this week and next week and so far this week ive done that

6869473 basically we are seeing a significant increase in our catalog sales as a result of d2r stores now have the opportunity to purchase titles that would have been much harder to get from distributors and were able to offer sales amp specials directly to the retailer that we could not offer through wholesalers team this with our immediate turnaround on orders and knowledgeable staff the result is very positive
6869474 the main advantage retailers are discovering is ordering back catalog items we always expected to do well in new releases but were going to win this battle in the catalog end of the business with the old method it was very difficult for a retailer to get the catalog because it was a cumbersome process wholesalers didnt carry it they cant carry everyones catalog so if a retailer wanted a catalog item theyd have to contact their wholesaler the wholesaler contacted us to find out what we have wed tell the wholesaler and then the wholesaler went back to the retailer then it had to be shipped from us to the wholesaler to the retailer retailers really like the fact that we can tell them exactly what we have and we can ship it out to them right away cutting out additional steps is a big big plus
6869475 the greek cypriot side has most recently put forward the return of guzelyurt as a precondition
6869476 however the turkish cypriot side always fails to put forward preconditions
6869477 if the turkish cypriot people will lose everything it has following a settlement which is if turkeys effective guarantee will be removed and limited only to the right of intervention than that agreement will not constitute a settlement

6869487 this school is 45 years old and in need of a major upgrade to continue to serve students
6869488 they havent looked at what this school means to the community
6869489 there is more to a schools value than just the nuts and bolts
6869490 to do a proper assessment you need to look at all the variables

6869507 new yorkers living in communities near newtown creek have suffered long enough
6869508 we know that there are dangerous chemicals in the soil water and air at sites around newtown creek its time to put the resources of the superfund program to work to conduct additional tests at known contamination hotspots to see whether a federal cleanup should go forward
6869509 hillary is one of the more intelligent active senators and is great on environmental issues
6869510 shes recognized also as being pragmatic hopefully she impresses upon the epa how serious the contamination issue is in newtown creek
6869511 the factories responsible for much of the chemical contamination have long since closed and as the cleanup authority of last resort
6869512 i see the federal superfund program as the most effective way to solve this longstanding problem once and for all

6869525 i really didnt know anything about cherries i went to california last year and cherries seemed to be a popular topic the valley seemed a good spot and we need the critical mass to see if the industry has a chance here
6869526 it will be interesting over the next five to 10 years to see how they do
6869527 the jurys still out on whether or not you need to cover them or not time will tell
6869528 theyre a hot topic worldwide and production has mushroomed theres huge money on the export market and there are a lot of perceived health benefits
6869529 but before anyone gets too excited the world demand is for big fruit and have challenges growing them here they are definitely not something you can plant and walk away from

6869539 on behalf of the department of health and human services and myself personally we deeply regret that mr sabock died and that it occurred while a patient at cherry hospital

6869541 im real honored that she and others in the congress thought id be a good vice presidential candidate im honored to have been considered
6869542 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6869543 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6869544 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6869550 i think the key is the same that we did last time really put pressure on their guards
6869551 obviously pao gasol is going to be tough inside but i thought our bigs did a great job last time
6869552 ranks up there because one youre representing your country and i think the reason why it really ranks up there is the fact that we lost in oh four and this is the type of situation where were trying to bounce back

6869554 the u s a team combines technical ability physicality and discipline which they didnt show in previous tournaments
6869555 we put them on the line in the second quarter at the 8 10 mark
6869556 any time a team can go to the line and continue to make free throws it allows their defense to set up it takes away from our strength which is running
6869557 we got some good looks we didnt knock them down and then we fouled and put them on the free throw line
6869558 i think you saw that by how we came out of the gate and i think when ginobili got hurt we kind of let up a little bit they made some shots went into a zone and we didnt penetrate or do anything to get in the gaps
6869559 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6869560 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6869561 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6869562 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6869563 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6869564 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6869582 the russian government has few people with the mentality of statesmen
6869583 today the aim of many people is to become rich at the expense of the state
6869584 every russian who thinks is worried about this unfortunately there are no signs this will change
6869585 these days the economy is dependent on natural resource exports which is just a temporary bonanza these resources sooner or later will be depleted
6869586 if youre running gazprom a russian natural gas producer but you dont really own it then your interest is maximizing short term profits not long term development
6869587 if you look at most of the russian companies the energy companies thats precisely whats happened they have focused on profits or dividends and less so on long term development and replacing reserves

6869608 he took out some power lines reminiscent of the 1998 incident in which a marine corps jet sliced through the cables of a gondola at an italian ski resort killing 20 which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral

6869611 i recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country
6869612 it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered

6869614 its extremely difficult because failure breeds failure and contributors are less likely to spend money on a losing cause
6869615 republicans just need to adapt to the conditions in each individual state because if this election is a referendum on the state of the country then theyre going to do very badly
6869616 the only thing i can do is tell the judges to do their job and end this now quit dragging this on for everybody
6869617 luckily in both of the incidents no one was injured but throwing items from bridges on to unsuspecting motorists can have tragic consequences and is something to be taken seriously

6869653 the bag in box protects it from the oxidation and the damaging effects of light on the flavor
6869654 we fought to defend our quality label by focusing our production on quality wines only if you fill in a tetra pak with good wine the prestige of our products will sink

6869696 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6869697 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6869698 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6869699 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important

6869706 sometimes people talk about this as a passport to the er
6869707 they take enough so it looks like theyre having a miscarriage and then they have an aspiration procedure
6869708 she talked about how when she first came to the u s she came to the pharmacy to get birth control pills and she was told she needed a prescription
6869709 she knew that abortion was legal in the u s
6869710 but she thought that is was only for people who are legal residents
6869711 ive seen a real increase in the blogs and the chatter in the herb chat rooms about this lately
6869712 women came in a lot asking for herbs to causing a miscarriage
6869713 i was shocked actually how many women came looking for natural abortifacients
6869714 the most common way is that women take herbs that are poisonous and take enough to poison the baby but not themselves
6869715 this is not easy to do unless the woman is sick enough to be throwing up and in serious pain its not going to work
6869716 i had a woman come in with spotting bleeding and she was throwing up she was really sick
6869717 we want to find what some of the barriers to reproductive health are
6869718 i think thats really what this issue is all about
6869719 hope youre all having a wonderful summer this is actually the first summer where i didnt just lounge around in st tropez or a private beach somewhere i didnt take a vacation this summer because its been non stop work
6869720 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6869721 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
6869722 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6869723 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
6869724 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf
6869725 these findings shed light on why in listening environments such as noisy parties or restaurants it is more difficult to follow a conversation involving many people where the relevant talker often and unexpectedly changes locations than to focus on one talker at one location exclusively
6869726 in addition these results may have implications for visual attention in tasks where object formation and target segmentation is challenging or where the identity of a visual object depends upon continuity of visual features over time
6869727 there are quite a number of outstanding issues and therefore i encouraged the director general to convene senior officials sooner rather than later
6869728 but it depends largely on the seriousness of purpose commitment flexibility of the key players and grandstanding isnt going to do it
6869729 cinco razones por las que el iphone es un tel fono diferente
6869730 el iphone conquista a cualquiera que lo tenga en las manos
6869731 recibir un sms en un iphone 3g es una experiencia totalmente diferente a recibirlo en cualquier otro terminal
6869732 20 horas de espera ante las puertas de la tienda de telef nica en madrid no son nada si consiguen hacerse con el preciado tel fono multimedia de ltima generaci n famoso por su dise o y prestaciones
6869733 dicen los que esperan que hay buen ambiente en la cola y que merece la pena acampar toda una noche a la intemperie en plena gran v a madrile a
6869734 el nuevo iphone ya causa furor en el mundo entero
6869735 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6869736 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6869737 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6869738 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6869739 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6869740 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco
6869741 nick naylor had been called many things since becoming chief spokesman for the academy of tobacco studies but until now no one had actually compared him to satan
6869742 it was likely an unmanned aerial vehicle that dropped the bomb
6869743 they have returned to god to complain about the oppression of the americans and the injustice of the pakistani government
6869744 he is not a very inspiring man in contrast to osama bin laden and has proven to make some enemies in al qaeda
6869745 the review the matter to see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6869746 you shouldnt regard this as some kind of formal investigation
6869747 the ioc is simply wanting to do its duty and work with the federation to 100 percent clarify the situation
6869748 these documents have already been clarified things have been cleared up
6869749 the eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and authorized by the international federation and if they havent been cleared they would not be able to participate in the games
6869750 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc
6869751 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6869752 because the competition is so strong and close between the u s and chinese teams weve come under this level of scrutiny and pressure
6869753 we are telling the cheats there wont be possibility to cheat anymore
6869754 because they are not just cheating themselves they are cheating other athletes from taking their victory ceremonies from carrying their flags around to hearing their national anthems so i think i would not stop fighting
6869755 because if they do theyre going to find what bloggers and reporters have already found that the chinese cheated
6869756 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6869757 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6869758 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6869759 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6869760 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6869761 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6869762 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6869763 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6869764 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6869765 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6869766 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6869767 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6869768 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6869769 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
6869770 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
6869771 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
6869772 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
6869773 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen

6869783 i think the rapid growth in russian military spending definitely bears watching
6869784 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6869785 an attack upon one is an attack upon all and thats the strongest possible guarantee you can have
6869786 the russians arent about to launch some military action to the poles but they might take some specific measures to counter it like moving short range missiles closer to the border
6869787 i think its mostly saber rattling but we ignore it at our own peril as we learned in georgia
6869788 the way they conducted the operation was like a well oiled machine but thats not to say the russian military is a well oiled machine
6869789 by saturday morning the georgian political leadership decided not to resist and began a military withdrawal so it was not a true test
6869790 does demonstrate the russian militarys renewed ability to prosecute a relatively complex high intensity combined arms operation
6869791 the russians were not that stellar in the execution of this operation
6869792 i think its more a case of the lack of an opponent in south ossetia and a lack of an army to fight when they got there than it is a credit to the russians
6869793 ukraines military is much larger its a much larger country
6869794 but most people dont want to find out how credible that threat is
6869795 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy

6869797 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans

6869800 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6869801 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6869802 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans

6869805 politico has learned that mccain will visit suburban st louis for a major rally with romney and his still bitter primary nemesis mike huckabee on sunday aug 31 the day before the start of the gop convention top missouri republicans yesterday received the invitation for a rally featuring mccain and his two top primary challengers theyll be joined by country star john rich at a minor league baseball stadium in ofallon mo about 35 miles west of st louis missouri was hard fought territory on super tuesday with each of the three republicans faring well so the event would seem to represent a pre convention unity rally in a swing state where each has a strong following but huckabee and romney can hardly stand one another and huckabee has warned twice this month against selecting his once and perhaps future rival
