8130000 i have never come across a prime minister like manmohan singh who has generously agreed to all our proposals this shows how sincere and committed the prime minister is to the welfare and development of the state
8130001 i think all these time bound projects would help develop assam by leaps and bounds
8130002 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8130003 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8130004 it started in the loungeroom on one side of the house and it just took the rest of it within two minutes
8130005 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8130006 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8130007 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8130008 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8130009 currently in the legislation it says you have to have a smoke alarm on every floor in a house what were saying is you should have smoke alarm in every bedroom
8130010 the impact of the credit crisis on the real estate environment and markets everywhere has been unprecedented in recent history chief executive nic lyons said
8130011 there are no plans that i know of to change the agreement but you know in life you never rule things out
8130012 but its obviously got to be something that both the united states and india you know can agree to if there were going to be changes but ive heard no mention of a need to you know adjust the agreement in any way
8130013 we are aware that the congressional clock is ticking and we are going to be consulting with other governments particularly governments in the nuclear suppliers group to try to move this process forward as quickly as we can
8130014 there are a number of concerns that some countries have about whats been about the agreement but they are good questions and we think weve got good answers to those
8130015 and we have discussions with governments about these issues and we will do our best to address those concerns as the indians are trying to do to address concerns other governments may have about the agreement
8130016 we conducted this study in italy where we picked up 44 infants and divided them into two groups to carry out two sets of experiments we exposed them to about 22 minutes of recordings of the above mentioned words
8130017 while they were exposed to the recordings we monitored the oxygen levels in blood in their brain areas we found that when the babies heard the words papa daddy and mommy the blood oxygen level in certain brain areas went up it showed those brain areas became active on hearing these words papa mommy and thus needed more oxygen
8130018 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8130019 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8130020 what kind of education revolution would cut money to public schools
8130021 its a 1 8 per cent decrease in real funding for public schools during the life of the next four year agreement
8130022 we are already boosting funding for education thats what our trades training centres in schools are all about thats what the digital revolution is all about
8130023 weve already started rolling out our 2 5 billion investment in trades training centres in schools our 1 2 billion investment in the digital education revolution and the list goes on
8130024 the last budget was a budget in which education was a centrepiece
8130025 we are in active negotiations about the schools funding agreement for the next four years and those negotiations will be announced through the council of australian governments process
8130026 im not going to allow an aeu report to derail that incredibly important set of negotiations
8130027 you will find on a yearly basis the funding is very small
8130028 we should not be conned by announcement that talk about funding over 10 year periods
8130029 we conducted this study in italy where we picked up 44 infants and divided them into two groups to carry out two sets of experiments we exposed them to about 22 minutes of recordings of the above mentioned words
8130030 while they were exposed to the recordings we monitored the oxygen levels in blood in their brain areas we found that when the babies heard the words papa daddy and mommy the blood oxygen level in certain brain areas went up it showed those brain areas became active on hearing these words papa mommy and thus needed more oxygen
8130031 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8130032 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8130033 who you know is as important as what you know
8130034 german carmakers want co2 targets to only apply to the cleanest cars in the early years its the equivalent of demanding that a smoking ban should only apply to non smokers
8130035 we will see a much higher increase in dismissals as we are going to go into a recession
8130036 i think its going to easily last a couple of years or longer a recession historically lasts for a couple of years and i can see no reason why it would be shorter than that
8130037 when you have a major car manufacturer like mitsubishi close and another manufacturer like ford reduce its volume substantially and gm holden in a lacklustre position the components companies have reduced orders and redundancies at component manufacturers as a consequence
8130038 tassal is well positioned to benefit from the investments made in 2008
8130039 tassal is experiencing strong earnings momentum and expects to achieve an underlying net profit after tax of 30 million for fiscal 2009 in line with its previous guidance
8130040 our balance sheet is strong with low gearing which will allow tassal to aggressively pursue both organic and acquisitive growth
8130041 the unconvention is an umbrella that provides a non partisan response to the rnc
8130042 we are trying to provide something other than what we get will get at the rnc we need to get past the expected scripted conversation and look at what participatory politics mean this is a non traditional way of getting at the issues
8130043 its about forgetting the partisan posturing and celebrating the shared values of liberty freedom justice equality and free speech
8130044 is a testimonial to the impact of eight years of extreme judicial legislative and executive actions on the american democratic institution from the landmark bush vs gore decision in 2000 forward
8130045 it is dancing where dancing doesnt belong practiced in public and semi public places such as museums or downtown elevators
8130046 like an invigorating wayward wind this work of choreography unburdens everyday life
8130047 i really just had to whisper to a few friends that i wanted to do a poster show about peace and democracy and a tidal wave of creative talent showed up the real value of a poster is that it is a tangible beautiful ownable artifact of a hopeful progressive voice
8130048 we want to create a safe respectful and positive experience for both local artists and activists and anyone visiting the twin cities
8130049 too nicey nice and too non partisan good for the folks from the suburbs
8130050 we have them write a paper about why they want to be teachers
8130051 most of them will say i used to pretend i was a teacher when i was a little kid
8130052 teaching is a noble profession but it shouldnt require a vow of poverty salaries are a problem teachers make 20 000 a year less than other professionals with comparable education and salaries havent been keeping pace with inflation the cost of health insurance is driving teachers into other professions a lack of mentoring and support can make new teachers feel very isolated particularly when todays students have such complex needs
8130053 we look for what we call disposition the disposition to teach its not enough just to love kids you have to have more than that you have to have a lot of patience you have to have dedication to the profession you have to be able to get along well not just with children but with colleagues and you have to be an excellent communicator communication is key in education today because youre working with parents colleagues and administrators so we look for all of those skills
8130054 i come home and i may still have papers to grade and lesson plans to think about for the following day its hard to define when my school day is done and when my personal life begins
8130055 you can have maybe five hours of roughly 30 students and if you do even just two assignments a week thats 300 papers a week that you have to correct youre given a prep hour every day but theres just no way you can get it all done and thats just correcting planning creating tests and creating assignments too
8130056 we had one copy machine for a school of 2 000
8130057 if you run out i think i ran out in march i couldnt make any more copies unless i begged them off of other teachers
8130058 there are kids who really want to do well and want to be challenged and in the same class there are kids who could care less and are only there because they are required to be because they are under 16 its difficult to inspire those bottom level kids while keeping the top level kids challenged enough and you cant ignore the middle kids who are working hard but maybe are still struggling
8130059 what is most depressing is when i get a student who comes with so many issues that i feel ill equipped to deal with im not a social worker im not a psychiatrist
8130060 i wanted to get more into the individual aspects of working with students when youre teaching youre teaching a group of kids and that can be anywhere from 30 to 40 kids and you want to service everybody
8130061 some students have issues going on at home that theyre battling with and you can see the distraction in the classroom
8130062 we cant deal with a lot of the mental health issues because were so focused on getting students to graduate that we miss the social emotional pieces i thought that just by being here as a teacher for six years and then by being a counselor i would be able to change some of that but its bigger than me
8130063 as a teacher you cant really be involved in the larger picture the decision making
8130064 teaching candidates need to know what the work day is going to be like and that there are going to be frustrations and that theyre not going to be able to affect a lot of change
8130065 but i know how girls learn and i know that one of the key things that makes learning relevant for women and girls is having to do with anything that relates to people
8130066 salaries are low for teachers when compared to salaries for other professions and that lowers prestige and social value
8130067 i dont think you should go into it for the money but if teaching were somehow presented as a more lucrative career then maybe more men would go into it i wish society could shift their perception of what teachers do and how valuable they are
8130068 teachers stay because there is nothing more rewarding than helping children reach their potential its remarkable to see a child engage in learning and grow intellectually
8130069 you can go home feeling good about all the things you did with the thought that maybe you are the only person who has done something good for that child that day
8130070 the students ive worked with have been wonderful ive been fortunate to be able to work with students in difficult circumstances who would show up with big smiles on their faces happy to be at school
8130071 no your kid is not hyperactive or spoiled theyre just too far ahead of everyone else and frustrated by the restraints of society because theyre indigo
8130072 kinda creepy people who took the whole goth look and death blood fetish waaaay too far to the point of being a little disgusting and unsettling and who probably need to get a real life and might want to see a therapist too because i would not be surprised if they had some really weird repressed stuff going on
8130073 australia has a bid to host the 2018 world cup
8130074 so i have asked minister amorim to contemplate whether brazil might be able to give us some assistance in that respect
8130075 i think the building is fantastic but because of delays here we are in the start of the semester and its not complete
8130076 we have faculty now that can talk with their peers it is a much more collegial set up with more library spaces and lots of common public space so students can talk
8130077 near the end of the design plans they asked us to add a fourth floor which we added without an extension to the project timetable
8130078 its one of the few buildings on campus that has gone up as fast as it has
8130079 these guys have been so fabulous theyre there all day long to push everything through
8130080 having to start school today was frustrating but thats one of those circumstances that happens
8130081 we now all have good heating air conditioning and fantastic lobbies
8130082 its good because the overall location is more central on campus and im closer to colleagues in other departments like philosophy and those in lnco and osh
8130083 we had our classrooms all on the upper part of lower campus it was all uphill with my laptop and my bag
8130084 the history department now has nice seminar and conference rooms and its so much easier to park
8130085 parking in the back is much more convenient than the football stadium or heaven forbid parking behind carlson hall
8130086 carlson hall was always very isolated but we used to have closets and lots of space
8130087 the university has to build to certain regulations and carlson hall was built before those regulations
8130088 the new offices are only half the size of our old ones which used to be dorms for women
8130089 but this building is not at all attractive in terms of its shape and the building materials though once you step inside the atrium it is very nice
8130090 a lot of attention was paid to how light works in the building
8130091 there will be tons of natural light with windows from floor to ceiling in all of those public spaces
8130092 while i am very pleased with the 2008 result against a background of financial turmoil and economic uncertainty the year should be viewed as a period of transition in the history of premier a year which has provided the platform for future growth
8130093 we have also successfully positioned the company to benefit from the full ownership of a business with a substantial presence in the australian retail sector
8130094 ibms ballarat expansion will be a major boost for the local economy with the investment to increase education and skills in the region
8130095 over the next five years it will create 300 jobs and is expected to contribute an additional 61 million to the regions economy
8130096 ibm has been a key factor in ensuring that the university of ballarats technology park is australias leading regional technology park with 1 350 employees across 30 enterprises
8130097 clearly what were seeing is the economy is growing at a slower rate and some companies are laying off staff but other companies are actually taking advantage of victorias economy and creating jobs
8130098 we have asked our officials to prepare a joint plan of action dealing with the range of interests and issues that we have
8130099 our relations are growing fast they are much more modest than they should be in terms of trade
8130100 but i am glad to see that investment is growing and it is on both sides
8130101 we appreciate very much the work being done by australia in terms of law and order and also support of the united nations
8130102 brazil is the country that has had the most experience in the area of ethanol
8130103 once our warehouses were full we had to rent a badminton court just to store them
8130104 it has cost us a lot of money to launder and store the clothes so we decided it would be better just to auction them
8130105 just a week after the quake we told people to stop sending us secondhand clothes but they kept on coming
8130106 people would just dump them on the ground and leave we received as many clothes in the three months after the quake as we had in the past three years
8130107 steam him include a repetition riot this above the occlusive sand colored supposition blink at a website
8130108 our goal is to show that a lot of young students are in support of john mccain
8130109 since colorado is a swing state we felt we needed to come and help during this convention
8130110 all of the kids here feel that we need to show that john mccain has a grassroots movement that is just as strong actually stronger than obamas
8130111 i was worried that i would be surrounded by a bunch of democrats that wouldnt want us to be here and would be rude and angry
8130112 being surrounded by other republicans who are unified toward a common goal
8130113 we are trying to convert the people on the fence and energize those already on our side
8130114 we are doing mainstream medias job that they havent been doing
8130115 we have got a candidate that has been unexamined we went back and talked to senators folks in chicago to get the full story
8130116 i am not going to tell anyone how to vote but i do think they need to know the truth
8130117 if you want to elect obama elect him with your eyes wide open
8130118 they have been helping us by getting people excited and getting the word out
8130119 i think it is great that they are out here
8130120 it is good to see diversity and students willing to express their differences i think that as they talk to people they will certainly make a difference with voters
8130121 barack obama is one of the most exciting candidates weve had certainly in our students lifetime and i think in my lifetime
8130122 hes charismatic hes young hes good looking and he gives the best speeches but i think even beyond all of those things hes run a very populist type of campaign
8130123 it creates this kind of rock star feeling and it gives younger people some empowerment because they see others who are so excited
8130124 its kind of a perfect storm of events and occurrences and circumstances
8130125 of all demographics young people are experiencing probably the greatest impact from the iraq war they are the most progressive on climate change and they really see this as a critical time in terms of the state of the economy with things like student debt college affordability and jobs
8130126 its not just because of his youthfulness although that definitely doesnt hurt
8130127 its more that hes in touch with what young people care about not because hes young but because his policy proposals actually address the issues they care about and the cherry on top is definitely his tactics like his extensive use of the internet and social networking sites he valued young voters earlier on in the campaign and more than any of the other candidates
8130128 the u student population in general seems to be much more interested in this coming election
8130129 and i would say thats mainly due to obama he just sort of has a presence about him that i think appeals to the younger generation a lot im a senior now and the friends i made my freshman year just didnt care anything about politics now if you ask them they are watching everything and keeping track of whats going on
8130130 i have a strong commitment to higher education and want to make it as strong and accessible as possible allocating resources is probably the biggest issue we face in utah weve got to have more adequate funding and ill work to make that happen
8130131 i had a fantastic experience at the university of utah when i was a student
8130132 ive stayed involved with the school in various ways and ill do my best as a regent to continue supporting the university
8130133 hes got a ton of experience and will be a great fit i think were all excited to have him on board
8130134 it is scary to think about because you wake up one day go off to work or school and then by the time you come home you see this mountain on fire
8130135 half of the houses have been evacuated and it is just scary to know what will happen next and if it will be ok
8130136 when fire moves there is a possibility ash could go into someones yard or roof if there is anything at all that could burn it will
8130137 we have about 160 people out there today 140 are out on the mountain working on containment or working with the helicopter
8130138 also there are about 120 involving united fire authority engines we still have structure protection engines as a precaution
8130139 our role has been to protect the homes they actually saved a few homes in big hollow throughout the night while looking for spot fires
8130140 we have not been evacuated however we can see flames from my bedroom window
8130141 whenever theres a gust of wind we can see it flare up
8130142 the fire was only about two miles from my house
8130143 i was not evacuated but i was informed to stay indoors so i wouldnt breathe all that smoke i decided to water the lawn just as a precaution i actually went up the mountain to get closer to where the fire was and it was pretty impressive it was hard to breath and the flames were right above me
8130144 the only real way that this fire has affected me is that it has made me think about what i would do if south mountain the ridge south of corner canyon caught on fire
8130145 its important for us to have an evacuation plan because if a fire ever starts the whole thing would burn up in an instant putting a lot of people and their homes in jeopardy in a very short time
8130146 they need to be prepared they need to know what they are going to take pets children and family photo albums are usually first on the list but things like birth certificates are also pretty critical
8130147 in light of this incident i hope that draper city will take more notice of the amount of dead and dry bushes grass or weeds and will require them to be cut down and removed from residential areas in order to prevent more incidents like what we saw on monday
8130148 we do see large fires its hard this is the time of year when we see the most extreme fire behavior
8130149 it depends on the conditions and how close it is to homes unfortunately it was human caused but we dont know any more at this time
8130150 the public has been exceptionally good over the past few years about putting out campfires not using fireworks and doing everything that they are supposed to do
8130151 whenever you have wildland that bumps up against what we call the wildland human interface it can increase the firestarts the percentages build up along the interface
8130152 obama has a way of rallying college age hype and students have been fed up with iraq and the economy
8130153 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8130154 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8130155 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8130156 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8130157 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8130158 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8130159 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8130160 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8130161 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8130162 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8130163 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8130164 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
8130165 oh yeah i went there spent a week in bangkok
8130166 these definitions have no tendency to show that tomatoes are fruit as distinguished from vegetables in common speech or within the meaning of the tariff act
8130167 tomatoes have 9 13 species which are a window into a fascinating group of plants
8130168 our overall theme is to increase accessibility of wild species and decide what crosses you can make and what you can cross and cant cross
8130169 what explains the dysfunction at the dark heart of our politics
8130170 into a brawling beer drinking buddy of the working man george w
8130171 on closer inspection the country we have inhabited for the last three decades seems more like a panorama of madness and delusion of sturdy patriots reciting the pledge while they resolutely strangle their own life chances of small farmers proudly voting themselves off the land of devoted family men carefully seeing to it that their children will never be able to afford college or proper health care of hardened blue collar workers in midwestern burgs cheering as they deliver up a landslide for a candidate whose policies will end their way of life
8130172 sin el don de la vida no es posible ejercer otro derecho
8130173 la defensa de un ser humano reci n concebido debe acompa arse de la defensa de la dignidad de la mujer respetar el derecho a la vida se encuentra en la base de la aut ntica democracia y del verdadero estado de derecho

8130176 la dignidad humana no depende de la cultura raza sexo convicciones pol ticas creencias religiosas desarrollo de las capacidades intelectuales o edad de la persona todo ser humano posee la misma dignidad y merece el mismo respeto en sus derechos fundamentales
8130177 ninguna situaci n por excepcional que sea justifica que alguien lastime la dignidad de las personas en especial de las m s vulnerables las marginadas o indefensas la defensa valerosa de un reci n concebido debe estar acompa ada de la defensa igualmente decidida de la dignidad de la mujer que vive un embarazo inesperado
8130178 trabajar para que ninguna mujer se sienta condenada rechazada sola o abandonada al encontrarse en esa situaci n es un deber humano atender solidariamente a la mujer que lleva un hijo en su vientre de este acompa amiento depende en buena medida que el aborto no sea la opci n a escoger
8130179 hoy m s que nunca garantizar el derecho a la vida y de manera igual para todos es un deber de cuyo cumplimiento depende el futuro de la humanidad
8130180 cuando en una sociedad se debate la despenalizaci n del aborto lo que en el fondo se discute es el futuro de una naci n reconocer y respetar el derecho a la vida se encuentra en la base de la aut ntica democracia y del verdadero estado de derecho
8130181 la misi n que hoy tiene la suprema corte de justicia de la naci n al analizar las leyes que despenalizan el aborto en el distrito federal

8130184 oye t o por qu no insultas a tu padre y dejas al m o en paz
8130185 se necesitan intervenciones para evitar que el eccema aumente la sensibilidad y aparezca el asma especialmente en los varones
8130186 por lo tanto no sorprende ver un efecto distinto del eccema sobre el riesgo de asma en varones y mujeres
8130187 esto es una maquinaci n del gobierno sudan s y algunos delincuentes
8130188 nosotros denunciamos y condenamos este acto queremos la protecci n de los civiles dondequiera que se encuentren esta es una conspiraci n sucia para difamar

8130190 mi padre era ge logo y no viv amos en el centro de las ciudades no hab a nada pero estaban los libros
8130191 la suerte fue que por entonces harry potter funcionaba pero no tanto si no hubiera sido imposible comprar acciones de la editorial
8130192 pero nos cost mucho que los medios se interesaran por ella
8130193 primero reeditas cada dos meses luego cada mes y luego semanalmente y piensas aqu pasa algo
8130194 se trata de que nadie sepa el final de que cada lector se enfrente a la historia con ingenuidad
8130195 s a pesar de que impuls las ventas rowling hoy pensar a lo mismo pero cuando le compraron los derechos acababa de publicar el primero y necesitaba dinero
8130196 adem s el libro que tiene mucho xito lo aparcamos de la contabilidad general como si no existiera es injusto porque tambi n ocupa tiempo y recursos pero es la nica manera de que no nos creamos que podemos descansarlo todo sobre un t tulo
8130197 era que se nos comiera la editorial no quer amos ser los editores de un solo libro
8130198 its been a while ive been doing some things on my own but its not quite the same as if youre out there with the team and doing some of the different drills at practice
8130199 anywhere from a couple of weeks to a major injury
8130200 today is an extremely sad day for the trail blazers family
8130201 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8130202 and i have received an explanation which is that he refutes the suggestion
8130203 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8130204 obviously this is a matter in front of the privileges committee theres a conflict of evidence the committee is in the middle of a process no doubt theyll wish to hear from mr peters and i think the matters really best left with the privileges committee to pursue at the moment
8130205 i think we really need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8130206 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8130207 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand
8130208 winstons in a spot now where the whole world is wrong and only winston is right im afraid its winston peters credibility that has been shot to bits
8130209 i normally dont talk about my personal life but his name is raj kundra we met a year ago
8130210 for the next 18 months ive got my hands full with work so i cant really think of marriage yet but after that i definitely want it to culminate in marriage and of course im dying to have a family at least two children
8130211 i spoke to her and we exchanged numbers it was really emotional i can only ask people to pray for her because there is a lot of power in prayers

8130213 orders for phased relaxation of curfew have been issued to all the district magistrates of the valley the decision was taken tuesday evening at a high level meet chaired by governor n n vohra
8130214 the district magistrates will decide the timing for curfew relaxation in consultation with the security forces in order to ensure that the people can move about without any hindrance during the relaxation period
8130215 it depends upon the law and order situation in the area during the curfew relaxation period
8130216 we believe that this investigation of the irs is completely unfounded and politically motivated
8130217 there is a very clear effort national in scale to discredit defame and intimidate ministries and preachers of what has come to be called the
8130218 those behind these attacks we will for the moment only identify as enemies of the gospel often politically motivated they are fearful not only of the moral imperative communicated by these ministries but the growing wealth and influence of those constituencies in the natural world money is power and influence so a wealthy church individually and collectively is without question going to gain increasing visibility and influence in its city state and nation the opponents of christian ideology rightly understand that to limit our influence they must limit our growing wealth and to accomplish this goal they must undermine and corrupt the commitment of the donor base
8130219 the media allegations mean little or nothing if you keep the larger context in mind our individual level of wealth according to god eph 3 20 can potentially exceed what we can even ask or think limited only by the power of faith that works in us
8130220 i refuse to ever be embarrassed or apologetic for the level of gods blessing upon my life and believe every day that my preaching will have the same effect upon your life
8130221 having one door in the front and another one on the back alley isnt safe there needs to be a door on the side thats the main reason for the purchase of the house
8130222 tying up the 2800 vacant lot to assure that there would be parking
8130223 a theater use has long been the dream of the community but whats important is to get a positive use that will work financially
8130224 we need a plan in place to give us the legal authority to carry out certain development activities the reason were putting it in place right now is because we think were going to pursue purchase of the house hillcrest bought it because they thought it would be helpful to have it for the project we are negotiating that the sale with them right now
8130225 is their anyway to be sure that the movie will be released in january or not

8130240 heya his belfast accent isnt tooo bad but its not great either he has a quiff in the movie and it looks hilarious im afraid i cant tell yuo too much concerning the movie but i can tell you that there is a scene in which he gets beat up quite severely and yeah he is a pretty much badass in it anything else you want to know
8130241 everytime i go its just pretentious victoria girls walking round with sour bakes only good thing is the tequila super soaker things
8130242 victoria is a school in belfast where pretty much 99 9 of the girls are reaaal sluts and really annoying and think theyre a lot hotter than they are and sour bakes is a colloquialism for looking grumpy all the time haha
8130243 aj lmao you the most impatient of them all first you whined and cried about seeing rupert do another movie and now that he has you still aint satisfied girl you are one hot mess

8130248 do you know of the 27 storey residence building in bombay
8130249 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8130250 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8130251 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8130252 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8130253 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8130254 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter
8130255 they were extremely successful years we did every possible tv show we did it all there were ups and downs like in everything but ralph was my friend and a great singer and i have the greatest admiration for him
8130256 the official study released so far certainly doesnt support the contention that the tank would have survived intact to the ground in fact despite its optimistic over simplifications the released study indicates that the tank would certainly have demised high up in the atmosphere

8130269 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8130270 shes had to really swallow hard but now shes swallowed and moved on
8130271 from time to time she still wallows in self pity and should have beens but shes fine now and planning her future
8130272 were concerned about the message coming out that the county might limit growth in one of the most viable corridors
8130273 the cbc is concerned about the route 288 corridor we want monitoring of the reservoir for water quality without an overzealous move to try to change before there is a need
8130274 at no point did any of the staff or a majority of the board members indicate support for tighter restrictions on non residential development
8130275 the board should have not even considered 16 with the water quality data we had
8130276 you cant support an ordinance without data because you dont know that it will do any good and its very burdensome to business chesterfield is loaded with regulations with unintended consequences i think we should review the cost of these regulations before we vote on them
8130277 we want to encourage new business development but not at the expense of our environment
8130278 we want to grow business strategically and have it properly placed
8130279 i think the county is trying to properly allocate the costs of government services
8130280 the board and mr stegmaier are doing everything possible so the economic development department can attract more business to chesterfield
8130281 chesterfield county has been very supportive of our growth and has been very business friendly to dupont
8130282 we have a very good relationship with the county and receive very good support for our investment here the largest dupont plant in the country being brand new to virginia i made a choice to live in chesterfield
8130283 our pro business board of supervisors is looking to the future to ensure the countys comprehensive plan embraces strategic economic growth
8130284 chesterfield has a long history of fostering a supportive and profitable environment for businesses through our economic development initiatives such as fast track permitting and the recent expansion of our enterprise zone program
8130285 that save you a boatload of time and money the predevelopment meetings with the planning department tell you where you stand and its free
8130286 it shows a strong focus on long term sustainability not to mention a more aesthetic use of the space
8130287 qualified development team to plan design construct and own manage some components of the development
8130288 i think that it is worthwhile to evaluate using space in the new development for a student operated business venture
8130289 in my opinion such a space should become part of existing entrepreneurial programs
8130290 while providing enough turnover to make the space as accessible as possible
8130291 privatized bookstore could be an anchor for a retail development on the site

8130293 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8130294 come november will i really not vote at all or worse vote for mccain

8130299 we can and should address global warming without succumbing to the no growth radicalism that treats climate questions as dogma rather than as situations to be managed responsibly
8130300 our existing garages do not have the capacity to serve any significant increases in development

8130314 i am writing to you to urge you to oppose an exemption for india from the rules of the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group nsg
8130315 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
8130316 the us india nuclear agreement effectively grants india the privileges of nuclear weapons states nws despite the fact that india developed nuclear weapons outside the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt regime the agreement doesnt even require india to accept the same responsibilities as other states i e full scope iaea safeguards for non nws and a commitment from nws to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of nuclear weapons
8130317 momentum has a 25 year history and a leadership position in large scale enterprise level managed hosting over the past year we also added services directed at small and medium sized businesses we believe that our broad experience will ensure a seamless transition for customers who will now benefit from our expanded service offerings
8130318 pure play hosting represented only a portion of broadspires overall business but consisted of some very strong customer relationships we are pleased to have found these customers the ideal home with a strong focused organization that places an extremely high value on service we were approached by many firms that were interested in this transaction but selected momentum because we felt they could ensure continuity in the quality of service that our customers have come to expect and bridge the gap to serve large and small customers alike

8130321 many other acts of terror even recently that are comparable
8130322 e verybody in the world knows that americans are geographically challenged and historically challenged
8130323 and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable and there are other acts of terror that have gone on in places like bosnia that we forgot to notice
8130324 i think i was on the side of justice and ultimately it will be seen that way
8130325 i dont think our move was so much towards violence

8130329 orders for phased relaxation of curfew have been issued to all the district magistrates of the valley the decision was taken tuesday evening at a high level meet chaired by governor n n vohra
8130330 the district magistrates will decide the timing for curfew relaxation in consultation with the security forces in order to ensure that the people can move about without any hindrance during the relaxation period
8130331 it depends upon the law and order situation in the area during the curfew relaxation period
8130332 a high alert has been sounded in the jammu due to the infiltration of three terrorists from across the international border security forces have launched a massive search operation in the entire area

8130341 i am here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york as a proud american and as a proud supporter of barack obama
8130342 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kid were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8130343 when she became argumentative or she became forceful they said shes bitchy and there were comments about what she was wearing and how she looked sometimes from other women it was disgusting
8130344 women may look at what happened to hillary clinton and think absolutely not i am not going to put myself through that
8130345 but on the other hand i think back to how far women have come in terms of progress when my grandmother was born women couldnt vote and clinton had a very viable campaign and she almost won and by some accounts she actually did win there are now more women governors than ever before and those jobs can be springboards to making a run for the president
8130346 the next hillary clintons are out there strong progressive women who are working hard and looking to get elected
8130347 and for me being a young woman its incredibly inspirational for me to have someone like hillary clinton to look up to in the political process shes motivated so many of us and the sexist treatment of her by the media from where im coming from gave us all the more reason to fight
8130348 i think unfortunately for women that the presidency is viewed as a very masculine office because of its links to the military the fact that the president is the commander in chief its hard for some people to conceptualize a woman being in that position
8130349 there are still so many obstacles that have everything to do with gender there are those who still believe that they feel more comfortable with men in power even other women
8130350 after this it wont be so odd or weird for a woman to be such an exciting viable candidate for president
8130351 promote a structure in which kids can make a real connections with one another

8130357 my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8130358 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8130359 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8130360 more economic stagnation and less affordable health care more high gas prices and less alternative energy more jobs getting shipped overseas and fewer jobs created here more war less diplomacy

8130371 why wont she let us have an up or down vote
8130372 hey this is a member of congress youre speaking to have a little respect
8130373 you dont think years of being a state legislator counts for anything
8130374 you do know that barack obama has the same amount of experience as did abraham lincoln right
8130375 ok so what do you think about this latest brou ha ha about john mccains 7 8 9 houses
8130376 ha ha i wish i could do well enough to have that many houses its not wrong to make money
8130377 i remember four years ago that the republicans made a huge fuss over theresa heinz kerrys money how kerry married into her fortune and so on what do you think about mccain marrying into cindys money
8130378 if i understand your point sir you are upset that women have the right to in your opinion murder an innocent baby in the womb
8130379 so you believe that the picture of that naked aborted fetus youre holding has all the same rights as a living breathing baby
8130380 so essentially by your definitions you are standing out on a city street in a public place with a five foot poster of child porn right
8130381 yes it is an obscenity an obscenity that we murder so many millions of innocent babies
8130382 but you want to get that point across by showing public child porn
8130383 i want to bring the democratic party back to defending life if we cant even have a dialogue about the issue thats pretty sad this is a crime we need to talk about crimes why cant we talk about this rape is a crime you dont say we cant talk about rape murder is a crime you dont say we cant talk about murder
8130384 yes but youre not standing on a corner with a five foot graphic poster of a rape in progress of the bloody victim of a murder
8130385 excuse me maam ive watched a lot of porn ive even seen some porn that i didnt think was physically possible but ive never even heard of bird porn whats the deal
8130386 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
8130387 johns certainly got not only a strong background in government process hes been dealing with politics in various senses for quite a period of time
8130388 im not prepared to comment on that other than to say that nsw police crime scene investigators will prepare a report for the coroner
8130389 the scepticism appears to be driven in part by a sense that the big issues are bigger than any individual government they are global issues they lie in the hands of multinational corporations global institutions
8130390 this is the governments problem and they have to fix it by changing the medicare levy surcharge cut in rate
8130391 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8130392 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8130393 insulted the most courageous pro life democrat in the land who asked that those who believed in the right to life be accorded the right to speak
8130394 we cannot say we are against abortion and then let our children suffer in broken schools
8130395 at the same time we are cutting support for medicaid head start or the women infants and childrens program
8130396 it was a lousy night we pretty much screwed it up every way you can screw it up theres absolutely no excuse

8130401 our guys battled kept coming back but it wasnt easy
8130402 it really wasnt one of our better games but its in the win column and give these guys credit for really staying after it
8130403 i dont know what happened but maybe i have to have more concentration so it doesnt happen again
8130404 we did some things offensively but obviously we didnt pitch very well
8130405 but this team is leaving everything it has on the field we got rid of some good players and its hurt us but people need to get over that

8130423 americans recognize that neither john mccain nor barack obama are agents of change in this country
8130424 senators mccain and obama are the remnants of a political establishment that has failed the american people and will continue to do so as long as voters give them a chance its time to send them a message a message that says we will not tolerate another four years of business as usual in washington
8130425 liberals who are tired of the democratic party acting as a doormat to the governments assault against civil liberties
8130426 and conservatives who are tired of the republican partys reckless abandonment of fiscal responsibility are all potential barr voters as more voters realize that neither obama nor mccain are candidates truly dedicated to reversing these trends you can expect to see my numbers climb steadily higher
8130427 it used to be the first question was how long has it been on the market
8130428 recently there hasnt been as much of an urgency for buyers to do something
8130429 a lot of people are saying we want to wait until winter when we can get the best deal
8130430 were seeing a lot of people that bought within the last two years when money was cheap so to break even theyre maintaining a high listing price its only worth what im going to pay for it
8130431 if a house had already been reduced several times my thought before i would walk in was can i get the house for less than its listed right now
8130432 you see far more price reductions than you ever saw before
8130433 every individual seller has to make the decision how long do i want to have my home on the market
8130434 i expect to pass through this world but once any good thing therefore that i can do or any kindness that i can show to any fellow creature let me do it now let me not defer or neglect it for i shall not pass this way again stephan grellet

8130436 sometimes we depend on other people as a mirror to define us and tell us who we are and each reflection makes me like myself a little more
8130437 theres something delicious about writing the first words of a story you can never quite tell where theyll take you mine took me here where i belong
8130438 its extremely frustrating i hate it i didnt get it done i didnt get it done tonight i wish i could say i felt terrible but i felt pretty decent i got out of synch in the first inning and walked a couple of guys but after that i felt that i was able to throw my all pitches pretty much where i wanted to i couldnt get anybody out though
8130439 i had two outs and was hoping to have a 1 2 3 inning and then the inning turned into a horrible inning just frustrating i felt like it was a pretty good pitch on the outside corner to bay i think he got into a count 2 2 where i had to throw a little bit more over the plate than i wanted to out there i thought i threw a good back door curveball to the next kid jed lowrie and he hit it ground ball single in between second and third and then again i thought i threw a good changeup in a good count 1 2 to jeff bailey and he just rolled it right down the line on the bag its frustrating i gave up those three runs early i broke out my changeup in the fourth and i was throwing it for strikes when i wanted to it was a game where i thought that as soon as i started throwing that for strikes the way i was the way i was locating my fastball it was a game i could carry into the seventh inning or so and hold them to three right there but obviously it didnt work out like that i just i didnt get the job done
8130440 it was an awful night for me personally it was a long night pretty much screwed it up anyway you can screw it up my team expects me to get big hits and make plays and tonight i didnt do that johnny jeet and bobby worked great at bats all night combined 6 for 11 with two walks and i just killed the rally no ones more frustrated than me everyones desperate for wins a night like tonight i was booing myself weve always said you want to get a good pitch to hit and put an a swing on that double play in the seventh it wasnt a good pitch to hit and it wasnt an a swing today we sucked i sucked i played terrible and they hit balls all over the place down at the corner at third base and i left men all over the field tonight you can put it on me
8130441 alex is out there busting his butt he still works harder than all of us in here he had that off night and thats unfortunate this was a night when we needed to get something and unfortunately we couldnt get anything from him he expects to be the greatest player ever and unfortunately on a day by day basis that doesnt really translate at times its tough to be the best player on the field every single day he expects to be and unfortunately tonight he wasnt

8130468 with wind conditions like this especially if its been dry and warm were always concerned it takes some of the predictability away and its just a struggle for fire fighters to get a handle on it
8130469 you never know until things die down and fire fighters can get in and see just whats going on
8130470 things were looking pretty good at least everything except for the south east side
8130471 we need to be careful of what were doing whether were driving in grass or mufflers that can start fires or camp fires just anything that can create a spark
8130472 academics comes first but football is still an important part of my life
8130473 this is my 15th season playing football its something ive always loved to do
8130474 i wanted to try division i at pitt because i didnt want to look back and say i passed up an experience at that level
8130475 its easier to get work done during the season than out of season because i cant procrastinate i have to budget my time
8130476 i like to think i motivate myself and when it comes down to it you have to do it football is really good at relieving stress and that can help in other areas of my life
8130477 i bring a book with me on the bus and you can take tests early as long as you make plans in advance
8130478 schooling is definitely more important than football but id love to give football a shot after i graduate if theres an opportunity

8130481 i like to think im doing the hitting at both positions
8130482 ive had success at both positions and feel comfortable at both positions
8130483 ive noticed these recruits definitely you can tell theyre a different caliber athlete
8130484 we are very pleased with both guys its a matter of one of them stepping up and taking control of the team

8130509 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security
8130510 we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available

8130512 even adults with insurance reported problems in getting needed care
8130513 even in 2007 when the economic slow down hadnt really taken hold you found that 29 percent of those with medical bill problems or accrued medical debt reported being unable to pay for basic necessities like food heat rent

8130529 determining the probable collapse sequence for wtc 7 nist found that the impact of debris from the collapse of wtc 1 ignited fires on at least 10 floors of wtc 7 and the fires burned out of control on six lower floors
8130530 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
8130531 what followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures
8130532 in order for the thermate reaction to melt steel to take place there has to be materials if you look at the amount needed at least 100 pounds for one column you need someone to get that amount in the building and place it and for the reaction to take place it is unlikely
8130533 substantial evidence that aluminothermic thermite materials were present at the wtc jones 2007 and the presense of such materials can explain the existence of intense fire where it would not otherwise have existed
8130534 regardless of how thermite materials were installed in the wtc it is strange that nist has been so blind to any such possibility in fact when reading nists reports on the wtc and its periodic responses to faqs from the public one might get the idea that no one in the nist organization had ever heard of nano thermites before but the truth is many of the scientists and organizations involved in the nist wtc investigation were not only well aware of nano thermites they actually had considerable connection to and some cases expertise in this exact technology
8130535 and we will look at what you have to say
8130536 we asked ourselves what is the minimum amount of charge we could use to bring the building down and we found that even the smallest charge would release an extremely loud sound heard half a mile away there were no reports of such a sound numerous observers and video recordings found the collapse to be relatively quiet
8130537 yeah i was just standing there ya know we were watching the building wtc 7 actually cuz it was on fire the bottom floors of the building were on fire and we heard this sound that sounded like a clap of thunder turned around we were shocked to see that the building was ah well it looked like there was a shockwave ripping through the building and the windows all busted out it was horrifying about a second later the bottom floor caved out and the building followed after that we saw the building crash down all the way to the ground we were in shock

8130561 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8130562 if the parties constrain the arbitrators authority by requiring a dispute to be decided according to the rule of law and make plain their intention that the award is reviewable for legal error the general rule of limited review has been displaced by the parties agreement
8130563 the arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error
8130564 t he judicial system reaps little benefit from forcing parties to choose between the risk of an erroneous arbitration award and the burden of litigating their dispute entirely in court enforcing contract provisions for review of awards on the merits relieves pressure on congested trial court dockets
8130565 incorporating traditional judicial review by express agreement preserves the utility of arbitration as a way to obtain expert factual determinations without delay while allowing the parties to protect themselves from perhaps the weakest aspect of the arbitral process its handling of disputed rules of law
8130566 this is continued evidence that the initiatives and programs to protect workers safety and health designed by and implemented in this administration are indeed working in addition to a decline in the overall number of fatalities the rate for 2007 declined to 3 7 fatalities per 100 000 workers this is the lowest fatality rate in recorded osha history

8130568 while he was in prison he was surrounded by fear all the time any human being living in such a condition will of course suffer from the effects of continuous fear but that is all history
8130569 terrorism in whatever form is not accepted by kazakhstan we condemn it in the strongest possible terms there is no justification for it we have supported all anti terrorism initiatives be it by the united states or any other country kazakhstans support for such initiatives can be assessed by the fact that this country krygistan allowed the u s to use its airspace to reach afghanistan to tackle the taliban and al qaeda immediately after 9 11 kazakhstan also has an arrangement with the nato to provide humanitarian aid this is a very important part of our ties with the u s there are other areas also where we collaborate such as border management immigration processes and combating drug trafficking
8130570 we would like to diversify our contacts in the field of security we have a small military unit whose responsibility is to help kazakhstans partners in their time of need we are proud of this partnership
8130571 india is making a very important contribution for the development of our forum it is one of the biggest and the most influential countries of the world and having it onboard is very important
8130572 action plans have been submitted by various member states they relate to human dimensions the fight against terrorism and transnational crimes non security challenges like drug trafficking cica has a heterogeneous membership and this is an asset when you have a homogeneous forum you can decide on important issues but on the other hand the fact is that we have different countries different cultures we are dealing with different confidence building measures and this is the backbone of our institution
8130573 trust and confidence needs time to build and each member country has been assigned specific areas based on its competence and past record in that particular sphere
8130574 we dont want to duplicate other regional entities the intellectual capability of our forum has to be seen to be different we are at a stage where we are developing mechanisms and action plans where they will lead i dont know we are looking to build trust and promote common interaction among member states as far as time lines are concerned my view is that the experiences one forum cannot be used in anothers context
8130575 goodwill and collective security we can think of conditions for releasing a more prosperous and unique region
8130576 the company needs to get serious about these issues or they are going to have a work stoppage on their hands

8130582 georgia didnt have control of these territories and now its even more unlikely that it will ever be able to reintegrate them if georgia tried it would probably escalate into military conflict again
8130583 the western choice is an historic and natural choice of the georgian people nothing can change this choice
8130584 georgia has been trying for a very long time to tell the world what has been going on they kept saying the russians were taking up new positions and putting new elements into play but people said they were exaggerating

8130615 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8130616 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end
8130617 on one occasion the accused offered him a lucrative share deal in the uk if he didnt tell anybody
8130618 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8130619 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8130620 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8130621 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8130622 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off

8130644 there is no reason why we should expect things to be otherwise because the things of everyday experience involve large numbers of particles or involve things moving very slowly or involve other conditions that are special and represent in fact a limited experience with nature it is a small section only of natural phenomena that one gets from direct experience it is only through refined measurements and careful experimentation that we can have a wider vision and then we see unexpected things we see things that are far from what we would guess far from what we could have imagined our imagination is stretched to the utmost not as in fiction to imagine things which are not really there but just to comprehend those things which are there it will be difficult but the difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself but how can it be like that which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar i will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar i will simply describe it on the other hand i think i can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics so do not take the lecture too seriously feeling that you really have to understand in terms of some model what i am going to describe but just relay and enjoy it i am going to tell you what nature behaves like if you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this you will find her a delightful entrancing thing do not keep saying to yourself if you can possibly avoid it but how can it be like that because you will get down the drain into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped nobody knows how it can be like that
8130645 the competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull he therefore approaches his task with full humility and avoids clever tricks like the plague
8130646 we built our homes out of palm leaves i saw animals id never seen before he taught me the medicinal properties of all the plants we picked fruit off the trees we swam with and ate piranhas and of course we had sex for almost two weeks
8130647 i got to stay in the jungle and he got to have sex with a cute young american girl
8130648 its more about getting what you want than getting what you need
8130649 unless you think everyone needs a 200 louis vuitton bag
8130650 women are turned on just by the simple idea of their guy getting off his ass and doing something for them
8130651 give it to me first thing in the morning and ill play handyman all day
8130652 theyll touch my hand and theres all this physical contact or theyll run around in their pajamas
8130653 i was painting the hallway right outside a clients bedroom and she was lying on her bed like a girl at a slumber party with her legs up and her arms crossed and her head resting on them asking me if i had a girlfriend
8130654 its all about the fantasy of being taken by the rough hewn construction guy
8130655 i dont get anybody in my office who says my husband sits on the couch all day and eats bonbons and i want to have sex with him all the time
8130656 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8130657 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8130658 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8130659 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8130660 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8130661 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8130662 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8130663 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8130664 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8130665 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8130666 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8130667 you also have to find some patriotic sunglasses and a religious picture that lights up

8130673 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensics and ordinary old police detective work
8130674 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometimes it could even be the wrong house
8130675 you shoot into a house you never know where the bullets are going to go i believe he was in bed
8130676 the employee stepped in tired to intervene the suspect and the employee begin fighting the suspect pulls out a gun and shoots the employee on the parking lot one time
8130677 our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family this act of heroism is something we try not to encourage for all the obvious reasons now but im sure he was just trying to help is all we can ascertain at this particular point
8130678 right now it appears the employee was being a good samaritan and step in and assist the lady who was being assaulted by this male
8130679 meanwhile canon keeps you as a customer and your broken junk heap gets recycled properly that loyalty program sure would earn mine

8130681 you have to try the francis conner try the francis conner
8130682 i remember walking off of the court knowing there was no way i could have beaten him on that day he played a nearly flawless match in every facet
8130683 lifting the trophy after beating courier was the best match of my life
8130684 i had many a fierce battle with stefan inside the lines and i consider him one of the all time gentlemen of our sport our match ups were interesting ones as we had contrasting styles he knew what i was going to do and vice versa and it was simply a matter of who executed better on the day as to who won
8130685 thinking back i was lucky to play in this era of great players
8130686 wherever they play they reach the final and theyve had an incredible run
8130687 they have very few letdowns and ive never seen anything else like that there hasnt been two guys dominating the game the way theyve had as much as theyve done this rivalry is great for tennis and the quality of matches are extremely high level now you need a new name or two like novak djokovic and it would be nice to see some new faces coming up
8130688 what an incredible record to stay at the number one position for 237 weeks to one of the best players ever playing the game
8130689 nadal is a great player with incredible charisma and fighting spirit and he deserves the no 1 ranking especially after winning one of the greatest wimbledon finals ever following the french open win
8130690 that was by far the most difficult slam tournament in my career
8130691 i beat chang in a marathon and then had to come back the next day to play sampras
8130692 you have some bigger servers today but they dont follow up going to the net with boris and goran ivanisevic you wouldnt get any rhythm and if you dropped your serve it was extremely difficult to come back and win the set
8130693 being a serve and volleyer myself it would be nice to have one two or three the guys are playing good effective tennis today but it would be nice to have variation of styles i played chang and he would stay back you look at borg and mcenroe and they had different styles that would be the only thing i wish to see variation
8130694 tennis is in pretty good shape right now and federer nadal have played some quality tennis matches its also nice to see novak djokovic playing well and up there
8130695 wow that burrito was soooo tasty much better than the first time i ate here
8130696 well give you the catchy single and then youll buy 11 additional tracks of boring mundane not ready for primetime rock
8130697 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
8130698 many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
8130699 if you are using a shared pc a borrowed laptop from a friend or a public pc sometimes you dont want other people to know where youve been
8130700 you know as well as i do this feature is built for porn
8130701 to lock everyone into aporn bucket makes people who have alternate privacy needs think that theyre doing something wrong
8130702 we want users to not only be able to enter a private browsing session but tell the browser that they want to delete all evidence starting a couple of hours ago
8130703 the key part is getting privacy tools into the browser
8130704 rather than as add ons or extensions microsofts announcement is significant not because its a major technological breakthrough but because its a breakthrough into making it easier for users to have real control over their privacy
8130705 but well have to wait to see how easy it is to use
8130706 what were seeing in firefox is that people want their browsers to remember more not less
8130707 have been financed by islamic charities of the iranian regime based in california and by the silicon iran network
8130708 in exchange the senator does his best to aid the mullahs
8130709 i believe than an improved relationship with iran is in the naked self interest of the united states of america
8130710 biden has been too cozy with the supporters of the iranian regime which is anti american anti iranian and has a horrendous human rights record
8130711 iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the u s
8130712 as iranian americans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism
8130713 highlights the need to really investigate the web of iranian influence in the united states
8130714 what you have here is a group of people who have been working together through different groups and organizations for the past ten years
8130715 its deeply troubling to have a vice presidential candidate raise funds from people whose ties to the iranian regime raise such serious questions
8130716 i suspect there may be an avaricious motive behind bidens pro iranian position and i think it has something to do with the color green

8130723 its used in other sports so i dont know why baseball was opposed to it yes weve dealt with the human element for a long time in baseball but there have been a lot of bad calls over the years that im sure the umpires didnt go home and sleep well after seeing it on replay ive lost a couple of home runs over the years that were called foul but i just think its always right to make the right call for all parties
8130724 im an old school guy and i still feel that its the umpires call to make whether its the right one or the wrong one the human element is what makes baseball so great and so much fun because with the naked eye you can either make it right or make it wrong

8130774 i will vote for hillary at the convention because hillary has earned my vote
8130775 i am the voice of those voters and those voters will not be silenced
8130776 after the convention im supposed to represent the democratic party a democrat has to be in office
8130777 i made a commitment to her and i intend to honor that commitment
8130778 maybe its just hoping all the experts are saying its a foregone conclusion but if you dont hold onto that little bit of hope then your spirit dies
8130779 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8130780 open to the mccain message and not yet sold on obama
8130781 this pitch will get more explicit as the campaign goes on
8130782 if democrats are telling us hes not ready to be president of the united states we better listen
8130783 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8130784 im here to make a few points for the good side

8130796 were not particularly interested in iburst itself which is losing its place in the market and is dying under the weight of 3 5g products that the large telcos are running

8130852 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8130853 hes a charming guy hes a celebrity but does he have the judgment and experience that comes from a life long service in one sector or another
8130854 the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win wouldve been to pick hillary clinton
8130855 it is a no brainer she got 18 million votes joe got 9 000 votes
8130856 thats what the choice for a president comes down to it doesnt come down to a choice between the abstract and the abstract it comes down to a choice between two people
8130857 you cant avoid that comparison youve got one candidate with a lot of experience and one with virtually no experience
8130858 i cant imagine anybody who is ready to debate joe biden
8130859 im not sure when john mccain will make his vice president announcement or who itll be

8130879 to discuss sacred scriptures according to the plain meaning of the historical facts not according to future events which they foreshadow
8130880 it is a laborious and difficult task for the powers of our human understanding to see clearly the meaning of the sacred writer in the matter of these six days
8130881 in matters that are obscure and far beyond our vision we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position we too fall with it that would be to battle not for the teaching of holy scripture but for our own wishing its teaching to conform to ours whereas we ought to wish ours to conform to that of sacred scripture
8130882 one must surely not think that in this passage of holy scripture there has been an omission of any one of the four elements that are generally supposed to make up the world just because there seems to be no mention of air in the account of sky water and earth
8130883 the sacred writer was able to separate in the time of his narrative what god did not separate in time in his creative act
8130884 these seven days of our time although like the same days of creation in name and in numbering follow one another in succession and mark off the division of time but those first six days occurred in a form unfamiliar to us as intrinsic principles within things created
8130885 are beyond the experience and knowledge of us mortal earthbound men we must bear in mind that these days indeed recall the days of creation but without in any way being really similar to them
8130886 we should not think of those days as solar days he made that which gave time its beginning as he made all things together disposing them in an order based not on intervals of time but on causal connections
8130887 but in the beginning he created all things together and completed the whole in six days when six times he brought the day which he made before the things which he made not in a succession of periods of time but in a plan made known according to causes
8130888 the reason is that those who cannot understand the meaning of the text he created all things together cannot arrive at the meaning of scripture unless the narrative proceeds slowly step by step
8130889 that day which god has made recurs in connection with his works not by a material passage of time but by a spiritual knowledge when the blessed company of angels contemplate from the beginning in the word of god the divine decree to create
8130890 the seven days with which we are familiar are like a shadow and a sign reminding us to seek those days wherein created spiritual light was able to be made present to all the works of god by the perfection of the number six
8130891 and when you hear that all things were made after day was made you may possibly understand this sixfold or sevenfold repetition which took place without lapse of time if you cannot yet understand it you should leave the matter for the consideration of those who can
8130892 for he has wrought them all in his wisdom which reaching from end to end governs all graciously and he leaves not in an unformed state the very least of his creatures that are by their nature subject to corruption whose dissolution is loathsome to us in our fallen state by reason of our own mortality
8130893 it is difficult to explain how man was created immortal and at the same time in company with the other living creatures was given for food the seed bearing plant the fruit tree and the green crops if it was by sin that he was made mortal surely before sinning he did not need such food since his body could not corrupt for lack of it

8130961 i think hes going to be very important to our state and the message that he is sending about the kind of change he wants to bring nationally is the kind of change weve made happen in our home state
8130962 it builds up momentum for us and for him and sends a clear message about the values that are at stake here

8131004 the modern pentathlon is all the skills required by a cavalry officer to escape from enemy territory unless that enemy territory was a french gentlemens club i cant see the need for the ability to cut a cigar or quaff a brandy
8131005 my wife has who completed in the modern pentathlon has informed me that it came about as a way of developing all the skills required in a calvary officer ride a horse run across a field swim a river shoot a pistol and fight a duel so there would be a strong case for including cigar cutting and brandy quaffing but dont tell her i said that

8131016 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8131017 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8131018 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8131019 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8131020 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8131021 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8131022 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8131023 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8131024 and in 2008 he mccain still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8131025 john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it a part of americas future for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8131026 after eight years of a white house waiting hand and foot on big oil john mccain offers more of the same at a time of skyrocketing fuel prices when american families are struggling to keep their gas tanks full john mccain voted 25 times against renewable and alternative energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind energy
8131027 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush
8131028 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8131029 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8131030 at a time when america should be working harder than ever to develop new clean sources john mccain wants more of the same and has taken more than a million dollars in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry now he wants to give the oil companies another 4 billion in tax breaks four billion in tax breaks for big oil
8131031 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8131032 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8131033 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8131034 i saw some of my colleagues standing up and applauding for obama for the first time
8131035 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8131036 im not in any way trying to promote my qualifications or to dissuade others of my disqualifications to serve on a mccain ticket
8131037 wont make a lick of difference to struggling american families
8131038 he does better on television for me than he did for himself
8131039 i dont have anything to tell you about senator mccains vice presidential selection process
8131040 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8131041 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8131042 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8131043 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8131044 less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged comes first and everyone else come last
8131045 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8131046 my hope is that if everyone will take an extra minute or two and just look a quarter mile around their house and just look for him and if everybody did that im sure we would find him

8131126 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8131127 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8131128 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8131129 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off

8131142 medulloblastoma is a highly malignant primary brain tumor that originates in the cerebellum or posterior fossa
8131143 while the grave prognosis associated with medulloblastoma is fully justified it appears that some hope can be given to parents of children with this disease since practically 40 per cent of our cases completing treatment have survived 5 years and 30 per cent 10 years

8131179 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him
8131180 at that time he was surrounded by fear all the time any human being living in such a condition will of course suffer from the effects of continuous fear but that is all history
8131181 in fact many people were very impressed to see mr zardari go through the trauma of the assassination of benazir bhutto but still hold himself together hold his family especially his children close to him at this very difficult time
8131182 the difference between being a good team and a great team is being content with a win today and coming out flat tomorrow or coming out tomorrow and doing everything we can to get that victory
8131183 the great teams find a way to come out and really send a message and win that game tomorrow
8131184 i am here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama

8131187 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8131188 with an agenda like that it makes perfect sense that john mccain and george bush will be together in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8131189 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8131190 were you in this campaign just for me were you in it for all the people who feel invisible
8131191 there is no chasm too deep no barrier too great and no ceiling too high for all who work hard who keep going have faith in god in our country and in each other
8131192 that is our mission as democrats to elect barack obama
8131193 id love to see a woman president but the party will survive
8131194 ive been meeting with a lot of the clinton supporters and they are dealing with this its not easy but they get it
8131195 we felt women were being shoved around told to go away and be quiet its over and done
8131196 is not going to go away her greatest work is still ahead of her
8131197 weve got to make sure the job is done that john mccain is not elected in the fall we have to move on this is a fact of life now
8131198 barack obama got a special deal from a convicted felon
8131199 i think it was a strange thing for barack obama to seize upon
8131200 if homes is going to be the topic of discussion that barack obama is going to end up on the short end of that one
8131201 according to the villagers their enemies give false report to americans that foreign fighters were gathering in the village

8131208 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
8131209 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
8131210 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
8131211 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower

8131231 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal healthcare helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfils the hopes of our people

8131265 many are online nearly half of current college students told us that the future of activism is digital but nearly two thirds also said the future is on campus flesh and blood action is far from an anachronism but its becoming unthinkable without social networking tools
8131266 now is not the time to discuss the referees injuries absences
8131267 this is not the time to speak of officiating but i think with the fiba rules we would have won that is why we are a little annoyed because we were right there at the finish line and we have just missed out
8131268 the pilot relayed to the airport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8131269 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8131270 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had co ordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8131271 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8131272 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8131273 we had three senior members on the plane and some other people they got on and someone hijacked it
8131274 about half an hour after takeoff a hijacker demanded to go to cairo as a destination
8131275 its used in other sports so i dont know why baseball was opposed to it yes weve dealt with the human element for a long time in baseball but there have been a lot of bad calls over the years that im sure the umpires didnt go home and sleep well after seeing it on replay ive lost a couple of home runs over the years that were called foul but i just think its always right to make the right call for all parties
8131276 im an old school guy and i still feel that its the umpires call to make whether its the right one or the wrong one the human element is what makes baseball so great and so much fun because with the naked eye you can either make it right or make it wrong
8131277 are you not much more valuable than they who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life

8131282 really all three of us have come out and competed hard and made plays i think thats made the decision tough i think a lot of teams in the pac 10 would like a quarterback situation like we have
8131283 from friday to monday he recovered a lot but from yesterday to today hes about where he was monday youre kind of hoping he makes that jump but he didnt
8131284 weve moved forward him coming back wouldve been a bonus wed already moved forward as if jarod was going to be the quarterback
8131285 we have much work to do to enable more people to feel safe taking their bike to work

8131292 acest act unilateral regretabil si lipsit de temei legal este susceptibil sa afecteze si mai puternic situatia din zona precum si perspectivele de reglementare durabila a conflictelor din regiune
8131293 vom face tot ce putem pentru a evita un nou razboi rece dar in aceasta situatie mingea este in terenul europenilor
8131294 daca doresc deteriorarea relatiilor sigur ca o vor obtine dar daca doresc salvarea relatiilor noastre strategice ceea ce este in interesul rusiei si europei totul va fi bine
8131295 they competed theyve both done well theyre both good players they both give you the things to win football games
8131296 for the overall long term good of the program this is a good thing
8131297 theyve had a nice quiet sane period of time to do what theyre supposed to do work on their game
8131298 not become this team spokesman wittingly or unwittingly and now in particular with the student body back and 20 000 people available to all have their comment as to who should be the starting quarterback
8131299 its really been very low key on our end it hasnt been nearly as dramatic a decision for us as choosing a vice president
8131300 what weve wanted to do was create a circumstance of sanity where the players could just be three other players working on the game just as other players are and particularly because none of them have ever been the starter before and not handle all those circumstances on top of becoming proficient in the offense
8131301 theyre the stamp of college football the elite of the class
8131302 playing against them you see where you really stand comparing yourself to the mark the opportunity to play such a great team and the competition and excitement that surrounds the game it makes it all that much more elevated
8131303 unless someone tells me differently id put pueblo south up there again
8131304 pueblo south and sierra seem to be the two teams to beat early on this may be sierras year to challenge
8131305 our qb is amazing our running backs are going to be great were really going to expect some big things from the guys up front
8131306 hopefully we just get our coaching staff to put them in the right situation and get out of the way
8131307 i feel like our offensive line will be pretty solid
8131308 our offense will probably be a little bit ahead of defense to start the year
8131309 i feel happy that the strahans were able to resolve their difference and focus on their children
8131310 this is what we in the industry call a no brainer
8131311 saakashvili chose genocide to solve his political tasks the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referendums supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
8131312 were not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war he said
8131313 of course we dont need that everything depends on the stance of our partners and the world community
8131314 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8131315 we again call on russia to abide by international law as the basis for resolving this crisis and to implement urgently and in full russias commitments to withdraw forces
8131316 the olympic gold in doubles gave me a great lift
8131317 it really inspired me and i hope to use that to do well here
8131318 it is a special memory it was unbelievable to listen to the national anthem and share that moment with my friend
8131319 i dont have words i am just honoured its going to be a crazy year
8131320 if somebody says something nasty about you it makes you upset
8131321 but ive said that its not representative of anybody and the support ive got it makes you proud to be irish
8131322 i am honoured to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8131323 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8131324 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8131325 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8131326 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single american
8131327 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatise social security and in 2008 he still thinks it is okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8131328 many of those brought to us suffered nose and ear pain as the pressure in the cabin was lost
8131329 the ear injuries were then aggravated by the swift loss of altitude those brought to us had severe headaches nosebleeds and damaged eardrums
8131330 most were also suffering from shock but thankfully they are all expected to make a full recovery
8131331 suddenly there was a roar of wind a rush of cold air the oxygen masks dropped you didnt know what was going on
8131332 you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft
8131333 it was incredibly cold my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
8131334 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8131335 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
8131336 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8131337 i was surprised there seemed to be no communication between the pilot and the flight attendants because they didnt seem to know what to say and do
8131338 there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear
8131339 thumping noise then a rush of very cold air through the cabin people began shouting out in fear
8131340 when something like that happens people obviously think they are going to die
8131341 everyone began reaching for their masks babies started crying people clung on to each other some were being sick it was a truly frightening moment
8131342 passengers sometimes misunderstand they expect a surge of oxygen when in actual fact there is a steady stream of oxygen
8131343 the oxygen masks were working and the correct procedures were followed as soon as the captain got the plane down to 8 000ft he did make the appropriate announcement that they were going to divert to limoges for safety reasons
8131344 this is always a traumatic experience for passengers but the crew dealt with it appropriately
8131345 he wonders how we can encourage our young people to become active in politics when the national broadcaster refers to the as biffo
8131346 tone and context were such that its usage could not determine unfairness and partiality
8131347 the presentation was factual and professional with no evidence of intent to cause offence and or to be disrespectful
8131348 a tribute to the healing and reflective power of the written word note to self demonstrates that sometimes being completely honest with yourself is the most dangerous and rewarding pursuit of all
8131349 cant wait until next week for the shield and sons of anarchy love love love the shield i am vic mackeys bitch
8131350 i had a beer and some nachos with voostru today at someday lounge and it was wonderful even though i was stressed and tired thanks
8131351 time to ride the bike home on this glorious summer afternoon
8131352 i could take this rainy overcast weather for a few more days nice and cool for a change
8131353 right now id say were all pretty much the same level
8131354 weve got two good d linemen returning beau kelly and jaden terry thats a pretty dangerous tandem
8131355 theyre throwing and catching well andre is going to be really really good
8131356 we went with the approach that the best 11 will be on defense first
8131357 nathan retires as a life member of our club since commencing in 1998 he has grown enormously in terms of his leadership and the contribution he has made to the culture of our playing group especially in recent years has been very significant
8131358 well always remember the animated bass responses the selfless acts of courage and the long runs out of defence which were trademarks of his 11 years as a player
8131359 comreg is being frustrated by one provider just because its in a position to do so
8131360 there are other players out there ready to roll up their sleeves and get competitive and this is just another stumbling block for them
8131361 eircom has once again shown that it will use any and all means to protect its monopoly position in the market
8131362 well race him like that in the chase if thats what he wants
8131363 but let me make one thing clear im not apologizing for it and thats the way it is
8131364 but remarks from harvick and hornaday are what theyre going to be theyre big mouths anyway and so well take it and get on with it and hopefully beat them out for this championship
8131365 do you think im not a good feminist because i stayed home with you kids
8131366 do you think that im condemning your choices if i dont make the same ones
8131367 is that i wonder if your father had to work too hard since he was the only person bringing in an income i think he might have liked to have had more time with you kids
8131368 do the best you can but if something goes wrong it all rests on you good luck
8131369 could i run away fast enough if that helicopter suddenly stopped helicoptering and fell on my camper
8131370 well shes certainly telling friends shes planning to write a book
8131371 its supposed to be about her allegedly but come on you know lindsay will be all over that book shes the only one people want to read about
8131372 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8131373 that decrepit old has been i guess never was been is more appropriate
8131374 you know what if you dont start busting butt youre not going to have an opportunity to drive in this series much longer
8131375 insert a team organization here provides chassis and engines to insert b team organization here nothing more
8131376 that doesnt explain why youre always drinking beer even when were not swimming
8131377 oh no why the question is referring to 2 timothy i thought this is on acts 5
8131378 how could a 19 year old middle class urbanized christian relates to a 1st century religious socio political persecution
8131379 oh no how am i going to facilitate this question interestingly and relevantly to these people
8131380 the words of this life is the eternal word of god
8131381 what then was the gospel that the apostles were preaching
8131382 you all talk about the gospel all this while but do you know what is it what is this gospel that keep you coming to church do good loving your neighbours as yourselves
8131383 what is the gospel that you all have been believing in and living by
8131384 the word gospel is not identical with how we understand it today
8131385 in other words whenever you receive the gospel in that time you have to subject to the roman ruler and pay your taxes to them
8131386 and because of that whenever the apostles were preaching the gospel of jesus they were being persecuted for their proclamation is a public subversion to the existing religious and political powers of their time that was why the early christians were being imprisoned flogged and persecuted and all those secondary meaning such as hope salvation etc comes underneath this good news
8131387 that means in the first place the gospel of jesus is not a private religion like the one that we thought it is the gospel is a public subversive declaration of jesus being the authority of the entire world even in todays world
8131388 where can i get a good deal on a new computer
8131389 as chad and i started up chainsawbuffet com as a place to post random humorous articles and crap
8131390 i would say yes as long as it never gets in the way of the show it would be great to see it at the cinema its been there before so it would be good to see it again
8131391 a movie is 90 minutes thats not that different from making a single episode so im not against it
8131392 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
8131393 maybe if the live action star wars tv series goes ahead i might try and wheedle my way back into the affections of lucasfilm and write an episode
8131394 the weird thing and i think this goes for both star trek and doctor who is that neither of them are remakes i often see star trek being referred to as a remake and it really isnt its another star trek film its another movie in the series its the continuing mission
8131395 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it
8131396 both of those are perfect examples of taking the spirit of the original material and entirely maintaining it

8131431 moderators should lead the community by example participating in the discussion and being helpful
8131432 theres a common misconception that moderating comments makes you more liable this is not true
8131433 i think there should be an account login before anyone posts a comment on these sites
8131434 why do you think you can handle commenting on a newspaper website better than those who work for one
8131435 we have tried most of your rules and most dont work
8131436 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8131437 its the destruction of a human life this teaching has not changed and remains unchanged
8131438 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills
8131439 knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them abortion is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8131440 never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8131441 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8131442 were seeing more of that in recent years than perhaps we saw in the past
8131443 when you have very prominent individuals in the public square who are eager to identify themselves as catholics the bishops want to make sure that the people understand that quote unquote celebrities dont get a pass when it comes to the teachings or the practices of the church
8131444 in critically ill adult patients tight glucose control is not associated with significantly reduced hospital mortality but is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia
8131445 overall it seems that the time has come to reconsider whether professional societies should continue to recommend tight glucose control as the standard of care in all critically ill adults
8131446 it has been linked to serious neurologic events ranging from seizures to coma
8131447 only a small number of the trials they use are in patient populations pertinent to ours

8131452 it is difficult to see how the executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal or even that a serious legal question is presented
8131453 so whats it like in london as bad as we hear tons of burkhas
8131454 i dont know i had never seen that there but they tell me youre having big problems and that there are more mosques than churches now in england
8131455 this isnt a religious thing these are just disgruntled disaffected youth this is not about religion weve had situations with different ethnic groups every decade this isnt anything new or any big deal
8131456 well i think no go zones in england where only muslims can enter is pretty terrible for england dont you

8131462 in advance were fifty black warriors armed with slender wooden spears with ends hard baked over slow fires and long bows and poisoned arrows on their backs were oval shields in their noses huge rings while from the kinky wool of their heads protruded tufts of gay feathers
8131463 across their foreheads were tattooed three parallel lines of color and on each breast three concentric circles their yellow teeth were filed to sharp points and their great protruding lips added still further to the low and bestial brutishness of their appearance
8131464 tarzan of the apes looked with growing wonder at these strange creatures dozing in the shade he saw several men while at the extreme outskirts of the clearing he occasionally caught glimpses of armed warriors apparently guarding the village against surprise from an attacking enemy
8131465 he noticed that the women alone worked nowhere was there evidence of a man tilling the fields or performing any of the homely duties of the village
8131466 the young lord greystoke was indeed a strange and war like figure his mass of black hair falling to his shoulders behind and cut with his hunting knife to a rude bang upon his forehead that it might not fall before his eyes
8131467 his straight and perfect figure muscled as the best of the ancient roman gladiators must have been muscled and yet with the soft and sinuous curves of a greek god told at a glance the wondrous combination of enormous strength with suppleness and speed
8131468 il est probable que nous essuierons encore des pertes en afghanistan
8131469 im here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8131470 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8131471 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8131472 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal healthcare helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfils the hopes of our people

8131475 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
8131476 we know there is a severe credit crunch but it is difficult outside the housing market to pin down how much impact it is having on the economy
8131477 while the financial system remained fragile and economic growth was sluggish and could weaken further fisher saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
8131478 if anything i read this as the vast majority preaching patience as far as inflation
8131479 the fed does seem to be signaling their next move is up but to me the odds of even a december hike are still pretty slim

8131496 they dont look at palestinian politics which includes what is aired on the radio taught in school and preached in the mosque all of which makes up public opinion
8131497 what people say in arabic is really what is important
8131498 abu mazen is in many ways relatively moderate but he is not moderate on the palestinian refugees right of return which is very close to his heart

8131516 there are a whole lot of factors that come into play during the application process and the economy is certainly part of it but not the only part
8131517 the whole question of the value proposition of the mba remains strong

8131531 the board did an exceptional job debating the potential ways to present the bond to the voters
8131532 they did just what they were supposed to do and now the decision is in the hands of the voters
8131533 we all agree on the need for the bond election we just had differing opinions on how to present it
8131534 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
8131535 she did a great job i think she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election she was outstanding
8131536 any level of biological organization that we examine from dna up to the most complex body systems shows the capacity for self diagnosis for removal of damaged structure and for regeneration of new structure
8131537 this computer sucks its freaking out and now it says something about being smart let me tell you mister its not smart

8131540 i want a dell uncle ronnie got a dell wheres my dell
8131541 to prosecute individuals who intentionally allow mass copying from their computer over peer to peer networks
8131542 update and reform our copyright and patent systems to promote civic discourse innovation and investment while ensuring that intellectual property owners are fairly treated
8131543 that led me to publish pgp electronically for free that year shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups
8131544 joe biden made his second attempt to introduce such legislation
8131545 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime
8131546 authorize the justice department to pick and choose crimes to investigate and prosecute based on political beliefs and associations
8131547 i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing and the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill
8131548 the democratic partys de facto spokesman on the war against terrorism
8131549 states to place social security numbers on drivers licenses and to obtain fingerprints or some other form of biometric identification for licenses
8131550 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
8131551 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
8131552 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
8131553 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
8131554 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
8131555 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
8131556 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
8131557 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
8131558 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
8131559 we are deeply offended by the gratuitous accusations made against kazaa by witnesses before the committee including ludicrous attempts to associate an extremely beneficial next generation software program with organized criminal gangs and even terrorist organizations
8131560 crimes dangerous to the life limb and well being of minor children
8131561 at least one in person medical evaluation of the patient
8131562 to an individual under the age of 18 years including any such sale using the internet
8131563 ive been looking for luggage tags and the monogrammed one is super cute
8131564 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8131565 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8131566 now with an agenda like that it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8131567 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8131568 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8131569 it started in the loungeroom on one side of the house and it just took the rest of it within two minutes
8131570 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8131571 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8131572 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8131573 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8131574 the worse thing you can have is uncertainty on the home front delivered by an irresponsible party acting for populist reasons in the senate
8131575 identifying offenders where there is a legitimate public interest to be served in doing so
8131576 a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
8131577 for sen bidens iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern day gulf of tonkin resolution equivalent for iraq his committee will need to ask hard questions and demand hard facts concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by iraq
8131578 everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them
8131579 preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove saddam hussein from power regardless of the facts and using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on iraq
8131580 as long as saddams at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out root and branch the entirety of saddams program relative to weapons of mass destruction
8131581 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone
8131582 its going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking saddam down
8131583 one thing is clear these weapons must be dislodged from saddam or saddam must be dislodged from power
8131584 if we wait for the danger from saddam to become clear it could be too late
8131585 he did not snub the un or our allies he did not dismiss a new inspection regime he did not ignore the congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation
8131586 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur
8131587 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
8131588 given the dangerous precedent set by the iraq war resolution naming one of its principal supporters as potentially the next vice president of the united states has raised serious questions regarding obamas commitment to international law this comes at a time when the global community is so desperately hoping for a more responsible u s foreign policy following eight years of bush
8131589 i dont think that this is bad news at all actually the fact weve got 350 000 more jobs than we had when we were elected 1999 to lead the government should be very good news for new zealand
8131590 look this election was historic you had women and you had african american voters and in order to move forward we cant lose a single person we have to go into november with unity
8131591 the asian americans who supported hillary that i know are all going to vote for barack obama
8131592 i feel like shes done all the right things that shes qualified to run for president
8131593 i dont think that her career is over i think at this time at this moment it wasnt hers to take but you can look at history and say that of many people
8131594 its not over for hillary and thats the exciting part for me
8131595 i tell you i was surprised in the beginning in how difficult it was for me to get past the energy and all the spirit you put behind a campaign
8131596 towards the end the campaign learned their lessons but they learned them too late
8131597 as supporters you could see that if there were enough time we could be the nominee being so close it hurts
8131598 i think as a party you could never take for granted any constituency
8131599 its just another credit card college students are going to have trouble paying off
8131600 we can not bump up the price of tuition to differentiate for the credit card fees we were losing but we needed the amount of tuition because its what our budgets are made on
8131601 making us pay the 2 5 percent convenience fee is an unnecessary burden to students
8131602 being one of the two big universities in the state of washington having a weekend over there is a positive presence
8131603 we have a good football opponent so we expect a lot of people to come to the pregame events
8131604 were not just trying to understand we are actually applying the best possible scientific tools and thats where our innovation our advantage comes in
8131605 its wonderful to have this opportunity for the college of liberal arts and jazz northwest to participate in wsu in seattle
8131606 i look forward to meeting people involved in the beginning stages of the multicultural student mentor program
8131607 hes talking he remembers us and he knows where he is
8131608 i have a lot of faith and hope that hell continue to recover
8131609 do not explain the grand nationals personality it doesnt have a good personality exactly it doesnt have a bad personality what it has is a lot of personality and like a person with a lot of personality it can be hard to put your thumb on exactly what the grand national is
8131610 were really trying to encourage people to clean their gear clean their boots in between catchments
8131611 johns certainly got not only a strong background in government process hes been dealing with politics in various senses for quite a period of time
8131612 someone deleted updated some data a while back and we only discovered it now we dont want to restore a backup because that will undo the work from the last week help
8131613 sw user custom pni gui resources base data config xml
8131614 sw user custom custom application resources base data config xml
8131615 its looking good down there but they really really need a drink now
8131616 even towards the coast here everyone needs a drink especially the sandplain country
8131617 looks like the heaviest falls will be around that mid west area actually so you wouldnt rule out under about 15 or 20 millimetres in those areas
8131618 looking for a record that has unset as a value for a non mandatory date or time field
8131619 could not find a record with a blank non mandatory date or time field
8131620 smallworld core spatial technology and fme configuration tips and tricks
8131621 there are many people now in the areas of around maffra and sale and bairnsdale that are now moving into grain production in quite a big way
8131622 in a power outage situation how will affected customers have the power to run their computers to check their outage status online
8131623 yeah thats right youre sitting next to the bathroom for 8 hours and you are forced to watch repeat episodes of
8131624 the preliminary investigations indicate that 3 to 4 kilograms of explosives was used in the bomb
8131625 to me the secret behind becoming successful is very simple i have personally experienced that the care one extends to his or her parents leads to success
8131626 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8131627 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8131628 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8131629 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8131630 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8131631 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8131632 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8131633 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8131634 in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
8131635 because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible
8131636 stop with that damned credit card already now youre killin yourself
8131637 i hope you know that i have found someone else
8131638 if you enter a lively room embedded on your favorite blog or website you can immediately get a sense of the room creators interests just by looking at the furniture and environment they chose

8131643 ultimately concluded that neither the letter itself nor its content was material to the contemplated patent application
8131644 evidence that the applicant 1 made an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact failed to disclose material information or submitted false material information and 2 intended to deceive the pto
8131645 need to strictly enforce the burden of proof and elevated standard of proof in the inequitable conduct context is paramount
8131646 vigilant in not permitting the defense to be applied too lightly
8131647 just as it is inequitable to permit a patentee who obtained his patent through deliberate misrepresentations or omissions of material information to enforce the patent against others it is also inequitable to strike down an entire patent where the patentee only committed minor missteps or acted with minimal culpability or in good faith
8131648 must not only be based on sufficient evidence and be reasonable in light of that evidence but it must also be the single most reasonable inference able to be drawn from the evidence to meet the clear and convincing standard
8131649 to determine whether the severe penalty of unenforceability should be imposed
8131650 a patentee need not offer any good faith explanation unless the accused infringer first carried his burden to prove a threshold level of intent to deceive by clear and convincing evidence
8131651 being a 7 footer wandering around charleston he was very recognizable
8131652 he was extremely down to earth and humble very laid back very appreciative
8131653 he was a gentle giant at almost 7 feet tall but he was very easy going and everyone he met warmed up to him which is why he was so well received
8131654 he was like a son kevin was a very likeable person i think everybody at eastern illinois liked kevin i had bsws tell me how much they liked kevin
8131655 we sent out packets to different media outlets around the country
8131656 duckworth was named by cbs at that time i think the most underrated player in the country cbs actually came to lantz arena and did a spot before the ncaa basketball tournament started
8131657 today is an extremely sad day for the trail blazers family
8131658 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8131659 he did not have too much recent communication with the university since he moved to the west coast
8131660 his number was retired a few years ago and overtime kind of lost touch
8131661 we are deeply saddened by the loss of one of eastern illinois basketball legends
8131662 our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire duckworth family
8131663 i believe that in any kind of decision making process where it is going to impact everybody and parking is surely one of them we need to have open discussions
8131664 we made our recommendations and it is not our job to tell the powers that be how to do it
8131665 we were pretty broad on those because i and the council didnt want to hang anybody up
8131666 this arrangement will allow us opportunities to clear the lot during the day
8131667 again most of the activities will take place in the evenings
8131668 the need around fine arts will be great for both groups
8131669 the increase we had serves a purpose in doudna but we are still understaffed from the level we were prior to the budget cuts
8131670 we have done something here we have never done in the past
8131671 its going to take some tweaking its not perfect right now hopefully well work it out
8131672 the service isnt going to lag but they are not going to get the demand in service
8131673 if you come over someday and you see us over here doudna mopping you are going to know things went south
8131674 when they built this building everything they have done is a challenge for the bsws to keep it clean
8131675 it was not built for the squeamish at heart of cleaning
8131676 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8131677 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
8131678 you represent a really excellent faculty and last year you really showed it
8131679 this is not administrative work this is the heart of the university and i really appreciate it this is shared governance
8131680 for those of you who are not aware doudna is open
8131681 aside from a fire alarm going off at 10 a m its gone smoothly
8131682 i think were going to be pretty close to our target
8131683 the president said last year that we should be at 12 000 students
8131684 i would like to have more communication with university board and the black student union
8131685 i just want to make sure that if we ever needed them they would be there
8131686 basically this is where students meet with senate members and talk about bylaws resolutions and acclimate students to senate life
8131687 we got 90 people signed up at first night and want to work with other registered student organizations to have certain events to increase voter registration this year such as a rock the vote event during constitution week
8131688 i want to have an academic resource booklet out by the end of the year as well with student services and tutoring options in it
8131689 students can have their resources right at their fingertips this way
8131690 firstly i want to push forward one campus one community so students have monthly opportunities to do organized charity work and be more active on campus
8131691 right now it is sort of a chance for leaders executives or representatives of any rso to meet
8131692 we want to push for sort of rso funding which will go towards the needs of these rsos
8131693 so we want to show students that its an expectation that discussions will occur in the classroom
8131694 its a way to bring the students together and show them the academic standards
8131695 we need to see accelerated improvement there just arent enough students meeting state standards
8131696 for the first time we have five years of results on the isat numbers that can legitimately be described as showing a trend the trend is encouraging in mathematics and not so encouraging in reading overall though student performance is flat and we cant be pleased
8131697 reading programs like this are common at many other universities
8131698 an inquiry into the academic expectations resources policies and traditions of university life
8131699 the really big project we did this summer was douglas hall
8131700 i am surprised how much i can recycle with such little effort
8131701 they didnt see much future where they were at apparently at our level we just jump at a guy like that obviously when you take those kinds of guys we expect them to contribute
8131702 this year i didnt think i was going to fit in the system at illinois
8131703 i think i was like a year away from getting the time that i needed
8131704 in the case of mccray interior defensive linemen are hard to come by
8131705 when you recruit you want to recruit inside people so when a guy like that comes open regardless of the circumstances you just have to take the chance
8131706 im anticipating that hes going to be able to maybe do some placekicking or kickoff
8131707 hes got a great leg so im kind of excited about it
8131708 unfortunately for him but fortunately for us they recruited some big time kickers that were highly touted out of high school austin felt like he would have a better opportunity to play here
8131709 hes a big physical kicker when you look at him he looks like a tight end not a kicker
8131710 we were able to put a lot of pressure on them from an attacking standpoint in the first half
8131711 unfortunately they came out in the second half and scored two quick goals and we had to play catch up against a good team thats very difficult to do
8131712 i was just making a run to the near post and the ball went over the goalies head and i was able to deflect it in
8131713 it was their home opener and they were primed to get the win
8131714 theyre a very good team and very well coached we made some mistakes and they were able to capitalize off of them
8131715 ive got people working on the job who are taking care of all the issues that come up
8131716 theyre doing a lot of building around it designing around it holding up this pipe and sliding this one underneath it
8131717 ive been here five years and this will be the first time weve done something like this
8131718 then well turn the corner at ninth and polk which is a really tight corner right now and then well head south on ninth street
8131719 weve still got some work to do in several of the interior spaces and the ceilings in several of these wont be reinstalled until after the hvac contractor is done
8131720 the nice thing about being a rugby walk on is that there are other girls trying to learn the rules of the game and how to play at the same time you are
8131721 i was the only one to show up for the walk on meeting
8131722 it was kind of nerve racking but i had always defined myself as an athlete and was kind of lost without sports
8131723 can you imagine trying to walk on to the soccer team if you had never played soccer before in your life
8131724 it would be nearly impossible because it is too technical and those other sports are so much further along and established that you need to start playing those sports early in order to compete at this high of a level
8131725 she is playing a very skilled position but once she started in january i had her penciled in for that because she is a natural athlete and a quick and tenacious player she is not real big but shes a tough kid
8131726 if we get some injuries maybe ron will have to be activated again
8131727 were still going to be in a two back offense
8131728 were going to be a power team a lot of the time
8131729 this running back group were going to be damn good
8131730 im going to run somebody over before i try to run around them im going to do whatever it is so i can get a yard
8131731 when you add to the mix a guy like chevon walker who because of his speed is a home run hitter so to speak is a big play guy
8131732 norris is going to be wanting to go up the middle
8131733 when it comes to the speed stuff theyll put me or bess in back there opposing defenses wont know who to key on its going to be kind of hectic
8131734 you have a big back type in norris smith and desmin ward
8131735 you have a little bit more of a smaller scat back change direction guys in bess and jordan then with chevon youve got a guy who may have the whole package for you a guy who has good size but also has tremendous speed
8131736 hes probably like 15 20 pounds away from my size hes a strong back he runs very hard hes good i give him another two years and hes going to be great
8131737 keys is a multidimensional guy that will benefit from the use of our formations and personnel groupings
8131738 hes a guy that with his size and strength will be a more than capable blocker for us but will also give us another dimension in our run game with a true big back type of guy
8131739 careful systematic patient study and investigation in some field of knowledge undertaken to discover or establish facts or principles
8131740 great texts is for anyone who wants to think about issues that concern
8131741 i could do this all so much better if i could just get some decent sleep
8131742 barack obama es mi candidato y debe ser el presidente de estados unidos de am rica
8131743 estoy aqu como una orgullosa madre como una orgullosa dem crata y como una orgullosa partidaria de barack obama

8131765 i am not sure that pas is convinced that he can get 30 government mps to cross over
8131766 he may not have the credibility needed to keep the country together
8131767 i think the main contents of his anwars policies are sound and they do make sense economically over the long run because it should have a positive impact on malaysias competitiveness
8131768 but i do question his ability to deliver them when and if he does become prime minister given that the opposition coalition that he leads is comprised of three parties with widely differing agendas and ideologies

8131814 david henry hwang brought things to that libretto that i would never have done which were wonderful they alluded to the movie yet were quite different
8131815 one of the ideas ive had is that there is so much talent in hollywood that could be connected with the world of opera in this season we will be able to have three film directors william friedkin and woody allen directing il trittico and now david cronenberg on the fly its thrilling
8131816 the framework for the fly is steeped in the classic form of opera theres a very contemporary score written specifically for the stage there are little samples in the beginning and end that bridge the gap from the 80s movie

8131818 ill tell you which way the winds blowing now mate
8131819 residential property prices in abu dhabi are expected to continue to rise until at least 2012
8131820 this is due to a supply shortage caused in part by a moratorium on building imposed between 1999 and 2001 which left the emirate with a small housing stock unprepared for the economic boom of the past five years
8131821 on the supply side high global demand and a degree of speculation have driven up construction material costs
8131822 ironically one factor contributing to the rising cost is demand from emirates own building programme the government estimates that projects worth 54 billion dh198bn are currently underway
8131823 despite a 24 per cent increase in domestic steel production last year abu dhabi still imports more than 60 per cent of its needs
8131824 while the policy is intended to protect tenants from unfair rent hikes its efficacy is questionable and according to hsbc bank rents increased some 22 per cent in the first half of this year
8131825 the limitations only apply to those already renting a property so a landlord can increase rents as much as he wishes if a new tenant is moving in furthermore the cap may encourage some landlords to overprice initial rents in the knowledge that their ability to raise prices at market rates thereafter is curtailed
8131826 given the medium term supply outlook profits look set to be generous for the next few years though tighter limits on property flipping swift resale at inflated prices should curtail speculation and the emergence of a property bubble
8131827 over the medium term abu dhabis property market will mature as a large number of residential and mixed use projects come on stream
8131828 in the interim though the glut of construction will keep commodity prices high and rents and sale prices will continue to rise
8131829 most of the housing units that will enter the market this year will cater for the high income people the low and medium income people will be the main victim of the shortage and the rent increases

8131833 lo que el gobierno hace es efectista pero en el fondo no resuelve nada
8131834 tenemos que desenmascarar este proceso y recuperar la ofensiva por eso desde el pr ximo lunes 8 de setiembre y por dos semanas vamos a declararnos en estado de movilizaci n hacia un debate parlamentario profundo
8131835 la necesidad de confrontar con la estrategia del gobierno de vaciar de contenido a la mesa de enlace y de pretender hacerle creer a la sociedad que en el campo est todo bien
8131836 lo que hace el gobierno es simplemente dar s ntomas efectistas pero en el fondo no transforma nada
8131837 estamos conteni ndolos porque adem s se suma el malestar de la sequ a y de los mil millones de pesos asignados por el gobierno unos 750 millones van a la oncca para compensar a las aceiteras a la industria l ctea y a los mismos grupos empresarios de siempre

8131857 i think its pretty lame when you let your vampire go out in the day just because you dont want to shoot at night i personally have never seen buffy the vampire slayer or angel im not really a big vampire fan this was really my first
8131858 you were just licking blood out of my head it cant get much more personal than that
8131859 we went to great pains to sort of depict a certain kind of physiology for the fangs
8131860 i wanted to approach the supernatural not as being something that exists outside of nature but something that is more deeply rooted in nature
8131861 its a world where people are actually interacting with each rather than like sitting at their computer and reading blogs all the time thats a long winded way of saying i dont really care
8131862 i was early for a dentist appointment and i was wasting time at barnes amp noble waiting for the time for me to go sit in the lobby i saw a book the first book in the series dead until dark i bought the book i started reading it and i couldnt put it down
8131863 maybe having a vampire for a boyfriend wasnt such a good idea
8131864 i stopped dating vampires when i was 15 having a vampire as a boyfriend isnt always the simplest of things to choose
8131865 vampires are better lovers yeah theyve had hundreds of years to like figure things out and to learn things
8131866 the only original cast member from the original series is leonard nimoy
8131867 more specifically we asked them to consider what a superhero means in the 21st century
8131868 for a while i had been kicking around a superhero story idea but it didnt seem like a modern comic book it was more like something from the silver age or a roger corman movie kind of silly on the one hand but also an earnest tribute to all the comics i read as a kid
8131869 it occurred to me that it might be pretty fascinating to see what a whole roster of writers might do with the superhero premise
8131870 how would a writer with serious comedy chops like jennifer weiner or george singleton handle the superhero challenge how about a writer with a historical bent like scott snyder what time and place would he chose for his hero
8131871 instead of taking the point of view of the hero it takes the point of view of the damsel in distress the hardboiled girl reporter that hes continually saving from certain death
8131872 it turns out that shes not as breathlessly smitten as we remember and the big guy as she refers to her rescuer isnt quite as all american as weve been told and ultimately its more than a deconstruction of the classic superhero scenario its an exploration of the sorts of lies we tell ourselves to make ourselves brave
8131873 the only original cast member from the original series is leonard nimoy
8131874 ive been to a lot of conventions but this one has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairy dust feel of the obama revolution that i had to consult with mike murphy the peppery republican strategist and former mccain guru what is that feeling in the air i asked him submerged hate he promptly replied ah yes now i recognize that sulfurous aroma
8131875 i think everybodys saying oh they dont deserve to be in the top 10

8131882 more moderate growth in display advertising was partially offset by continued weakness in online recruitment advertising
8131883 the decline in print has been so pervasive that its taking the online stuff with it
8131884 julys digital results were due to a relative weak month in display advertising coupled with weaker than expected help wanted advertising across the news media group
8131885 we are expecting better performance in display advertising at nytimes com in august to date in august online advertising for the news media group is trending up in the low double digits
8131886 i did this and this and we did this and this and hey if you are into that then you should support obama
8131887 well heck i said all that stuff about him not having enough experience but dammit vote for him anyway because holy shit we cant vote for mccain because heck were democrats for god sakes
8131888 whose deaths could not be blamed on me for a change
8131889 reductionism is a virulent intellectual disease of ancient vintage an old denial reflex an atavistic tantrum in linguistics reductionism embodies a refusal to come to terms with the complex interactive nature of bio cultural reality in their puzzling propensity for reductionism functionalists are slowly turning themselves into a caricature of chomskyan linguistics
8131890 obviously were extremely disappointed shes a great kid a great player
8131891 i talked to paul hill a little over two weeks ago he eliminated us from her list
8131892 i felt like she was trying to rush me into the process of committing
8131893 every coach wants to get a commitment but myself and my parents weve told her we were going through the process im going to take my visits and then i was going to make my decision when i felt the time was right
8131894 i think that was obviously a misunderstanding a miscommunication all i want to say is we offered tayler hill when she was in eighth grade and weve been waiting on her however many years this has been
8131895 you dont know what you have until its real bullets flying
8131896 at this point i think i know how theyll respond but you dont know
8131897 weve got some more days to practice well get em ready theres a lot more learning to do we need to practice better than we did yesterday weve got to familiarize ourselves more with our opponent its a process and were not quite there yet
8131898 if you ever ask me on tuesday morning if youre ready to play the game on saturday id say no if you are then we could just pack it in and let them go to school the rest of the week
8131899 you just do what you do during the week over and over but to do that you have to practice the way youre going to play you cant just flick a switch and get ready you have to make the investment and do it during the week
8131900 he probably hasnt gotten a lot of sleep getting ready for the first game
8131901 just enjoy it now theyll be gone all too soon
8131902 it turns out the obama campaign and all the pundits had nothing to worry about
8131903 youve got to go out there and gut and skewer mccain
8131904 a lot of democrats are going to vote for mccain
8131905 she did a great job i think she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election she was outstanding
8131906 tracciamo strategie per essere intercettati dalla macchina sperando che si accorga di noi
8131907 in troubled times it was understood that country comes before party that in perilous moments mutual concern for the national interest must be the only factor in political judgments
8131908 theres no place like home or a home or a home or a home
8131909 its a pretty small townhouse but its amazing what you can do without much space
8131910 it is looking like he will be coming back as a regular employee with the same status as he had before
8131911 part of curtis responsibility is to get that evidence to defend himself especially when it isnt being provided by others
8131912 it should show our city that our union isnt going to back off and cower when the city is clearly doing something wrong
8131913 we are absolutely delighted with the news if true that rich is about to be reinstated and that common sense has prevailed
8131914 we are living in a pc world which is destroying us where you actually cant put the hard word on people when they have digressed and committed bad blunders
8131915 in the evenings we went to the rugby parties with the kids who slept in the back of the car we cant do that any more because we havent got rid of the perpetrators that actually destroy our society
8131916 the one thing i believe is important in life is respect they respected authority they respected teachers i respected the teachers we lack a great deal of respect for authority nowadays theres always someone protesting
8131917 yes i smacked other peoples children but i never hit them but we are not allowed to do that any more in this pc world
8131918 to us scenic is natural terrain not an altered terrain its a natural view of a forest open hillside creek sweeping view of the ocean not a building for industrial use
8131919 in essence there would be two different categories of wineries
8131920 it is a beautiful location we wanted to capture the scenic quality of the natural terrain
8131921 its not very scenic for la honda weve been looking at gaping holes in the ridge for five years
8131922 do you believe obama can become president without the votes of folks who support hillary
8131923 in one way i rather hope he doesnt get caught
8131924 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8131925 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8131926 the strong man john mitchell and the secrets of watergate

8131939 london stock exchange set up offices in beijing in january we hope that more chinese enterprises be listed in london and also hope that more chinese fund choose london to be their offices
8131940 we need to look at it first and see what the operators can do then we can call a consultative forum that would involve them to see how the fraudulent activities could be blocked
8131941 given the crucial role information technology it is playing and will continue to play in national socio economic and technological development of nigeria and the attainment of the millennium development goals it has become imperative that the federal government pay particular attention to the devastating impact of cyber criminality and terrorism in the e commerce and electronic fund transfer landscape this has to be done to prevent possible loss of confidence in the deployment of it as a veritable tool for accelerated development of national economy
8131942 this does not augur well for the nigerian internet experience it hits at two cardinal points we hold dear first a blockage of nigerian domain traffic means that those on the ng domain would have their email or web traffic blocked making the choice of a ng domain space an unwanted option secondly even there is no domain blockage but a country ip block it would mean that those who have hosted their services in nigeria a keep driver for nira would also have their traffic blocked
8131943 we would embark on an multi stakeholder multi national collaboration to assure networks abroad of the safety of nigerian traffic and the capacity of all local internet community and the law enforcement agencies to deal with any reported case of fraud this would ensure that there are no blanket bans of nigerian domains or ip addres
8131944 the fire was so intense theres not a lot of it left

8131953 it is a fact that laws are insufficient in fight against terrorism as if there is no terrorism in our country and they are preventing gendarmery forces from taking efficient and rapid action
8131954 taking advantage of these changes the separatist terrorist organization and its legal extensions have increased their activities and have started to act more freely by misusing the freedoms envisaged by the legal amendments
8131955 however if terrorism is threatening human rights this means that the balance between rights and freedoms and the measures to be taken needs to be reevaluated

8132024 but as nominating barack obama emphasizes the dnc even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mothers voice sleep and dream suck their thumbs and play with their toes
8132025 when we tell kids that unborn children can be killed if their parents dont want them
8132026 we rob them of the knowledge of the god given right to life and we destroy their moral foundation abortion is wrong because its a baby its always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent baby

8132035 im voting obama because the usa does have 57 states
8132036 part of the consideration is what was the best use of that time
8132037 to a large extent the judgment of the meeting organizers was to have the experts in these conditions which are not vaccine safety experts to have most of the agenda
8132038 that this is another case that points to the need of better data on the risks and benefits of vaccinations in children with these rare disorders
8132039 after caring for hundreds of children with mitochondrial disease i cant recall a single one that had a complication from vaccination
8132040 to identify who those children are for whom vaccination might cause or worsen a mitochondrial dysfunction so that we can figure out a way to immunize those children safely
8132041 there is no test available right now to screen for mitochondrial disorders that is anywhere near sensitive or specific
8132042 so the whole concept of screening prior to vaccination is a fantasy
8132043 were talking about two things we dont understand very well mitochondrial disorder and autism and putting them together
8132044 now being convinced that the superiority of the defensive rightly understood is very great and much greater than may appear at first sight we conceive that the greater number of those periods of inaction which occur in war are thus explained without involving any contradiction
8132045 thus therefore the political object as the original motive of the war will be the standard for determining both the aim of the military force and also the amount of effort to be made

8132061 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8132062 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8132063 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions

8132129 she was tired and needed some rest and a little bit down i came back up at 8 oclock and she wasnt there
8132130 upset because i didnt know where she was but i wasnt concerned
8132131 actually her friend from oregon filed the police report on friday
8132132 he said she was a little down and she knew he was going to go swimming she loves the water he misunderstood when i spoke to him that nobody had seen here since about 11 oclock when he spoke to her and he thought she was going swimming

8132136 hta has a very large budget but they do tend to use some of the money for other things besides marketing
8132137 we need to make a dramatic shift in the allocation of how hta funds are used at least at this point in time

8132146 i would urge the school to review the decision in consultation with their parent community
8132147 i think the decision by the principal in townsville the other day was prompted by the fact that increasingly we as a community are wrapping our children in cotton wool
8132148 i think our generation of parents are mollycoddling their children
8132149 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of the provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent of the provinces being poppy free
8132150 at this point in time i would like to ask nato and isaf to concentrate on these three very physical targets targets in the hands of either insurgents or criminal groups
8132151 and therefore not attacking the farmers but attacking those who provide the opportunity for farmers to cultivate opium
8132152 they bring a lot of heavy weapons and heavy logistical support from other areas in order to enter the camp to destroy the camp and to kill civilians this is the strategy of omar al bashir since he came from turkey he said that he wants to confront the international community he wants to wipe all the camps from the map in darfur
8132153 according to our people on the ground they have seen 11 bodies in unconfirmed reports the number of dead persons was higher than that number such reports will be confirmed by unamid today
8132154 we are concerned about what is going on of course and we are engaging the government of south darfur it is not the first time that these kind of events took place last year it was an almost similar scenario so we have to come out with a lasting solution and as a matter of fact the government of south darfur asked us to organize a meeting with idp representatives and representatives from international ngos to find a solution to this tension which is prevailing in this big and huge camp since a long time
8132155 we are very very very astonished by the failure of the unamid forces
8132156 they came to protect civilians and now they let civilians be killed by the khartoum government

8132159 all the money has been unfrozen for money laundering to be proven you have to show it was the product of a crime
8132160 pakistan has withdrawn its requests for judicial assistance and has said it has no claim on the frozen assets
8132161 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8132162 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8132163 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8132164 we are continuing to collect information through the afghan authorities but his safety has yet to be confirmed
8132165 we will do our best so that mr ito is rescued as soon as possible
8132166 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
8132167 whoa hold on a second i dont trust you for 1 second
8132168 ehh this is probably a really bad idea but at least i can trust that you are acting with the best intentions
8132169 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
8132170 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years
8132171 im here tonight because i know the change we need requires a leader with a steely resolve a powerful vision for our future and a passion for helping working people
8132172 in the end it came down to whether or not my endorsement was for real or if it was just something that was said off the cuff it wasnt said off the cuff it is real i think obamas the better person for the job
8132173 the resources we have right here at home from domestically produced natural gas including liquefied natural gas from alaska to biomass wind and solar
8132174 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8132175 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8132176 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8132177 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8132178 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8132179 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8132180 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8132181 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8132182 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8132183 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8132184 she drove to my office 15 minutes after i arrived on her own and she drove away on her own
8132185 she had called me and asked if she could come by
8132186 hes in a coma and they dont know whats going to turn out
8132187 no bit of information is too small if you have anything on this please call the connellsville police department a partial plate description of the driver more description of the van anything would be helpful
8132188 the person left us there to die were praying for him that hell come out of this
8132189 id like to hopefully speak with the operator accidents happen i believe the operator was scared and they need to come in
8132190 you dont have to go home but you cant stay here

8132192 transnational terrorism across the world leads to an average of 420 deaths a year with a global population of 6 6 billion thats not a big risk the chance of being killed in a road accident is very much higher even the chance of contracting hiv aids would be much higher
8132193 while signage is still an important component cash strapped consumers are finding that now more than ever it takes a special deal to convince them to try new drinks
8132194 taken individually the irregularities in this case generally appear minor
8132195 when reviewed in their entirety however we believe that the handling of this case raises some significant concerns
8132196 boyd corporate had knowledge and failed to act that is the exact definition
8132197 while the investigation file in this case contained considerable evidence to support a willful classification there is also evidence to the contrary
8132198 since substantially similar violations were cited previously at another boyd gaming property in nevada federal osha likely would have classified them as repeat if not willful violations
8132199 i dont recall that weve ever said something along those lines to say they wouldnt have done it that way clearly implies fed osha is concerned about what happened and wants to make sure procedures would preclude it from happening again
8132200 maybe they were afraid to fight it but you know what they could have tried
8132201 senior professional staff who are familiar with the investigation and conversant with technical compliance issues are available to participate in the resolution of significant and complex cases whenever possible
8132202 in this case for example nevada could have made czehowski available for a brief period in order to assist in the resolution of this high profile double fatality accident case
8132203 nevada should carefully consider the appropriateness of the use of consultation as a tool in future settlement agreements

8132209 what makes you happy odd but that question has surfaced in my mind many times not really having a clear answer i know for sure collecting rocks or sea shells would top the list this would seem to be a complete waste of time but during the process i am completely happy gardening and reading well not just reading but holding a book in my hands is comforting would be near the top but today painting this huge scene on a tiny panel made me truly happy oil on panel 5
8132210 updated dont tell me you forgot to pray for the holy souls in purgatory today
8132211 your diocese is very small in comparison with the universal church which i carry on my shoulders your cares will be very light in comparison with mine i too suffered from a grave defect of memory but i promised to say a fervent prayer daily for the holy souls who in returned have obtained for me an excellent memory do you likewise dear father and you will have cause to rejoice
8132212 but see you cant think that way everyone has something wrong with them think of it that way instead it might not make sense when you first think of this but everyone
8132213 you know i havent had sex in so long that its almost like im a virgin once again you know when i was i think a junior in high school i was on the bus and i looked around and some people had on crappy shoes you know the kind that you buy a payless that try to imitate the high brands as much as possible but you still can always tell well this was around the time when i finally started actually wearing brand shoes you know i wouldnt get all those crappy knock offs and i kinda felt like an idiot for wearing them in the past and then all of a sudden i look around and people are actually wearing those knockoffs well lately it seems like everyone around me is with someone you know and for the first time its like whatever ill hang out with them and thats what i really need is to actually have those friend couples that dont mind me being there with them while theyre in between things
8132214 you went off the subject theres nothing there that i can use but at some times i think that weed has literly clasped itself unto your goddamn brain and from now on or at least for a few years anything that comes out of your mouth isnt going to go with what was being talking about i mean you could get away from this but youre still going to keep smoking so its going to continue but sometimes i wish that i could just not worry about stuff after awhile you really start wondering what the whole point about it is its like in a band the songs that they think are going to be the hits usually are the lesser and the ones they werent even planning on become bigger hits than they ever thought possible now do you go along with that and sing those greaters that you never saw at your next concert it really depends on what kind of person you are are you going to start liking those other songs of yours because thats all that people talk about or are you going to sit there and just write more songs and not care about whats going on around you its the musicians out there that go along with the rest of society that have to watch their backs for the people that come out of the shadows dressed as cattle to kill them for going away from what their job is really all about you can get as rich as you want just dont forget what you started out believing in now you can still be a sellout and believe in what you always did before you went and soldout but that has to be something that was in you planning all along people who are rich want to be rich the bums on th street okay they want to be bums if they didnt want to live like that theyd fucking do something about it

8132219 to me the secret behind becoming successful is very simple i have personally experienced that the care one extends to his or her parents leads to success
8132220 i had written to the prime minister that i believe that the dispute in jammu and kashmir is between the separatists and nationalists not commenting on this only this he has written to me that i would like to assure you that the government will not bow down to separatist forces in taking decision
8132221 the state and the central governments have acted in a partisan manner on amarnath issue bjp demands that the land must be restored to shri amarnath shrine board the separatists should be hauled before law for challenging the sovereignty of the indian republic

8132225 there should be something special in my collection at that time olympic games were going on and it came in my mind if any metal coin has been issued in the olympics i came to know that the first olympics coin was issued in 1952 from helinski which was host country for the games from my sources i got the coin after that i have been trying to collect more coins
8132226 unfortunately i am unable to get beijing coins till date i got few coins but i am trying for more coins i feel very soon i would get them
8132227 india is making a very important contribution for the development of our forum it is one of the biggest and the most influential countries of the world and having it onboard is very important
8132228 action plans have been submitted by various member states they relate to human dimensions the fight against terrorism and transnational crimes non security challenges like drug trafficking cica has a heterogeneous membership and this is an asset when you have a homogeneous forum you can decide on important issues but on the other hand the fact is that we have different countries different cultures we are dealing with different confidence building measures and this is the backbone of our institution
8132229 trust and confidence needs time to build and each member country has been assigned specific areas based on its competence and past record in that particular sphere
8132230 we dont want to duplicate other regional entities the intellectual capability of our forum has to be seen to be different we are at a stage where we are developing mechanisms and action plans where they will lead i dont know we are looking to build trust and promote common interaction among member states as far as time lines are concerned my view is that the experiences one forum cannot be used in anothers context
8132231 goodwill and collective security we can think of conditions for releasing a more prosperous and unique region
8132232 terrorism in whatever form is not accepted by kazakhstan we condemn it in the strongest possible terms there is no justification for it we have supported all anti terrorism initiatives be it by the united states or any other country kazakhstans support for such initiatives can be assessed by the fact that this country krygistan allowed the u s to use its airspace to reach afghanistan to tackle the taliban and al qaeda immediately after 9 11 kazakhstan also has an arrangement with the nato to provide humanitarian aid this is a very important part of our ties with the u s there are other areas also where we collaborate such as border management immigration processes and combating drug trafficking
8132233 we would like to diversify our contacts in the field of security we have a small military unit whose responsibility is to help kazakhstans partners in their time of need we are proud of this partnership

8132236 there were about 5 000 flight plans in the system but a lot of them were airborne and unaffected
8132237 the only flights that were affected were those that had already pushed off from the gates and couldnt get off the ground it created a backlog
8132238 but look its in the win column and thats what you care about
8132239 you know what i can be upset in one batter one inning and its over

8132265 mendis reminds me a bit of johnny gleeson though he releases the ball much quicker is taller and stronger he also has good change of pace
8132266 i dont know the reason whey they failed against mendis as far as warne was concerned over a period of time people read him more but warnes ability stood the test of time like any great batsman or bowlers its a testing time for him mendis his action has not been studied in detail by opposing batsmen not been exposed enough
8132267 the stadium will have a seating capacity of 50 000 to 60 000 spectators everything is in a fluid state now we have only taken the initial step in remitting rs one lakh as first years payment towards the lease
8132268 firstly we have to take possession of the land we will go strictly by the government order which stipulates that all facilities to be set up would be used for the game of cricket only formal signing of the agreement between the government and the tnca will take place shortly
8132269 apart from the state of the art stadium with a couple of turf pitches we will also have three more grounds to accommodate our league fixtures besides facilities like gymnasium swimming pool and indoor practice area
8132270 there is a standard draft agreement with the tamil nadu government tnca will strictly adhere to that
8132271 these and other matters like appointment of the architect will be decided by the executive committee of tnca in its meeting tomorrow he said adding
8132272 i have been involved in sports for a very long time being a sports official
8132273 i used to be in charge of snooker later after the cricket association was established i got to know more and more about cricket and began to like it more and more so i changed from snooker to cricket
8132274 i think that cricket in china is already moving ahead
8132275 they have 140 level one coaches and umpires now theyve achieved that in the period since 2005 that is indeed very noteworthy
8132276 the icc has believed for quite some time that there is a real opportunity for cricket in china and one of our projects is to explore the possibility of cricket becoming very large in this country
8132277 china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific
8132278 they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
8132279 the icc came to us and said they had a very charming game which could be introduced to china and at that time the then vice president and secretary general of the cca paid a visit to hong kong to observe the hong kong international sixes
8132280 we found that cricket is a very good for chinese people because it emphasises hand eye co ordination
8132281 now what we need to do urgently is improve our high performance
8132282 they can score from anywhere on the park either through their pace or their power
8132283 they have a lot of good players and they back themselves
8132284 traditionally we are expected to at least be competitive against those teams and we are really looking forward to testing ourselves against the super 14 base sides
8132285 well know more after this weekend and more again in another month where we are at

8132291 we have strict orders from our higher ups to give no quarter to curfew violators and deal with any violations firmly
8132292 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8132293 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations

8132300 in some way they are making a desperate effort to be remembered
8132301 this rush to finish something that could not be finished in weeks or months could be catastrophic they can only accomplish it by leaving loads of things unresolved
8132302 without examining public opinion the balance of force in fatah the state of the leadership of abu mazen mahmoud abbas who will probably be out of office as well next year it is not responsible to rush a peace accord
8132303 they dont look at palestinian politics which includes what is aired on the radio taught in school and preached in the mosque all of which makes up public opinion
8132304 what people say in arabic is really what is important
8132305 abu mazen is in many ways relatively moderate but he is not moderate on the palestinian refugees right of return which is very close to his heart
8132306 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8132307 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8132308 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8132309 let me be clear weve conducted an intensive investigation chased down numerous leads and carefully reviewed the evidence to date
8132310 it is a very serious federal crime to threaten a presidential candidate in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama
8132311 reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time and they cannot independently be corroborated
8132312 the evidence involving alleged threats does not warrant federal charges but the investigation is ongoing and we are keeping an open mind
8132313 what matters at this moment from a legal point of view the law recognises a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the racist rantings of drug users
8132314 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8132315 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8132316 by proposing to ban uranium mining the premier and state alp government is effectively robbing one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country of the right to earn a living and potentially achieve an equity stake in a major mining project
8132317 there has been a great deal of mischievous scare mongering on the issue of uranium in wa and there will be serious long term consequences for indigenous people and wa as a whole
8132318 however the wider effect of this policy will be to reinforce the growing international perception that was mining policies are not conducive to investment
8132319 uranium and other mining companies will be reconsidering their plans to invest in wa today
8132320 cme is calling for the government to not proceed with such legislation if it is re elected
8132321 the future of uranium mining in western australia should be considered in the context of strategic resource development planning in wa and as part of a wider debate around future energy supplies and greenhouse gas abatement
8132322 cci is also disappointed that the alp in wa has declared that nuclear power has no future in wa without undertaking a sensible and rational debate on the issue
8132323 such a debate would be the opportunity to expose the misconceptions and misleading statements about uranium mining that are being put about in western australia

8132333 he also hopes mps agree that his approach is the most appropriate one for responding to the issues of risk to the public and police and for continuing the tradition of having a routinely unarmed police service a value closely held by new zealanders
8132334 tasers are highly effective in controlling aggressive and violent individuals under the influence of mind altering substances or in a mental health crisis
8132335 the greens are very opposed to these painful and sometimes lethal stun guns being introduced into the police armoury
8132336 introducing a greater level of violence in policing actually weakens its effectiveness
8132337 it is quite possibly the worst for us in living memory
8132338 obviously they have drainage built into them when they are constructed and you can play numerous games on them

8132340 the scarcity of grounds means that each individual pitch gets a lot of use each weekend so even when the grounds are not totally closed restrictions on use mean that we cant play our full programme

8132343 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8132344 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

8132468 the declaration overnight by russian president medvedev i dont believe is a helpful contribution
8132469 indeed some may regard that as provocative i dont think it helps circumstances in georgia and i dont think it helps relationships generally between russia and the rest of the world
8132470 were looking for a very small portion of the royalties that come out of this country
8132471 well thats up to the premier and the cabinet to make that decision im very certain that our government isnt going to let cloncurry run out of water
8132472 immediately after the tremors in irkutsk there were cuts in electricity mobile connections and the internet banks postponed work some houses lost roofs

8132475 when the republicans get started next week at their convention theyre going to let the attacks loose in prime time right out of the chute
8132476 id never advocate using untruths or distortions but we ought to be going at them blow for blow right here on this floor and real soon
8132477 lets give people a reason to be for us rather than just telling them not to be for the other guy
8132478 a lot of people dont feel like they really know obama yet
8132479 i think michelle obama did a pretty good job of helping them get to know him and she did that in a very positive way that was very well received
8132480 i think well take it to mccain id expect thats what joe biden will do when its his turn to speak
8132481 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8132482 republicans have no qualms about using swift boat ads willie horton and just about everything else while we just sit back
8132483 i think john kerry made a big mistake when he didnt hit back in 2004 were in here preaching to the choir when we ought to be preaching to the folks at home watching this on tv

8132486 there are two prices you pay for any appliance the price you pay to buy it and the price you pay to operate it
8132487 if you want to use it for parties unplug it and leave the door propped open then plug it in a day before you need it
8132488 ninety percent of the energy an incandescent bulb uses is heat
8132489 what we take away from that is we may be experiencing a slight fluctuation in our home values but as a general rule we are flat
8132490 were not seeing huge gains but were also not losing value
8132491 the most relaxing part of my week is actually on weekends
8132492 i know what im doing with the home depot team crew chief greg zipadelli and everybody at joe gibbs racing during the week its a little busier im losing a little bit of sleep working hard trying to get ready for february
8132493 you do what joe gibbs has taught me you hire the right people to do the right jobs
8132494 once you do that you let them do their jobs ive got people that run the race teams in indiana and run the racetracks that i know do a good job for me they do the right things and that lets me have the time to focus on the variables i have to focus on
8132495 but if anybody is able to chew it its him its going to take him a little while to get this program up to speed and at his age he doesnt have a whole lot of productive years left its a risk but i understand what hes doing and why hes doing it
8132496 the reality of it is were not where we need to be right now
8132497 in the next two weeks we may find something to put us in perfect position right now weve got some catching up to do
8132498 if they win this its going to be open season on every homeowner in fort worth
8132499 no one is going to want to rent my house no one is going want to buy my house

8132519 yeah well i can dive up to 90 feet without air and im an expert in demolitions one navy seal is worth 13 other men
8132520 it will help us crack the mysteries of these enormously powerful emissions
8132521 we dont yet understand the mechanism for how the particles that emit the gamma rays are accelerated
8132522 were not even sure what the nature of the particles are
8132523 today regarded as one of the top scientists of the 20th century
8132524 when new evidence came in to suggest that his initial assessment of putin was wrong bush tended to dismiss it
8132525 maliki is proving to be a more significant leader than most people around bush thought he could be
8132526 last year everyone i talked to in the administration thought that maliki had to go bush didnt seem to buy off on what everyone else was saying
8132527 while there are often policy issues that dont exactly go the way we want them to the situation on the other hand could be much worse if the president did not have a decent working relationship with some of these leaders
8132528 there is something that personal relations can add but there are fundamental national interests that cant be escaped
8132529 i promise you if you ask the russians they will give you a long litany of things where they think they have cooperated with us and we havent given much in return
8132530 if we continue to lose ice at this rate we will best
8132531 were going to lose that ice so weve got to understand what this means for the rest of us
8132532 already showing patches of open water within the ice much of the beaufort sea north of alaska is open and the laptev sea and east siberian sea have opened extensively in the past 13 days
8132533 it is very unusual to see so many bears in the open water at one time during a short flight period
8132534 its very worrisome its what we had anticipated but its happening right before our eyes
8132535 its just yet another wake up call in a long line of wake up calls to politicians in this country that says hey get your act together when it comes to global warming
8132536 current sea ice reduction is progressing at a very fast rate that appears to have no analogs in the past
8132537 sustained changes in sea ice coverage may cause perhaps the largest temperature changes observed on the planet
8132538 we knew we were vulnerable starting out in terms of ice cover
8132539 the detroit city council has wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars paying for an attorney to conduct a political witch hunt
8132540 certainly cases involving soldiers in the midst of a violent war are ones that belong within the military system
8132541 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8132542 the confusion here is between john mccain rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on senator obama
8132543 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8132544 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
8132545 confidence itself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8132546 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8132547 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8132548 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to lead by example was the liberation of iraq
8132549 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8132550 there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama the reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time
8132551 could not believe how close obama was to becoming president
8132552 it came out of the blue im disappointed if any adult takes advantage of his or her position as a teacher and role model she was popular and she produced a good yearbook she seemed like a regular teacher

8132579 my thought is why would amc put a stop to some really great social media marketing for their show at least perhaps theyd take a note from the success of the characters and take the project over themselves

8132599 imagine being able to throw something on the field and you cant be ejected
8132600 this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8132601 if it takes too long this is not like football youve got a pitcher thats standing there i tell you what itll probably be used as a ploy by some managers just to freeze the pitcher for five or six minutes and cool him off if hes going really well baseballs got to look at this thing carefully but i want my red hankie
8132602 im glad theyre going to practice it so to speak before they get to postseason
8132603 hopefully it doesnt take up a lot of time if it comes into play ultimately the goal is to get the call right and maybe this will help
8132604 im signed through next year so theres plenty of time
8132605 but this will be my last job i can tell you my last managing job i can stay in baseball as a consultant
8132606 my concern is theyll start the project and run out of money halfway
8132607 then well have a monster a real mess on our hands
8132608 youre always worried about your project until you start turning dirt
8132609 i dont see the project stopping its just going to take a while
8132610 our goal continues to be the selection of a best value proposal by the end of this year
8132611 all construction projects the last five years have gone up 40 to 60 percent
8132612 this project was identified in late 2000 or early 2001 to move forward the project back then was a 400 million project this is a huge interchange
8132613 two or three people in my neighborhood work in the hospital district and theyre waiting for that train to come up
8132614 the commuters in my neighborhood they talk about the funnel all the time
8132615 im not just very confident im all but positive that we will obtain appropriate compensation for people
8132616 i would never have guessed yesterday that wed have 1 100 people contact us and i think theyll find that there are bigger problems here than theyd expected
8132617 omfg wtf is mc jack wearing lolol put ur motherfuckin fuck lol
8132618 it can damage their legacy in the long run if they dont get a grip pretty quick
8132619 remember 18 million people voted for me 18 million people give or take voted for barack
8132620 is not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8132621 i wonder if michelle would give the queen one of her little knuckle punches

8132624 scotts heroes and invited two members of the u s armed forces to one home game each month with vip treatment
8132625 considering what weve been doing this year with the military i thought it would be a good idea to head over there
8132626 this is actually my first time to walter reed weve always gone to bethesda md in the past it was really good to put some of the faces with whats going on overseas that really makes it hit home a little more when you get to shake these guys hands and just get to tell them how much you appreciate what theyre doing over there
8132627 it was just a great experience something ill never forget
8132628 i told wife andrea today that im so glad i went because it really opened my eyes up to what happens and what they go through after the fact these guys are over there doing this for us and you feel a little guilty it really puts it into perspective
8132629 there are a lot of people over there enduring stuff that we cant even imagine so we can have our freedom and do the things we love to do

8132632 mr glenns letter represents a direct challenge to mr peters credibility
8132633 from the only other person in the world in a position to know the facts
8132634 unless he can provide a credible explanation about this serious issue he should be unacceptable to helen clark as a minister in her labour led government
8132635 mr peters will be unacceptable as a minister in a government led by me unless he can provide a credible explanation
8132636 to us scenic is natural terrain not an altered terrain its a natural view of a forest open hillside creek sweeping view of the ocean not a building for industrial use
8132637 in essence there would be two different categories of wineries
8132638 it is a beautiful location we wanted to capture the scenic quality of the natural terrain
8132639 its not very scenic for la honda weve been looking at gaping holes in the ridge for five years
8132640 the 2008 convention program will bring together americans who will speak to john mccains vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations we are excited about next week and we are looking forward to showcasing john mccains life long record of putting his country first

8132642 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
8132643 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
8132644 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8132645 is a big incentive to buy now vs later when you most likely wont have that option for you
8132646 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
8132647 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away
8132648 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8132649 are a concern as they may foreshadow a slowdown in market demand
8132650 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8132651 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8132652 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us

8132658 there was a concern about the increased cost to carriers we accommodated that by reducing the speed zones
8132659 its disappointing that it cant be all that it could be
8132660 if we didnt lose one or two females a year
8132661 that could be the difference between letting this population recover and letting this population continue into extinction
8132662 we want the speed to be slow enough so that the whales have a chance to get out of the way or the blow will be a glancing blow and they will survive

8132666 obviously were extremely disappointed shes a great kid a great player
8132667 i talked to paul hill a little over two weeks ago he eliminated us from her list
8132668 i felt like she was trying to rush me into the process of committing
8132669 every coach wants to get a commitment but myself and my parents weve told her we were going through the process im going to take my visits and then i was going to make my decision when i felt the time was right
8132670 i think that was obviously a misunderstanding a miscommunication all i want to say is we offered tayler hill when she was in eighth grade and weve been waiting on her however many years this has been

8132693 vi ved at langt st rstedelen af seerne i dag har widescreen tv og det giver derfor mening at ndre sendeformatet til 16 9 mange af vores seere er med god grund tr tte af de sorte bj lker men fra den 1 september er det definitivt slut enkelte programmer som kun er produceret i 4 3 vil dog fortsat blive udsendt i det gamle format men det drejer sig om en meget lille andel af den samlede programflade
8132694 at motek entertainment we provide cutting edge production work for features commercials television video games online and mobile media
8132695 nexentastor delivers the ideal balance of performance scalability and cost of ownership for digital media applications and by switching to nexentastors unique zfs based architecture weve seen time savings for our storage administration and more importantly limitless and instant backups for our designs
8132696 we are very happy to highlight the positive experience of motek entertainment in using nexentastor in front of iscsi for improved performance and manageability
8132697 were seeing more and more users that like the cost savings of iscsi but want the enhanced performance and the advanced data integrity capabilities of nexentastor as sata disks can suffer from silent data corruption the unique ability of zfss end to end check sums to catch this corruption is especially important for firms like motek who rely upon accurate data for their success
8132698 it turns out the obama campaign and all the pundits had nothing to worry about

8132702 by far this is our most extreme dramatic and deeply disturbing album to date the legend of gilles de rais has been given fresh vampyrical life in this conceptual meisterwerk swathed in pitch black magic and a viciousness unsurpassed in the annals of cradle history screw what our detractors say everyone who has heard this album has bruised their jaws on the pentagram bejewelled floor
8132703 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture

8132735 we started doing get out the vote activities since 2004 and weve been involved in that 2004 2006 this year and we have seen and this has been backed up by national studies the reason that you have such a low voter turnout is that its still a community that is fairly new to the voting process you know theres kind of a habit that needs to be created and people are a little bit removed from the process
8132736 were more than just a jukebox radio station we have hourly newscasts provided by cnn espanol we also have local news in the morning following our cnn
8132737 we believe that it would be very important to provide a flow of information regarding the candidates running for president and for local offices so in the past weve invited local candidates to appear and we expect that as we approach the november election well have experts or supporters from each camp on our airwaves to again provide the information that people need to make the right choices
8132738 there should be something special in my collection at that time olympic games were going on and it came in my mind if any metal coin has been issued in the olympics i came to know that the first olympics coin was issued in 1952 from helinski which was host country for the games from my sources i got the coin after that i have been trying to collect more coins
8132739 unfortunately i am unable to get beijing coins till date i got few coins but i am trying for more coins i feel very soon i would get them

8132741 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8132742 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8132743 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8132744 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8132745 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8132746 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8132747 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8132748 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8132749 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8132750 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8132751 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8132752 served the complainants need to provide a plausible explanation for some suddenly foreseen unfortunate consequence of a consensual encounter usually sexual with a male acquaintance
8132753 she said that she has been in a relationship with one of the defendants for the past 14 years but he and his friends took advantage of her and then stole two of her mobiles after they raped her
8132754 when the woman was confronted by the mens statement she later confessed that she had reported the incident to the police because she was afraid that the defendants were going to speak to her family when they stole her phone
8132755 apparently the woman was said to have been seeing the men for money but there were no charges filed as there was no evidence against them
8132756 hahaha yeah ive seen some weird interps i knew and evangelical christian who assumed getting a computer virus meant satan had done it because how else would it happen well assholes who write computer viruses
8132757 there is a lot of pre emptive demolition going on this is already having a visual impact cities are beginning to look like broken teeth
8132758 i bought the book for much the same reason its write up was so wonderful
8132759 computer singular that is a stunning thought sharing is virtuous but even a computer oh my you must have a glare louder than your thoroughfare
8132760 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8132761 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8132762 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8132763 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8132764 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8132765 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8132766 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8132767 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8132768 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8132769 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8132770 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8132771 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8132772 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8132773 all documents public under the principle of peoples right to know ant the states duty to disclose
8132774 evidence from both national and local elections confirm that outspending does not increase a candidates chance of winning
8132775 kde 4 1 0 is all shiny and sexy but i cannot imagine running it smoothly on a pc with less than 768mb of ram
8132776 double buffering is only needed for parts of the screen that are visible and actually change which is for nearly nothing

8132783 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8132784 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8132785 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum
8132786 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing
8132787 the application failed to intialize properly click ok to terminate
8132788 how did you feel when you were at the precinct
8132789 that creates a situation where you are asking for problems
8132790 i dont know what is going to happen but its not going to be pleasant
8132791 this was at least a rational way of dealing with this
8132792 collaboration with the public is a vital ingredient in our efforts to keep the city safe

8132795 its great that more of our students are opening the door to college by taking the sat almost 30 more than at the start of the administration
8132796 is the increase in lower scores coming from kids whose first language isnt english
8132797 you would have to compare kids from the same population this year and last year and see how they did
8132798 anytime you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8132799 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8132800 and therefore and only in those cases should we have replay
8132801 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8132802 the big plus is that you can now shoot video with a great lens
8132803 the one thing thats really been missing from the slr market has been the ability to record high quality video
8132804 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late

8132809 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8132810 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown

8132814 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8132815 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8132816 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8132817 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8132818 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8132819 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8132820 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8132821 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8132822 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8132823 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8132824 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8132825 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security
8132826 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8132827 hes a charming guy hes a celebrity but does he have the judgment and experience that comes from a life long service in one sector or another
8132828 the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win wouldve been to pick hillary clinton
8132829 it is a no brainer she got 18 million votes joe got 9 000 votes
8132830 thats what the choice for a president comes down to it doesnt come down to a choice between the abstract and the abstract it comes down to a choice between two people
8132831 you cant avoid that comparison youve got one candidate with a lot of experience and one with virtually no experience
8132832 i cant imagine anybody who is ready to debate joe biden
8132833 im not sure when john mccain will make his vice president announcement or who itll be
8132834 i have confidence in his instincts hes proven time and time again that those instincts serve him well and i think hell make a wise choice
8132835 hurricane gustav should pass near the southwestern peninsula of haiti tonight and move near or just south of eastern cuba on wednesday
8132836 now would be a good time however for families to review their evacuation plans
8132837 these rains will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides
8132838 coastal storm surge flooding of 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous battering waves can be expected in areas of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area
8132839 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8132840 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8132841 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8132842 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8132843 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8132844 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8132845 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8132846 since the conventions are basically party functions and the money goes to pay for what the party wants to do in part these convention contributions are like campaign contributions
8132847 and campaign contributions reinforce lobbying representations because you can get in much more easily to see somebody if youre a donor
8132848 i saw our defense really come in and play well today and thats what carried us
8132849 were switching from a team that expects its pitcher or one other key player to dominate to a team that just needs its pitcher to give us a ball we can field
8132850 mariah has really stepped up and became a dominant force out there for us
8132851 i think we just got content with our lead there and allowed too many errors that let them back in it
8132852 this was a huge win for us and its just good to know what were capable of
8132853 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8132854 im going to take off my jacket get a little less formal here
8132855 were hoping for 5 000 people and we want the mood to be thoroughly democratic and we want the peopl to feel inspired about voting for candidates who actually represent them
8132856 i remember that a soldier is just a uniform following orders a warrior is the man or woman that follows their conscience and does the right thing in the face of adversity
8132857 to support jeremy call or email hon diane finley minister of citizenship and immigration and ask her to intervene in this case phone 613 996 4974 email
8132858 immediately after the tremors in irkutsk there were cuts in electricity mobile connections and the internet banks postponed work some houses lost roofs
8132859 there were no reports of serious destruction or casualties thank god
8132860 shall be a priest upon his throne thus a king priest and the counsel of peace shall be between them both
8132861 without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better
8132862 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those aaronic high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself
8132863 strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil
8132864 to prop up existing organizations as opposed to creating fresh educational practices in the schools
8132865 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8132866 the fact that obama and ayers were working together stems from the pretty sharp left leaning ideology that both of them shared to some extent
8132867 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old lets talk about standing up for america today
8132868 mccains consultants are going to go out and make ads that are misleading about barack obama we are going to make sure that they are answered we have to make sure that the truth is out there and that we are answering with force
8132869 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8132870 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8132871 we think it is against the territorial integrity of georgia and we cannot accept it
8132872 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
8132873 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
8132874 while many single technology centric efforts are underway around the world there is no unifying infrastructure in the u s or abroad to support multi faceted ocean energy research and development our center is helping to bridge that gap
8132875 florida and the uk are committed to increasing climate friendly economic opportunities for our respective citizens improving our public policies on reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases exchanging expertise on research and technology and increasing public awareness
8132876 currently ocean energy is undeveloped compared to other conventional and renewable energy technologies
8132877 while many single technology centric efforts are underway around the world there is no unifying infrastructure in the u s or abroad to support multi faceted ocean energy research and development our center is helping to bridge that gap
8132878 it might be the increased overtime would cost you the salary of one man
8132879 a lot of the equipment we will use is already waiting in iraq which saves money and time for us to follow equipment that other units are currently using
8132880 however our brigade is trained in certain techniques that requires us to bring some of the equipment that we have here
8132881 while soldiers are conducting a dangerous task of moving vehicles on a train very heavy pieces of equipment and narrow tracks and such were also dealing with the idea of missing our families for a year
8132882 were not just talking about protecting ourselves and the people
8132883 but also building an entire society and a new governmental structure and handing it to them and them doing it themselves which is a very difficult task
8132884 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar
8132885 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check

8132889 i think some of the sophomores and freshmen can be a little intimidated when they first come out
8132890 i think in some ways it takes the pressure off some of the younger girls to have those four though
8132891 they know that those girls are going to carry the team so they have some time to learn to fit into the system before it will be their turn
8132892 weve really matured on our back line and having confidence on defense is just going to give us that many more opportunities up front
8132893 with bree and tracee up front we really have a great offense going

8132899 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight we must win and it is a fight we must win together we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8132900 there are there are large large portions of ohio where people did not actually cast a vote for sen obama in the spring
8132901 and now were asking them to cast it in november
8132902 republicans have painted him as an elitist but hes from a working class family and hes got to get back to it

8132908 ive either been shooting abroad or just been busy in mumbai its been so hectic that i havent been to my house in bangalore for nearly three years

8132922 not like you need it with all the money youre getting from the government
8132923 the city was below sea level so this was going to happen eventually
8132924 barack obama got a special deal from a convicted felon
8132925 i think it was a strange thing for barack obama to seize upon
8132926 if homes is going to be the topic of discussion that barack obama is going to end up on the short end of that one
8132927 one of the things that we sensed was that students were not as engaged at the university as students were at other universities
8132928 we wanted to have some sort of intensive program that would really connect them to the university connect them with each other and connect them with the faculty and staff
8132929 contrary to what i hear a lot of institutions are doing
8132930 the movement generally across the country has been to reduce the amount of time between when students are allowed to move in and when classes actually start what weve found is that the more time you give the students the more time they have to see minneapolis in ways you might not want them to see minneapolis
8132931 we really thought about how we can get the students on campus give them the content they need and help them make the connections without it being a drinking fest
8132932 dorms food service transportation this all has to be paid for
8132933 its related to graduation because its going to connect students much earlier on with the array of opportunities they can have culturally socially or academically at the university that engagement and as quick as you can do it is really key to success in college today
8132934 research shows that the more the student is involved and engaged in student activities in leadership positions the better theyll do in their academic work and the sooner theyll graduate
8132935 thats not always self evident but we want to introduce them to these opportunities so maybe theyll realize gee maybe i should balance some of these outside the classroom opportunities
8132936 we came to this city not looking for this type of trouble
8132937 what we have is a bunch of thugs running around with badges
8132938 while i still want to get all of the details this certainly sets the wrong tone for the convention
8132939 were not trying to infringe on anybodys rights we still have a job to do if youre coming out of a railroad yard youre trespassing
8132940 they are wrong we were not in a rail yard
8132941 vi njuter av att ha sex inf r fr mlingar
8132942 my goal is to do well to pay back all the people who stood by me and believed in me
8132943 you dream of it but so many things can go wrong
8132944 you just hope that your horse comes up big on the biggest day and mine sure did hes one of a kind
8132945 he felt really good in the first round and was still fresh in the second round
8132946 he is a careful horse and when you need to leave the rails up you can count on him he makes my job easy it is an honour
8132947 hopefully i will speak about this for the last time
8132948 you cant come back in the sport without great support from your friends family and owners and they supported me and made it impossible for me not to try the past is the past if this doesnt make people forgive and stop talking about it i dont know what will
8132949 hes the best in the world and the horse is one of the best in the world
8132950 for the rest of us you have hopes but you keep it well controlled
8132951 but the stars all have to be aligned no matter how good you are
8132952 weve been kind of looked at as a second class sport
8132953 the more depth you have the better teams youll have in the future
8132954 mac has always been a real steady rider on our team

8132966 as you may already know on thursday april 24 i was brutally assaulted by three individuals
8132967 the apd proposed that i submit to a polygraph which is highly unheard of that a victim of a violent assault be requested to do so even with the audacity of the request i intended to comply but a lawyer intervened and suggested further counsel the evils of prejudice racial biases and hate manifested themselves repeatedly and in some very unexpected paces but our voices calling for justice can be louder and stronger when i shared with many of you that the attackers corroborated a story saying i chased them you forwarded letter after letter from pa all the way to ga confirming my character truthfulness and integrity these notarized letters have aided in further proving that the attackers accusations can be nothing more than a corroborated lie to defend their barbaric actions and stand in strong contrast to the apds questioning my credibility please continue to furnish these letters as the difference is made when more people speak up

8132999 a spectator in the crowd at the equestrian venue held up a sign that read lamazing i think that describes his performance perfectly
8133000 the township supported the building of this 18 hole golf course and its buildings and infrastructure around it but what was not take into consideration was its water use
8133001 i believe this golf course is infringing on the oak ridges moraines environment
8133002 cardinal golf course only uses canal water which is located on their property
8133003 in no way does it take its water from the moraine
8133004 i think its a good idea that the staff makes sure that the golf course is really getting its source of water from another revenue
8133005 im really happy with my performance as i completed my routines both very well
8133006 overall i accomplished my goals and im happy with how well i did

8133075 the god who made the world and everything in it is the lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands
8133076 therefore since we are gods offspring we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone an image made by mans design and skill 30 in the past god overlooked such ignorance but now he commands all people everywhere to repent 31 for he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed he has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead

8133126 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8133127 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8133128 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8133129 she did a great job i think she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election she was outstanding
8133130 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8133131 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8133132 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8133133 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8133134 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8133135 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8133136 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
8133137 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8133138 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8133139 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8133140 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8133141 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8133142 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8133143 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8133144 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8133145 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8133146 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8133147 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8133148 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8133149 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8133150 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8133151 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8133152 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away

8133168 the man used two types of scams to extort 10 000 from her in one scam he emailed her a business letter identifying us 200 000 he had deposited in a us bank account
8133169 he stated that he needed a uk bank account in order to release his us funds the woman paid 3000 to open an account in london transferring the funds to nigeria

8133172 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8133173 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8133174 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8133175 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8133176 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8133177 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8133183 indeed some may regard that as provocative i dont think it helps circumstances in georgia and i dont think it helps relationships generally between russia and the rest of the world

8133186 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8133187 obviously this is a matter in front of the privileges committee theres a conflict of evidence the committee is in the middle of a process no doubt theyll wish to hear from mr peters and i think the matters really best left with the privileges committee to pursue at the moment
8133188 i think we really need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8133189 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8133190 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand
8133191 winstons in a spot now where the whole world is wrong and only winston is right im afraid its winston peters credibility that has been shot to bits
8133192 our parking lots are full even on nice sunny days were very proud of that
8133193 this park and zoo not only does its part in preserving open space and wetlands in an area where that is shrinking its also always been a place where families can come and enjoy an entire day together without spending very much
8133194 i dont think that even covers the enjoyment we get out of coming here
8133195 you may hear more about zoos like the san diego zoo or the bronx but its really in many small and medium sized zoos like cape may countys where important works like the bongo repatriation project are going on
8133196 its within these smaller facilities that the expertise and the care for these kinds of projects resides
8133197 i brought my kids here when they were little and now theyre 34 and i bring my grandchildren here i cant believe what they started with and now what they have here now you could spend all day

8133210 as most people know usually by personal experience modern u s health care is hugely expensive and does not always assure safety
8133211 what were doing is exploring virtual worlds and ubiquitous computing that is the not so utopian and imminent world in which everything including objects is alive by virtue of being connected to a network as a model for efficient operations the ultimate goal is to move beyond modeling so that these systems may actually be used as tools in real hospitals real pharmacies and clinics and other care facilities
8133212 in the everything is alive vision objects talk to each other
8133213 our virtual objects do this and increasingly so can wirelessly connected real world objects so its time to generate a rich collection of vignettes or workflows that exercise this capability to understand it better for example well work on a situation in which a blood pressure machine interacts intelligently with an iv drip so that the latter can adjust appropriately based on information received from the former all of this can happen without fallible humans manually controlling both machines
8133214 some argue that my students and i are just having fun that we could model all of these things in older technologies such as queuing theory
8133215 my response is yes we are having fun and were beginning to see how virtual worlds excel in providing users with understandable simulations of business practices if the real world is moving toward identity management technologies like rfid to keep track of things we can get there first in a virtual world analyze business situations and then optimize to make them safer and less expensive
8133216 one of the most profound and important victories available under our system of justice

8133219 we have a 1982 easement with peco energy from township line road in cromby up to fricks lock
8133220 from fricks lock north is where we are negotiating with landowners
8133221 our goal is to sign it uniformly and find access points and trailheads
8133222 thats important when you have a regional trail with thousands of visitors a day
8133223 this is a world war ii battleship with high fixed costs for maintenance and theres the cost of running the museum and utilities 720 000 a year its an expensive place to run
8133224 for the 3 million the state was getting back 9 2 million in economic impact
8133225 if the state wants to see vibrant cultural and historical museums in the state theres a level of support thats needed
8133226 each of these sites and activities are equally important to fueling the states economy
8133227 the liberty science center in jersey city was cut by 2 7 million and the newark museum lost 2 2 million
8133228 the goal of the budget was to take steps to fix state finances so we could match recurring spending with recurring revenues reduce state debt and ease the structural budget shortfall
8133229 the focus was to preserve core programs that service our seniors and other vulnerable populations
8133230 we are dependent on the states help so this is a big blow to us
8133231 its been a rough month we will have to do a better job of bringing in more money well have to work harder
8133232 we will have to handle tasks in much different ways assess operational priorities we will probably have some limited hours during the winter we will still have groups and encampments for a day
8133233 we are not a philadelphia based museum with main line support from wealthy contributors
8133234 were hoping for 5 000 people and we want the mood to be thoroughly democratic and we want the peopl to feel inspired about voting for candidates who actually represent them

8133237 ive had a chance to play and be healthy so im excited to be here
8133238 for an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this
8133239 being a u s based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8133240 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8133241 mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
8133242 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8133243 but we have reached out to others who are not korean and other international players and impressed upon them the need to speak english and the requirements of this policy players have been very supportive of it

8133248 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8133249 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8133250 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8133251 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8133266 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8133267 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8133268 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8133269 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8133270 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8133271 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8133272 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8133273 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8133274 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8133275 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8133276 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8133277 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8133278 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8133279 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8133280 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

8133283 as a democrat i hope mccain doesnt pick a woman vp
8133284 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8133285 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8133286 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8133287 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8133288 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8133289 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8133290 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8133291 nanti kinerja pdam tiap 6 bulan akan diperiksa kan pmk berlaku mulai 31 juli 2008 tiap 6 bulan sekali akan diperiksa dan akan diumumakan evaluasinya kepada masyarakat

8133294 professor durdik brings years of experience in grant writing and success in gaining significant funding to the position
8133295 she is on a peer review committee for the national institutes of health and has been an ad hoc reviewer for major professional journals and national grant panels in addition her research is currently receiving major funding from the national institutes of health
8133296 i recall that my doctoral committee had to sign off that i had contributed to the knowledge of the world
8133297 as associate dean for research i intend to help our faculty make that contribution that little word for carries the meaning of my job and defines my priorities the work of scientists is ultimately for the world for everything from the effort to preserve rare species to mapping the human genome and creating new scientific devices using completely novel complex nanostructures
8133298 eliminating the evening meal in cafes frequented by nontechnical employees
8133299 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8133300 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8133301 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8133302 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8133303 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8133304 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8133305 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8133306 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8133307 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8133308 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8133309 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8133310 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8133311 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8133312 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8133313 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8133314 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8133315 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8133316 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8133317 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8133318 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8133319 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8133320 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8133321 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8133322 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8133323 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8133324 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8133325 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8133326 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8133327 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8133328 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8133329 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8133330 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8133331 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8133332 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8133333 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8133334 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8133335 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8133336 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8133337 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8133338 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8133339 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8133340 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8133341 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8133342 i would say that meth is very largely controlled by white supremacists
8133343 it is notorious for being produced by white supremacists it is a rural white working class phenomenon they have a huge chunk of the market
8133344 its not the aryan nations and the national socialist who are getting this money they meth makers tend to be criminal enterprises such as white nationalist biker gangs and prison gangs like aryan brotherhood i dont think the meth is bringing in a lot of money to the klan
8133345 the white nationalist movement in general is absolutely shot through with drugs meth in particular it is really kind of a sick little inside joke
8133346 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8133347 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8133348 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8133349 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8133350 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8133351 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8133352 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8133353 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8133354 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8133355 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8133356 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8133357 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8133358 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8133359 who are open to doing something on the production side
8133360 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8133361 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8133362 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8133363 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8133364 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8133365 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8133366 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8133367 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8133368 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8133369 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8133370 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8133371 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8133372 but you cant test us on material we havent covered it isnt fair

8133406 god has willed that each of us give until there is nothing else to give you see all of creation all the world all mankind benefits or loses out because of you youve got to understand what it means to love as jesus loved
8133407 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8133408 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8133409 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8133410 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8133411 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8133412 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8133413 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8133414 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8133415 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8133416 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8133417 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8133418 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8133419 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom

8133423 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8133424 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8133425 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8133426 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8133427 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8133428 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

8133437 nel corso degli ultimi tre anni spiega la ricerca con riferimento a un paniere di prodotti orticoli costruito in modo omogeneo la differenza tra il prezzo alla produzione e quello allingrosso risulta in italia superiore al 100 contro un valore mediamente del 60 in spagna e in francia
8133438 in questa fase per litalia si legge nello studio utilizzando i dati dellistituto di servizi per il mercato agricolo alimentare ismea si osserva un incremento medio di prezzo superiore al 50 nel complesso dal produttore al consumatore il ricarico totale del comparto e mediamente del 200
8133439 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
8133440 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
8133441 a causa dellelevata stagionalit e deperibilit dei prodotti o a fronte di una scarsa organizzazione della produzione agricola
8133442 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
8133443 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
8133444 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
8133445 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo e antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale
8133446 il complesso dei mercati allingrosso si presenta insufficiente a trattare unofferta agricola rilevante ridistribuendola verso altri mercati di sbocco

8133473 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8133474 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8133475 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8133476 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8133477 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8133478 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8133479 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8133480 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8133481 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8133483 here is a bottle of water this is either the love of jesus coming from the body of christ or its just a bottle of water or its something in between that whatever it is to you here you go
8133484 im sorry that you assume that as a person with a church that i have to fit into one of those two categories people like me christians weve earned your distrust and you have every right to think and say whatever you want about me for what its worth im sorry weve sinned against god and against you weve failed to be who we have been called to be that said i cant fit what we think into a thirty second sound bite i can honestly say that i dont fit into either of those categories i dont think i even know what gay fully means but i do know this there are infinitely more important things about you than who youre attracted to i reject the idea in our culture that who we are is intrinsically tied to what we do with our genitals and who we do it with that is not the defining characteristic of a human being because long before you or i are gay or straight or whatever labels we accept we are a unique creation of the living god we are also incredibly broken people in an incredibly broken world and the fact that we have to have this conversation is testament to the fact that we have no clue how to live with each other let alone god and i believe that jesus was god who came here to save us in every way that we need to be saved and what you do with jesus is way more important than what you do with anything else i believe jesus knew you were worth dying for and in the light of that what i think is sort of irrelevant but in the midst of our inability to live together well we want to bring water and i dont know if youre gay or straight but i know youre thirsty its a hot day pro gay church anti gay church i dont know today were an anti thirst church just for right now in this moment can that be enough

8133492 i wanted someone to come in who had worked on cases
8133493 quite honestly we probably cant answer their questions that night
8133494 the trend in e giving is a cultural move as fewer people of the younger generations carry cash
8133495 we live in a plastic online banking world where growing numbers of people prefer to exchange funds electronically rather than carry a checkbook or cash
8133496 back in 2000 just one third of protestant churches 34 percent had a church website
8133497 that exploded to 57 percent in 2005 and has inched upward since then to 62 percent
8133498 churches are exploring the theory that people who give electronically may tend to give more consistently because giving occurs even when the church member is not present at church on sunday
8133499 the most popular types of e giving are credit debit cards recurring electronic funds transfer from an established checking or savings account or private booths set up in the church foyer for members to give before or after the worship service
8133500 people are so used to doing everything online so it was a natural progression
8133501 people are more mobile now they travel more or are on the road working
8133502 the most important thing is the attitude of your heart whenever you give
8133503 online giving is just a different method of supporting the church through tithes and offerings
8133504 we wanted to offer online giving for people already using online banking and the internet for bookkeeping to make it easier for them
8133505 our only reservation was that for some people giving during the service is an act of worship those using automatic withdrawal can still participate in the offering time by placing an envelope in the offering plate that is marked that they contributed online
8133506 is that we do not charge setup or monthly service fees for our existing customers dealing with one vendor for offering envelope and e giving solutions simplifies the giving process for both the church member and church leader
8133507 how has music changed in the last 50 years and how will it change in the next 50 years to what extent does that affect our choirs
8133508 the percentage of people in your church who have ever been in a choir is at the highest it will ever be
8133509 we are going to have to work harder to recruit people
8133510 choirs can stir more passion than just one person alone and often more than a praise team can
8133511 the choir is a strong testimony to the congregation because the choir represents the greatest cross section of your congregation
8133512 choirs also give worship leaders the opportunity to involve more people in leading worship
8133513 and its almost impossible to duplicate the energy that a large group of excited people brings to a service
8133514 the cultures changing and it will be challenging to grow a choir
8133515 but there is value in having a large group leading worship
8133516 rich people constantly learn and grow poor people think they already know
8133517 the effective read and grow the apathetic think they already know
8133518 and jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man
8133519 and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers
8133520 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
8133521 cant you buy shoes that would allow for the same kind of sensation
8133522 yeah but they dont look as cool and besides i skated for almost three hours without falling once
8133523 how many times have i told you not to talk on the cell phone when youre using the chain saw
8133524 i love you and theres nothing you can do about it
8133525 im a little blown away by this whole thing because it just started i think we ought to leave it the way it was constructed and see how well it performs
8133526 the attitude says we only want iconoclastic art that will wow the nation
8133527 but once you start reducing and tearing the program apart theres nothing really left
8133528 lets give it a chance lets see how well or how poorly we do and go from there
8133529 theyre looking to get more funding theyre not looking to cut
8133530 you dont have to like the arts personally but you have to acknowledge the economic development power the arts can bring to the metropolitan area
8133531 what were trying to do is take some of the mystery out of public art because it is a topic conflicted with politics money and taste
8133532 but at the same time i think we have a responsibility to do more with the money

8133538 ini untukmu sudah lama sepertinya aku ingin menyerahkannya kepadamu dan sekarang sepertinya saat yang tepat
8133539 tanyaku sesaat setelah kita saling bertegur sapa kebetulan hari itu engkau ada ngga sopan tapi biarlah cinta telah mengalahkan logika bahkan pikiran waras sekalipun

8133546 recently i was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook off the original person called in sick at the last moment and i happened to be standing there at the judges table asking for directions to the coors light truck when the call came in i was assured by the other two judges native texans that the chili wouldnt be all that spicy and besides they told me i could have free beer during the tasting so i accepted and became judge 3
8133547 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him i know him and i believe that as president hell pursue the common good by seeking common ground rather than trying to divide us
8133548 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
8133549 a recent study by the university of pennsylvanias national annenberg election survey which said young viewers of
8133550 viewers of jon stewarts show are more likely to have completed four years of college than people who watch
8133551 pew research center study showing the network has the most balanced audience in cable news 39 percent republicans and 33 percent democrats
8133552 but being out of touch with mainstream america is nothing new to jon as evidenced by the crash and burn ratings of this years oscars telecast
8133553 fairly allowing everyone to watch and being watched near equally among people of both left and right wing political stances
8133554 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8133555 he said that disciplining of a dog by way of a beating is not abnormal or seen as abusive in his country
8133556 i would be amazed if chinese people thought it was culturally proper to beat dogs i give you no credit for that because i dont accept its a fact
8133557 we are prepared to invest a decent sum if it proves to be what customers want
8133558 we realise we need a larger physical footprint for our banking business and this is a way to address it
8133559 while people love internet banking there is still a segment who much prefer to deal face to face with someone
8133560 even for those who love internet banking there are certain transactions where they want to sit down with someone and check it through for example mortgages investment advice and insurance
8133561 its a great example of the trusted co op developing its brand
8133562 i think the initiative will lead to greater cross selling of products and services and provide greater convenience for the customers which will lead to even greater loyalty

8133572 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8133573 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8133574 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8133575 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8133594 knitters and crocheters are dedicated and generous and are known for rising to this type of challenge
8133595 is that the scarves are knitted or crocheted by hand using delft blue 885 and white 311 red heart super saver yarn because these colors perfectly match the special olympics logo and were chosen specifically by the world winter games organizers

8133598 further examples in which lack of defragmentation in some linux filesystems such as ext3 is a serious issue includes server applications where rapid concurrent and random file creation update or access occurs such systems include large scale carrier grade voice mail systems media messaging service centers mmscs and sms smscs short message service centers servers media servers such as large scale voice mail and ums servers are required to stream hundreds of voice or video streams concurrently to hundreds of users in near real time conditions these types of applications are particularly susceptible to file fragmentation access delays during playback of a voice e g voice mail or video file due to multiple fragmentation in the media file can lead to playback interruption or distortion as fragmentation increases over time service capacity of these systems degrades because of increased cpu and i o overhead resulting from fragmentation induced disk thrashing
8133599 being able to use more than 4gb of ram on a 32 bit pc requires support for pae in the os kernel microsoft has only supported this extra ram in its enterprise datacenter and 64 bit versions of windows the standard 32 bit versions of windows xp vista and windows server are all still constrained to using 4gb of physical ram
8133600 currently mac os x leopard hosts both 32 bit and 64 bit apps on top of a 32 bit kernel using pae the 32 bit kernel can address 32gb of ram in the mac pro and xserve apples consumer machines only support 4gb ram

8133604 until very recently confidence levels among local businesses seemed to be holding up reasonably well
8133605 indeed there were certainly arguments in some quarters at the beginning of the year that it was primarily the city of london that had been caught in the eye of the economic storm and that the rest of the british economy might escape relatively unscathed
8133606 however theres now no denying that businesses in the north west are feeling the impact of this so called perfect storm of rising inflation tightening credit conditions and reduced consumer confidence clearly some sectors are feeling this more than others
8133607 when you add to this the fact that nobody really knows how long all this is going to last some predictors have said 2009 while others have indicated a much longer term it is no surprise that local management are cautious
8133608 we have learnt from previous difficult economic periods that a business as usual strategy is simply the wrong approach
8133609 those businesses which tackle the issues head on will stand a greater chance of emerging from this part of the economic cycle in a stronger more competitive position
8133610 business sentiment and consumer confidence fell sharply in the past three months more so than in any other region
8133611 this seemed to reflect an extremely sharp rise in costs the highest in the uk which firms struggled to pass on
8133612 despite this both the volume of new orders and the volume of output picked up although by less than expected in the previous survey
8133613 one of the strengths of greater manchesters economy is its sheer diversity and the feedback that im getting at the moment is that some retailers are having a tough time
8133614 but other companies in the service and manufacturing sectors remain busy
8133615 not all businesses will be adversely affected by the downturn ranging from career and coaching advisers to low price supermarkets such as lidl
8133616 however most businesses will be affected and its essential for them to take a close look at the balance sheet and cash flow and to take into account how the recession is affecting their customers cash flow
8133617 in any recession its also very important not to lose sight of the long term this will vary with the business but cutting staff development budgets or the marketing budget can prove a false economy the economy goes in cycles and any business has to be ready to capitalise on the upturn
8133618 the original store was one of our first generation outlets which served us very well but had become too small and was looking pretty tired
8133619 in the new stores we are seeing existing customers buying more goods but we are also attracting new shoppers from a wider area
8133620 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8133621 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8133622 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8133623 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8133624 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8133625 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8133626 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8133663 the blog at least helps people see how we think about it
8133664 thats the importance of public relations of advertising of everything we do
8133665 it is the virtual substitute for bill marriott visiting every hotel
8133666 anybody that weve hired in the past couple of years i think any of them would tell you that they read the blog heavily to get a sense of our people
8133667 its a small business so we dont have a marketing budget
8133668 weve never done any ads or promoting because we cant afford it so i guess its kind of guerrilla marketing and its free
8133669 i think that the really important thing about using a blog as a business strategy is that usually you cannot connect the dots directly from blogs to revenue
8133670 make sure that the blog fits in with the existing culture of the company
8133671 sint aproape convinsa ca degete mici e cartea pe care filip florian a ales o dintre cele pe care le a scris pina acum ca s o dea spre publicare altfel de unde constructia impecabila tonul sigur personajele rotunde si mai ales o limba romaneasca pe cit de fireasca pe atit de ironic sedimentata toate acestea pentru cristalizarea unei frumoase povesti despre vina si greseala despre umbrele inselatoare ale trecutului personal si istoric o poveste despre destin si amor lumesc sau ceresc recunosc sint entuziasmata

8133706 while earlier one could say that the modernisation process was hindered by the lack of funds this was not the case today it is for the industry to step forward and take up the challenge
8133707 if we are to meet our goal of strategic self reliance
8133708 the emerging service requirements the economic environment and government policies have created a great opportunity for the industry
8133709 if we succeed in establishing a firm foundation today our aerospace capability would jump a generation ahead
8133710 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8133711 therapeutic compositions and methods useful in modulating protein tyrosine phosphatases
8133712 based on lenoctas demonstrated anti tumor activity against melanoma renal cancer prostate cancer leukemia and other cancers both alone and in combination with other approved immune activation agents including il 2 and interferons we believe this product candidate represents a promising approach to treating cancer
8133713 we are also enthusiastic about the new fda priority review voucher program which could enable us to accelerate development and commercialization efforts for lenocta in the treatment of leishmaniasis
8133714 its important to remember that there are real people and families behind these statistics
8133715 the new census figures are a reminder of how important it is to ensure that all americans have access to affordable health coverage
8133716 nearly 46 million americans have no health coverage and remain vulnerable to financial disaster if a serious illness or accident strikes
8133717 this report shows how critical medicaid medicare and schip are in providing a safety net to americans who cant afford health coverage especially during tough economic times
8133718 i never actually said i would sell my vote what i was saying was theres no reason for me to vote for any candidate that s not ready to commit to my community
8133719 real commitment for the dnc and the various candidates to take a real commitment to the latino vote
8133720 we hispanics are severely underrepresented in terms of voter registration s and the numbers have been going down steadily since 1968
8133721 im a yellow dog democrat that means ill vote for a three legged mangy one eyed flea bitten dog before i vote for a republican and thats what people here need to understand
8133722 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes
8133723 a normal process programmed cell death causes a normal response
8133724 but it does this in such a way that in a small subset of the population it starts them on the road to type 1 diabetes
8133725 hes nervous because hes the kind of guy that wants everyone to be pleased with his performance starting with himself hes a perfectionist
8133726 but i think when it comes down to the concepts that our people have asked him to understand the true xs and os that people have asked him to understand i think hes done an excellent job
8133727 a tremendous athlete someone whos willing to learn hes humble now
8133728 we had to show him a little bit that this is a different level and everybody starts from the bottom
8133729 i usually challenged him and talked junk he got mad a few times
8133730 i wouldnt hit him the way to test somebodys humbleness or where they are mentally is to challenge them verbally to see how they can handle people coming at them and how they handle pressure in a game a lot of guys talk junk you have to be able to just take it in stride and keep your cool at first he had a little trouble with it but hes fine now
8133731 the seniors must get after him pretty good because every once in a while ill get a text from him saying are we supposed to get up at 5 30 or is this another senior prank on me
8133732 the number one killer among people with kidney disease is heart disease just like in the rest of the population except that in people with kidney disease the heart disease exhibits an accelerated course
8133733 kidney disease puts a person at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular disease but it is often asymptomatic even as late as stage three
8133734 the more definitively we can characterize renal disease the closer we are to effectively treating both it and its comorbid conditions
8133735 our participants experiences show that offering staff a life of meaning can be a powerful tool for recruitment that appeals to both millennials and baby boomers
8133736 we give our employees and recruits numerous opportunities to hear about the organizations values and discuss whether we are living up to them this has made a huge difference for us in attracting and retaining a workforce
8133737 creo que deber an pronosticar sus propios problemas que han sido importantes
8133738 adem s de no haber pronosticado su propia situaci n como pa s cuando uno mira el informe del banco central de espa a sobre la argentina en enero y abril de 2001 advierte claramente que en realidad el an lisis y las predicciones en econom a no son el fuerte de la gente que realiza este tipo de an lisis
8133739 una parte del informe de enero de 2001 unos nueve o diez meses antes de la peor crisis de argentina dec a que en este pa s si bien la actividad econ mica permanece d bil las perspectivas para el futuro han mejorado sensiblemente tras la instrumentaci n del paquete de ayuda del fondo monetario internacional en 2000
8133740 m s tarde continu mucho m s cerca del incendio en abril de 2001 destacaba que despu s de un per odo de turbulencias pol ticas el gobierno argentino ha conseguido la aprobaci n de un ambicioso plan que persigue un cu druple objetivo reactivar la econom a cumplir compromisos fiscales ligados a la ayuda del fmi equilibrar el saldo exterior y recuperar la confianza de los inversores y prestamistas internacionales
8133741 esto revela dos cosas o que bien no hacen an lisis demasiado acertados o bien los an lisis son absolutamente interesados
8133742 se estaba planteando la operaci n del megacanje de t tulos p blicos que constituy una formidable maniobra de asientos contables para que los capitales que hab an especulado durante d cadas en argentina pudieran retirarse sostenidos por los propios dineros de los argentinos y tuvieron como mo o la derogaci n de la ley de subversi n econ mica
8133743 si esto pudiera analizarse en el marco de lo que era la ley de subversi n econ mica y las maniobras que significaron para recuperar los fondos especulativos que hab an ingresado al pa s realmente le pusieron el mo o a una historia tr gica para todos los argentinos
8133744 habla de la falta de seriedad y fundamentalmente de la irresponsabilidad con que se abordan temas que muchas veces deciden inversiones y en definitiva la vida de todos los argentinos

8133766 because shes treating me like some psych patient and i dont deserve that
8133767 but just me you are a psych patient you maybe havent upset her before but the way the secretary presented the message would be a very typical frustrating behavior
8133768 she did a great job i think she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election she was outstanding

8133775 today five months after we met with the biggest general election loss in our history umno has suffered a landslide loss at permatang pauh this despite the mobilization of the entire leadership and resources of a party that has held the machinery of government without pause for 50 years
8133776 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8133777 and the rest of his statement our leadership is rejected by the rakyat and moreover is rejected by our own members bns vote count was less than the number of umno members in the constituency within and among our component parties we ran a poorly coordinated and listless campaign against a motivated opposition what scraps of credibility the prime minister and his deputy had left after march 8 are gone todays report card delivered to a prime minister who is accountable also as liaison chief of umno penang and chairman of bn is impossible to hide he does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world he may not have the credibility needed to keep the country together this dangerous situation cannot continue and it will not i appeal to the members of umno and of bns component parties to stand by umno in our hour of crisis and to take a sober historical perspective the people of malaysia and along with them umnos ordinary members have found their democratic voice they demand leadership that can be trusted to unite our people to restore confidence in our institutions and forge a clear national direction today is proof that this wave cannot be held back umno must change we must begin by renewing our party leadership i am confident that by december we shall
8133778 since the democrats seem to be trying to wrap their arms around this whole religion thing as witnessed last night at the convention lets be patient with them

8133789 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8133790 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8133791 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions
8133792 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
8133793 ive seen a lot of marriages that dont work with buddies of mine that are in the pros or have played in the pros i felt like a lot of those guys got into relationships they werent ready for i would think why is he doing that you know hes not ready then it would end up not working so i figured i wasnt about to go through all that for what by staying single ive saved a whole lot of money i didnt have to play any divorce settlements no child support i know guys that pay 20 000 or 10 000 a month in child support thats expensive man and there are a lot of women with ulterior motives too lets be real theyre looking for a security blanket straight up

8133798 its like putting expensive swiss seats in a generic car and then selling it as swiss made
8133799 at least 50 percent of the value of a watch movement must be manufactured in switzerland for the product to qualify as swiss made
8133800 movement typically makes up only 15 percent to 20 percent of a watchs value
8133801 less than 10 percent of the value of a watch qualifying as swiss made might have been added in switzerland
8133802 that at least 60 percent of a watchs value be created in switzerland
8133803 hurt swiss quality because some producers would resort to cheaper foreign made parts thereby raising the relative value of the swiss produced components
8133804 rather than tightening regulation switzerlands watch industry should be more preoccupied with quality
8133805 why not for instance agree that every swiss produced watch should be water resistant and superaccurate
8133806 many swiss producers would cut down on watch parts imported from asia and use more swatch group made items

8133813 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8133814 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8133815 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8133816 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8133817 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8133818 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8133819 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8133820 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8133835 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed we conducted a study into the way fingerprints can corrode metal surfaces
8133836 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8133837 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8133838 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8133839 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8133840 the situation throughout the valley was incident free as curfew restrictions continue without any relaxation we are assessing the situation constantly

8133886 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene

8133888 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8133889 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8133893 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8133894 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8133895 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8133896 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8133897 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

8133901 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8133902 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8133911 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno

8133921 each heart knows its own bitterness and no one else can share its joy
8133922 there is no plan as yet to remove security from the chinese embassy the high security at the place will continue
8133923 however after the olympics have ended there is a definite reduction in the number of police personnel guarding the area
8133924 the security cannot be removed as yet tibetan activists are not going to sit back quietly after the conclusion of the olympics
8133925 the beijing paralympic games are going to take place shortly after that talks will take place between chinese government and the representatives of the dalai lama keeping both these in view security cannot be relaxed at the embassy
8133926 as of now we dont plan any protests or campaigns anywhere in the city but we are conducting meetings and any action would be taken only after that
8133927 orders for phased relaxation of curfew have been issued to all the district magistrates of the valley the decision was taken tuesday evening at a high level meet chaired by governor n n vohra
8133928 the district magistrates will decide the timing for curfew relaxation in consultation with the security forces in order to ensure that the people can move about without any hindrance during the relaxation period
8133929 it depends upon the law and order situation in the area during the curfew relaxation period
8133930 there is no doubt in our mind as to who this belonged to
8133931 chief lacroix was never suspected to have possessed this with the intention of using it
8133932 i want to make it very clear that throughout my more than 36 year career as a firefighter i have never imperiled the safety of newton firefighters or the general public by using or possessing illegal drugs
8133933 a lot of people here have been very supportive by getting the testing done it takes a lot of pressure off them
8133934 i have every reason to believe chief lacroix had no knowledge that there were illicit drugs in his city vehicle
8133935 in todays society there is a vast majority of families that are infected by this problem my family is not immune to that
8133936 the message wasnt getting home so we had to take it to another step
8133937 i am a little disappointed in some of the firefighters who fostered the story in a negative way
8133938 its a family matter and a deep personal matter and i am disappointed that some did not have trust in me
8133939 ive been as open as i possibly can and i dont believe i have done anything wrong other than maybe i should have called the police up front
8133940 i want to make it clear that chief lacroix is being treated and will continue to be treated no differently than any other city employee would be treated under these circumstances
8133941 firefighters should be held on an upper plateau anyone in public safety is held at a higher standard there is a public trust that goes with that and we should not betray that public trust
8133942 drug use is a disease in todays society it happens so frequently if it goes unchecked its just going to spread
8133943 im going to be honest with you i dont think we can ever go back to the moody street of old
8133944 right now im trying to organize with other people on moody and main street
8133945 now what people are asking for is a little diversification
8133946 i cant whip you up an afternoon three course tea to go
8133947 i think anyone would like to see more retail but i think people need to think about what they mean by that
8133948 its much easier to get a higher quality of tenant in a new retail space
8133949 when polaroid is developed that could further hurt the downtown area

8133960 terence was a great kid very personable and a great athlete
8133961 after talking to him and realizing he wanted to hang out with his friends more he went back out for football his junior year
8133962 terence was a football player that ran track not a track runner that played football
8133963 the easiest thing to say is that you saw a guy that can run extremely fast
8133964 more importantly he had that willingness coming out of high school to do things the appropriate way
8133965 he knew it was significant for him to work as hard as he could to embrace and to learn as much as he could
8133966 he was a great learner and he trusted the system
8133967 speed was obviously important with every position that he was involved with and we wanted to utilize the speed that young people have
8133968 between his sophomore and junior year terence was a permanent symbol in our weight room because he wanted it more than anyone
8133969 the humility that terence has allows him to understand that there is always more to learn and improve
8133970 the most significant thing one can do is not put himself in a closet where you feel youve accomplished it all
8133971 as american has herpes and hot dogs got lost between the mustard and hot sauce unprotected sex with that one you just met you aint even got all your hep shots yet
8133972 it went right in the garage and it burst and the fire started
8133973 it was all red and i was in such shock
8133974 i followed the smoke and it was out the back of a house it must have been their shed or balcony or something
8133975 the people had just come out of their house not even about five minutes later the fire brigade and police rocked up and it was a bit hard to believe
8133976 at this stage we dont know what the flights were but its likely they were training flights
8133977 both aircraft were operated by the royal victorian aero club which obviously is a major flight training organisation
8133978 this is a fabrication by the sudanese government and some criminals
8133979 we denounce and condemn this act we want the protection of civilians wherever they are this is a dirty conspiracy to defame

8133982 barring three incidents of curfew violations by small groups of stone pelting people at bemina chowk in srinagar city and achabal and dooru towns of anantnag district there was complete calm in the valley
8133983 the situation was incident free we are assessing the situation for cyclic relaxation of curfew at many places wednesday but that depends upon how the law and order situation behaves

8133986 on the day of judgment we shall set up scales of justice so that no one will be dealt with unjustly in any way even if someone has an act as small as a grain of a mustard seed we will bring it to account and sufficient are we to settle the accounts
8133987 on the day of judgment we shall set up scales gt of justice so that no one will be dealt with unjustly in any way gt even if someone has an act as small as a grain of a mustard seed we gt will gt bring it to account and sufficient are we to settle the accounts
8133988 im a strong believer i think she must have had a guardian angel im so happy
8133989 i couldnt believe it but when i got down there i knew it was my cat because they all have their own voice
8133990 they identify lonely vulnerable people and then request money from them with false promises of marriage or the release of vast sums of money at a later date
8133991 the connor brothers live modest lives gleaning joy from simple pleasures drinking joking with the foulmouthed girleen tormenting father welsh and fighting with each other constantly and brutally when in an attempt to salvage their relationship they confess all to each other the results are explosive
8133992 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
8133993 there is no denying that the web has improved the way we do business but recognition of the potential problem the web might bring through misuse is the biggest hurdle to overcome organizations failing to implement reliable monitoring and reporting tools will never really know how much it is costing them
8133994 holds enormous potential for improving the management of large enterprises
8133995 vaya tela no me lo creo aqu estamos con la bandera de nuestro equipo quien nos lo iba a decir sali perfecto era el sitio ideal
8133996 by golly its looking pretty darn good it may not be the best crop weve ever cut but its right up there were excited about the price of course that always helps when you get a good price for the work you do yeah its looking pretty good
8133997 i was surprised and pleased about the attention people paid him i think a lot of people it sort of brought tears to their eyes because whether they agree with him or not he certainly has been tenacious and has battled a lot of not only personal tragedy and has put his public service in front of that so it was a very touching couple of minutes when he was on stage

8134001 race for the future and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8134002 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8134003 folks always ask me whats my biggest criticism of president bush im sure you all have your own heres mine its not just the policy differences its the fact that this president never tapped into our greatest resources the character and resolve of the american people he never really asked us to step up
8134004 a plan that would explode the deficit and leave that to our kids no real strategy to invest in our infrastructure and he would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq i dont know about you but thats just not right thats four more years that we just cant afford
8134005 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter whether its got a d or an r next to it because this election isnt about liberal vs conservative its not about left vs right its about the future vs the past
8134006 thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president
8134007 because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear

8134020 its such an international game that the opportunities to play rugby around the world are great
8134021 i cant imagine anything better over the next four to five years than maybe to end up in japan or wales or italy or france
8134022 whether i get on the field or not ive had a great ride over the last 10 seasons
8134023 theres been great support too i think im going to be more emotional about the support ive had from all the fans and from family
8134024 clinton toopi and i couldnt believe it we were hugging and jumping around grand final week was probably the best experience of my life
8134025 i havent been able to find my groove and i dont blame anyone else for me not playing well
8134026 unfortunately i had a couple of bad runs with injuries i got a few opportunities to stamp my position but i couldnt do it
8134027 they were on the flight with us and part of the team
8134028 i havent spoken to them but they know there are consequences to actions
8134029 it is a silly thing a bit of tomfoolery which went a step too far
8134030 it was a great team to be part of which was why that was a disappointment because it was a team that respected supported one another and overwhelmingly it was
8134031 its a dampening on a very successful campaign but they have however been sanctioned by nzoc and they were suspended from the olympic team so protocols were fully followed
8134032 i responded to a media question around the situation they clearly knew what the situation was certainly the conversation wasnt made public by me
8134033 its a pretty small townhouse but its amazing what you can do without much space
8134034 the word commission has very specific meanings under state statutes
8134035 that word starts a clock with specific deadlines it also gives a group far more powers than the council wants us to have
8134036 the first thing we need to do is to see if we even need to change it
8134037 the connecticut conference of municipalities can help us with that
8134038 these upgrades will help us access power from farther away places
8134039 and whenever a market has that ability it makes everybody more competitive ideally holding prices down
8134040 but im frugal i dont run the air conditioner as much as i used to
8134041 there seems to be an idea rattling around driven by concerns about global warming that we need to stop building roads and using cars and take to public transport to save the planet
8134042 after the second world war we established a car industry and started developing new suburbs first at the end of our radial rail lines and more recently far beyond the reach of the rail and bus systems
8134043 it was not just transport it was fun now i calculate it costs me 6 for a round trip to werribee plaza
8134044 the japanese embassy in kabul continues to gather information through contacts with the afghan authorities
8134045 my wife is in shock because it was wrong for that reason alone i want accurate information
8134046 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8134047 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8134048 we need to elect barack obama because we need a president who understands that america cant compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas
8134049 barack obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy he built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up not the top down
8134050 he knows government must be about we the people not we the favored few
8134051 and when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8134052 as i recall we did it with president bill clinton and the democrats and we will do our part and will do it again with president obama and the democrats
8134053 i dont think we can continue with the schizophrenic view that we have today sort of part public company part private company where the leaders of the company do well when things are going well but then the government and the public and the taxpayer has to bail them out when it goes bad
8134054 the fact is that we have to have a clear definition of what the mission of freddie and fannie is and if it is to serve the public than it ought to be owned by the public where the risk and rewards are controlled by the public
8134055 no no no i love my job as governor of the state of new jersey
8134056 we are continuing to collect information through the afghan authorities but his safety has yet to be confirmed
8134057 we will do our best so that mr ito is rescued as soon as possible
8134058 hes in the clear and very happy about it we gave him a self testing kit to take away
8134059 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand his credibility has been shot to bits
8134060 it is because obama represents the change that needs to happen in this country
8134061 took a long time to get her name learned right too
8134062 its easy to think about people as assets resources to accomplish a goal because you dont have a personal relationship with an asset you dont care about an asset you dont miss the scent of an asset when she leaves the room

8134081 the workshop is specifically designed for people who are actively seeking to improve environmental and river health ev individual and group members waterkeeper members landcare members and anyone who is involved in working groups or stakeholder committees especially on water issues
8134082 almost every aspect of the work we all do to protect and restore our environment involves influencing people and negotiation to achieve our objectives
8134083 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the c02 released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the carbon stored in natural forests is a larger and more reliable stock than the carbon stored in commercially logged forests and plantations
8134084 as a gay man i know how it feels to be called hateful names simply because of who i am
8134085 i believe one of the unintended consequences of forbidding such words to be spoken is imbuing those words with more power than they should ever have and helping create the illusion that the bigotry and racism expressed by such cruel epithets is less prevalent than it actually is which we all know is sadly not the case
8134086 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him

8134092 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake

8134097 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destructions this is a guy who has destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
8134098 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target
8134099 strongly deplore the fact that this is not the first incident of this kind
8134100 that killing and maiming of civilians is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and human rights law
8134101 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8134102 ning n artista o sello se ha quejado el sitio no est cerrado indefinidamente estate atento
8134103 what happens after that is largely up to my colleagues
8134104 thats been the strength of the company but it is also its weakness because obviously no group of people can go on forever and there has to come a day when the group is no longer a cohesive group because one or more people have gone in other directions
8134105 i think at 20 years it is time for me to set the lead and say to the others you work out what you want to do after that
8134106 i reckon between now and 2010 we are going to have two of our best years
8134107 tony has done a fantastic job given the health problems he has had most people would not appreciate what he has been through
8134108 purely ifrs international financial reporting standards nonsense and can be safely disregarded as a legitimate inclusion in any proper analysis of the result
8134109 gpgs portfolio has not been immune from the worldwide sharemarket shakeout and to that extent we believe most of those losses will be recovered and more
8134110 the majority of gpgs investments are sound strategic long term holdings where we are confident of intrinsic value regardless of share price fluctuations
8134111 my whole thing is that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so expletive smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what expletive dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
8134112 signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir
8134113 was a promise that all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8134114 all we say to america is be true to what you said on paper
8134115 all of gods children black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics
8134116 part of the the problem now is that these conventions are so heavily covered that the images are more important than the substance
8134117 so i can understand the desire of party leaders to present as harmonious a front as possible
8134118 to create wisdom and compassion in the minds of the oppressor
8134119 sie hatten den falschen namen auf dem dokument eingetragen weshalb ich verlangte da sie den namen korrigierten ehe sie sie mitnahmen ich mahnte sie auch da sie sie innerhalb der genannten zeit zur ckbringen m ten
8134120 sie erkl rte ihnen da es nicht verboten sei an einem ffentlich zug nglichen ort zu fotografieren und da sie keine sperrgebiete oder milit rischen einrichtungen aufgesucht habe sie h tten daher keine legale basis sie festzunehmen
8134121 ich kann nicht sagen ob sie beabsichtigten uns einzusch chtern aber wenn sie so mit einer einflu reichen schriftstellerin umgehen die nichts getan hat als ein paar aufnahmen zu machen kann man sich ausmalen was f r eine art von behandlung gew hnliche leute in tibet tag f r tag erfahren
8134122 esta vez habr una audiencia p blica en la que se debatir n todas estas cuestiones antes del comienzo de las obras a diario los vecinos y comerciantes sufren la falta de lugares para estacionar en belgrano por eso considero necesaria la obra
8134123 si lo producido por los estacionamientos se destinara a la construcci n de nuevas autopistas eso no har a m s que complicar el tr nsito que entra en la ciudad
8134124 en la medida en que stos se actualicen y mejoren sus servicios porque nadie bajar de su auto si los transportes p blicos no ofrecen la comodidad que les brinda el propio veh culo
8134125 creo que es necesaria una pol tica de estacionamiento que d prioridad a los residentes y que haya alternativas en centros de transferencia con el transporte p blico para quienes vienen de afuera
8134126 con excepciones las playas en las centralidades de la ciudad tienen ese riesgo y si no hay una pol tica clara no van a resolver el problema de los residentes es necesaria una alternativa de playas bien articuladas con el tren lo que en ingl s llaman park and ride en la regi n metropolitana
8134127 estamos frente a una medida que parece correcta y necesaria pero al no ser parte de un plan integral puede llegar a no cumplir con el fin buscado se impone seg n mi criterio una pol tica que impulse fuertemente el transporte p blico que ste sea inclusivo y accesible no contaminante y la adopci n de medidas que desalienten el uso del autom vil en reas cr ticas
8134128 algunos antecedentes en el mundo agreg ofrecen incluso que a aquellos que tienen cocheras gratis en las oficinas se les d la opci n de incrementar sus ingresos por el valor mensual de la cochera si no la usan
8134129 si no hay un buen transporte p blico va a ser dif cil que la gente quiera llegar de esa forma hasta el centro por el momento creo que esto s lo va a servir para solucionar la falta de estacionamiento de los vecinos de la zona
8134130 kami memiliki hasil bagus di misano tahun lalu saya yakin mengingat kondisi setelan motor dan ban dalam kondisi baik jadi wajar saja kami memiliki kepercayaan seperti ini
8134131 setelah kegagalan pada balapan sebelumnya kami langsung mengadakan tes untuk memperbaiki kesalahan untuk itu kami percaya bisa meraih hasil maksimal pada balapan di misano nanti
8134132 not because of the candidate but because we want real change in our communities
8134133 you know i was going to go with mitt romney but then i read rick lowrys post on the corner and i decide you know that huckabee sounds pretty good
8134134 oh youre a woman youre going to vote for the woman
8134135 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8134136 life is too short time is too precious and the stakes are too high to dwell on what might have been we have to work together for what still can be
8134137 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8134138 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8134139 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8134140 its encouraging to see the benefit of lower gas prices helping consumers a bit
8134141 george was so full of life and jokes and energy and he never slowed down for a minute he made everyone who came here feel like a friend this was the cheers of delicatessens
8134142 he left after the police arrived but the family would like to thank him for all that he did
8134143 my mom and george had their graduation photo taken together but they went their separate ways but then after 25 years they found one another again
8134144 george worked hard and he knew everyone who came in he was a part of everyones life
8134145 there are three older sisters gail patti and myself they are not here in town but george and i were very close and he will be greatly missed by his sisters and everyone else kids came here for their lollipops we watched them grow up george made it special for everybody
8134146 he worked 12 hours a day six days a week and 95 percent of the recipes were all in his head
8134147 no one else can do it without george there is no more georges were all going to have to learn to cook again
8134148 george was a veteran and were going to fly his flag that day and pull it down at sunset
8134149 a set of policy decisions and a software and services framework that will allow interoperability of various formats and drm schemes that are currently splintering the market
8134150 in other words allowing everyone not just web developers to remix the web so it fits their needs no matter what page they are on or what they are doing
8134151 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand
8134152 for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time ubiquitys interface goal is to enable the user to instruct the browser by typing speaking using language what they want to do
8134153 the elements trying to hinder smooth operation of the new government would be wiped out on their own
8134154 the elements the nepali people overthrew are again issuing challenges to bring down the maoist led government before the first hundred days however they will not succeed
8134155 if attempts are made to oust us from the government we will mobilise the people
8134156 we are not afraid at all as we will prove that we can sustain the government by mobilising the people
8134157 that is why one should not worry about the sustainability of the maoist led government
8134158 developing an uncensorable wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis

8134162 buyers have the upper hand builders responded with price cuts
8134163 its clear it will still take some time to work though the downturn in housing
8134164 once housing prices stabilize that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
8134165 selling voters on the brand is crucial to sealing the deal

8134174 a recent study by the university of pennsylvanias national annenberg election survey which said young viewers of
8134175 viewers of jon stewarts show are more likely to have completed four years of college than people who watch
8134176 pew research center study showing the network has the most balanced audience in cable news 39 percent republicans and 33 percent democrats
8134177 but being out of touch with mainstream america is nothing new to jon as evidenced by the crash and burn ratings of this years oscars telecast
8134178 fairly allowing everyone to watch and being watched near equally among people of both left and right wing political stances
8134179 the most important thing to do regarding the hospital is to properly utilise the existing infrastructure and the services of the doctors
8134180 problems regardind funds is of course there we repeatedly asked the state government to release enough funds for the ailing hospital yet with the mere sanction of funds the problem remained
8134181 many instruments were found non functioning and the authority seemed to have any answer for the same similarly what i felt is that the services of the doctors working there were not being rightly utilised this seemed to be alarming as a huge number of people hailing from the six districts of north bengal region are dependent on nbmch for treatment
8134182 i would take up the issue with the state health minister again and urge him to take serious interest in the functioning of the premier health institution of the region
8134183 it was a premature birth and the babies were underweight
8134184 we used the nrc kit and the blood tested hiv negative
8134185 when there are conflicting results the blood has to be tested thrice more
8134186 we did that as well as test the blood of the parents to see if the infection could have come from them while the parents tested negative the babys blood however was found to be hiv positive
8134187 all over nepal hospitals are conducting blood tests using the nrc approved kit if the kit is faulty it is a serious issue as there could be other erroneous tests
8134188 we run a poor patients fund at the hospital and we agreed to put nepali rs 100 000 there for the boy on purely humanitarian grounds
8134189 we also agreed on the same grounds to provide free treatment for the baby as long as he is with us
8134190 no progress has been achieved to date in securing their formal discharge although many have been released informally
8134191 today they are still in the maoist cantonments and they must be released immediately
8134192 unmin child protection advisers unicef and its partners should have access to these children to make sure that they receive their rights to recovery and reintegration
8134193 the successful april elections signal that the people of nepal are entering a hopeful phase for peace and prosperity
8134194 however the promise of peace has not come to fruition for these children whose lives have been adversely affected by the conflict
8134195 the illegal trade in butterflies or insects is becoming one of the major booming businesses
8134196 its done in a very systematic way and targeting a very different group
8134197 people who are collecting insects come down here illegally they would have photographs they will call up these village children and they would show them photographs and give them a small amount of money like five rupees or 10 rupees if somebody brings back butterflies or insects
8134198 a large part of the eastern himalayas is still unexplored its also very difficult for several of the species to ascertain whether they are endangered or whether they are threatened
8134199 smaller towns and cities in tier ii and iii category shows tremendous growth prospect for the organised retail industry these are the towns where aspirations of the youth are high
8134200 the competition will get hotter in the smaller towns and cities in about five years
8134201 we are possibly the only retailer who has such a large footprint across the country in fact its not just tier ii cities but we have a presence in tier iii and tier iv cities as well
8134202 inflation does have a marginal impact but as value retailers it is at these times that we can get the customer to come to our stores in droves because of the offers we give them
8134203 aadhar provides farmers with solutions to problems regarding their agricultural output which includes what kind of crop can they plant and when along with techno commercial suggestions to help them give a better output we also provide them with insurance products to cover their risk and supermarkets for their daily needs
8134204 not only did we become the preferred destination for shopping for value seeking customers but were also able to attract new customers through food bazaars monthly bachat bazaar savings plan we also took a conscious decision to not increase the cost of our private label brands for the next six months
8134205 the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market
8134206 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8134207 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8134208 everything about this looks like a strong storm that would evacuate platforms
8134209 we think energy prices are absolutely tied to the value of the dollar
8134210 an initial surge up in price but it may affect demand as well
8134211 reed mah marysue have teh secksual inturcourse wit hawt stud or i keel ur family 111 1 one
8134212 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
8134213 the economic patient is starting to show signs of life
8134214 we cannot stress the importance of confidence enough its not the key driver of wealth but is critical for maintaining momentum
8134215 the problem is that our functions directly concern the wildlife species and the forests who cannot speak for themselves and we need to be proactive to save them from dangers like disease poaching or felling but in the absence of conveyance we are not being able to reach out to the most of the forest areas and as obvious this is adversely affecting the wildlife surveillance
8134216 but in the meantime i would like to remind the agitators that any degradation in the darjeeling forests or damages to the wildlife would in turn harm them adversely i urge them to at least relent the forest department from their agitation
8134217 coming of a new media company will only help the media sector and reporters and the readers
8134218 youre going to have an erosion of the tax base we wont be able to sell homes
8134219 it might just mean the end of the hearing examiner system in a way
8134220 if the diminishing asset doctrine is applied in this case then you could presume that the entire 72 000 acres owned by pope resources would also be subject to the diminishing asset doctrine
8134221 made it clear in their declarations that the company has always intended to mine the 182 acres only therefore this application does not apply to the balance of the 72 000 acres hood canal tree farm
8134222 so 72 000 acres of land is safe and not about to be plundered nothing was imperiled
8134223 the economy is not doing that great fuel prices are terrible
8134224 det r s llan man f r en s stor succ
8134225 jetzt ist die zeit gekommen sich als eine partei mit einem ziel zu versammeln
8134226 barack obama ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident sein
8134227 es ist zeit f r uns unser land das wir lieben wieder zur ck zu erobern egal ob ihr f r mich gestimmt habt oder f r barack
8134228 es ist zeit einig zu sein als eine partei mit einem anliegen und als ein team
8134229 eine stolze mutter eine stolze demokratin eine stolze senatorin new yorks eine stolze amerikanerin und eine stolze unterst tzerin von barack obama
8134230 wir sind geeint und wir stehen zusammen und sind entschlossen
8134231 das ist nicht richtig das sind vier weitere jahre die wir uns nicht leisten k nnen
8134232 amerika hat nie angst vor der zukunft gehabt und wir sollten jetzt nicht damit anfangen
8134233 wenn er die antwort ist dann muss die frage ein witz sein
8134234 ich habe eine bessere idee lasst ihnen noch vier weitere monate und w hlt dann barack obama
8134235 sie hatte 50 prozent der demokraten stimmen bekommen und man musste sich schon au erordentlich m hen sie als vizekandidatin zu vermeiden
8134236 i dont think were properly suited to service a community that doesnt speak english
8134237 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8134238 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8134239 lets see how the cda san francisco goes that will tell alot about how the 4th quarter shapes up
8134240 it used to be the first question was how long has it been on the market
8134241 recently there hasnt been as much of an urgency for buyers to do something
8134242 a lot of people are saying we want to wait until winter when we can get the best deal
8134243 were seeing a lot of people that bought within the last two years when money was cheap so to break even theyre maintaining a high listing price its only worth what im going to pay for it
8134244 if a house had already been reduced several times my thought before i would walk in was can i get the house for less than its listed right now
8134245 you see far more price reductions than you ever saw before
8134246 every individual seller has to make the decision how long do i want to have my home on the market
8134247 one of them friends asked me if i would mind not going out with them to a restaurant one evening as they find the whole paparazzi thing alarming
8134248 he benji actually helped me write some of the songs for my new album and for the bff show hes a really amazing talent songwriter and singer
8134249 i dont want to say its harsh but it was a bit of a surprise
8134250 people are cracking down ninety nine percent of the players ive talked to support it a couple of players may take issue with it but its not a big deal
8134251 i believe its good for the tour and it applies to everyone not just the koreans there are only a few cases where players are unable to do their professional duties within a few months those people will have no problems with the proper resources and tools all players on tour have the ability to excel at english
8134252 we started zeroing in on players being successful not just on the course but in the broader sports entertainment marketplace
8134253 to do that they have to communicate effectively this is an important thing for the players and for the lpga tour to succeed its important for the future
8134254 it is fair to say we have hit rock bottom at the moment
8134255 but i feel duty bound to carry on for the people of rugby
8134256 however we need to re assess the situation if the people really want us to carry on fighting against rugby cement we will have to look at some sort of fundraising as i have already spent at least 70 000 already on the cases
8134257 i had to put down 25 000 for a deposit to get the case to the house of lords and i dont know if i will get it back and i face paying all the costs of the environment agency because the decision went against us
8134258 el cuarto lugar de juan ren serrano es buen simo quiz s m s de lo que nos podamos imaginar aunque a veces cuando no se llega a las medallas autom ticamente sientes como que un cuarto lugar del mundo no es importante
8134259 m xico no tiene desarrollado el tiro con arco simplemente naci en la olimpiada nacional y ha ido poco a poco es por eso que un cuarto lugar es muy importante
8134260 es un buen lugar para la edad que tiene y cumpli para ser sus primeros juegos ol mpicos
8134261 los dos tienen un gran futuro pero a marlene la vimos en el tercer lugar despu s de la prueba de tiro y nos damos cuenta de que tiene un gran talento
8134262 ambas no tuvieron competencias muy buenas pero por lo menos fabiola corona fue la primera mujer mexicana que compite en el triatl n en juegos ol mpicos
8134263 hay que recordar que gaby medina ha roto las marcas que ten a ana guevara a su edad incluso haber calificado a la semifinal de los 400 metros es un gran logro para ella
8134264 creo que laura pudo haber hecho un poco m s pero el resultado no es malo
8134265 hay que tomar en cuenta que ahora fueron nueve jaliscienses en deportes que no son de conjunto lo cual es un gran n mero
8134266 lo primero es tener gente que vaya despu s que empiecen a destacar y despu s vendr n las medallas as que hay que tener paciencia y vendr n los resultados
8134267 necesitamos ayudarles aqu en jalisco y a nivel nacional porque si no hay un proyecto bueno en las federaciones y en la conade por m s esfuerzo que hagamos nosotros no va a pasar nada
8134268 si estamos hablando de que el deporte nacional va a hacer su parte y va a cambiar a romper los paradigmas a tener nuevas reglas a traer entrenadores s tenemos materia prima en jalisco y en m xico para tener buenos resultados mejores de los que hemos tenido antes tampoco vamos a cambiar de la noche a la ma ana
8134269 la actuaci n de los deportistas jaliscienses estuvo dentro de las fortalezas que tenemos aunque nos hubiera encantado que llegara una medalla
8134270 ive been watching a lot of tape on oregon state
8134271 weve been focusing on this one game for a while because its the first one i feel like ive prepared myself pretty well
8134272 coach jim harbaugh thats one of his lines look on the film from last year and theres a guy whos not recognizable
8134273 consistency is a little overrated unless you are talking about consistently good
8134274 thats the consistency that you strive for what our offense needs to do is move the ball and score points and ultimately the quarterback is judged by how the team does
8134275 weve come a long way weve got young guys coming in and playing at high level
8134276 one win one win in the win column thats the only thing im counting
8134277 we know at times the bar cars can be very crowded if we eliminate them we can allow people to get through to less crowded cars more easily some people avoid going into the bar car
8134278 i come to the bar car so i can be loud obnoxious and have a good time at the end of the workday
8134279 these people just want to be around people who are lively and not reliving the workday or dreading going home or whatever it is
8134280 some people go to happy hour we go to the bar car
8134281 were like family if somebody is gone for awhile you worry about them we have each others phone numbers
8134282 ab 2009 ist sogar ein arbeitslosenbeitrag von 2 5 m glich
8134283 this is a good first half performance demonstrating our competitiveness against a background of weaker economies and increased input costs
8134284 we have maintained the momentum of our topline growth and again ensured that the heineken brand outperforms the market and increases its share of the international premium segment
8134285 through continued delivery of our fit2fight targets rigorous cost management is now an established part of our operational approach
8134286 the integration of the scottish amp newcastle businesses into heineken is proceeding swiftly
8134287 in the second half we will continue to drive and benefit from premiumisation cost reduction and our stronger more competitive global position

8134431 god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwells not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing seeing he gives to all life and breath and all things
8134432 and god said let there be light and there was light

8134435 judaism had existed and flourished since the days of abraham who is the father of judaism approximately 2 000 years later the man named jesus came upon the scene teaching the jewish people that judaism had been perverted he then proceeded to reinstate the vital meanings of original judaism which became known as christianity within a few decades of his crucifixion the jewish leaders of jesus time were in danger of losing their jobs as priests if the truth was revealed about their double dealing methods of providing justice much like what is going on in the worlds justice system today justice was being perverted by the payment of monies bribes amp corruption and judaism was no longer the vanguard of justice being dealt out equally toward all men jew and gentile alike money bought favors and blinded the eyes of justice when jesus began revealing the truth about the perversions in judaism the jewish people like americans already knew it in their hearts

8134502 i have lied and stolen from friends and family to do whatever i could by any means to find my daughter i avoided calling the police or even notifying my family out of fear i have been and still am afraid of what has or may happen to caylee

8134505 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8134506 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8134507 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8134508 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8134509 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8134510 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them
8134511 must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8134512 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
8134513 we did every possible tv show we did it all there were ups and downs like in everything but ralph was my friend and a great singer and i have the greatest admiration for him
8134514 ralph was very humorous he was a very funny cat actually
8134515 there was a lot of humor in sandler amp young i mostly played the straight man and he played a bit of a buffoon type and me being european was supposed to be the more suave of the pair and ralph was more the typical brash american
8134516 was considered more a bass baritone where im more a baritone cantabile
8134517 thats why i mostly harmonized with him which created that sandler amp young sound
8134518 it was just a close harmonic effect by the two baritone voices which was unique you cant predict something like that when two voices click like that its unusual and its rare
8134519 a whos who of show business saw us including ed sullivan we were on the ed sullivan show and the rest is history
8134520 we are working with fema to get to the bottom of it

8134532 the media would love to see a roll call vote but from an image standpoint that obviously would not be in the best interest of the democratic party
8134533 theres definitely more excitement at this convention than any one ive been to
8134534 people talk about the american dream but this party is living it right now nominating barack obama for president speaks volumes
8134535 a major political party is about to practice what it preaches it sends a wave of excitement not only through the convention but across the nation and i understand the world as well

8134545 the dga was so kind in inviting over the whole delegation
8134546 seeing sen ted kennedy give his speech given his health conditions was outstanding
8134547 given the narrowing of the gap in the polls its going to be a dogfight
8134548 i believe he needs to make some strategic and well placed visits to the state
8134549 this is a day of celebration as we turn the governance in a number of areas back to the board

8134552 wes confirmed with the driver that the tanker was empty
8134553 wes told the driver he had to get out of the truck due to the fire but the driver told wes he could not feel his legs and could not move
8134554 wes grabbed the driver and dragged him from the truck to the ground
8134555 wes had used all of his fire extinguisher when two more truck drivers stopped and helped him pull the driver to the roadway safely away from the fire
8134556 i got a call from his wife saying that he had passed away
8134557 and i really thought he was going to be okay i spent two hours with him and i just didnt think hed pass away
8134558 he spoke to his manager about it and then his manager passed the information along and we thought this was just a great thing that he did
8134559 when you think of a hero you never think of it in reference to yourself
8134560 but people like wes show through their actions what courage is all about
8134561 i think its great and i appreciate it but i didnt really expect anything
8134562 you know what youre going to do you dont think
8134563 its the kind of thing you think about every time you go by that spot

8134565 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8134566 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game

8134579 the marks on the ground tell us that the plane hit the ground tail first and as a result the tail cone the end part of the plane broke off
8134580 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
8134581 and i said to myself something is going on here
8134582 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling
8134583 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
8134584 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
8134585 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
8134586 letter lots of us want to love and respect china but right now china isnt helping
8134587 first in my personal relationships with mainlanders people are often so hyper sensitive about how foreigners see china that we cant actually have
8134588 westerners can easily and naturally make this ruler people distinction
8134589 the methods and actions that chinas rulers use to create and protect their glorious national
8134590 western media doesnt understand china and makes negative reports thats why westerners dont like china
8134591 you sound a bit like someone who knew next to nothing about china before you came here romantic notions about pretty girls buddhist temples good food and chinese characters but not a clue about what life in the peoples republic is really like
8134592 cctv could put a negative segment on the us about the heathcare situation guantanamo iraq housing situation bankrupt americans etc im sure that within a year many chinese would have a negative opinion about the usa however china does not tend to cover that or put a negative light on those issues
8134593 foreigners are perhaps not aware that such conversations are common
8134594 it would be too easy to for example to read a bunch of fenqing online and then project that onto my friends and acquaintances here
8134595 what makes humans human how can we make them more so
8134596 wow you have so much dirty laundry youre a horrible person
8134597 your article is totally marred by the political correctness running throughout out
8134598 some of the political fallout from the games has not been so positive last week police sentenced several members of the group students for a free tibet and citizen journalists recording their protests to 10 days of administrative detention the group said that on sunday during the closing ceremony china deported those detained but some observers point out that from a chinese perspective the olympics are not a time for openness they are a time to show social order and unity a time when you tidy up your house before the guests arrive or at least hide the dirty laundry
8134599 for the most part i believe in the modern era that the fear of china comes from communism the fear that america and most of the western developed nations feel about it thus the vietnam war for fear of communism being spread out into the world it was america that had spread the propaganda that communism is out to get the free world
8134600 why does this blog focus on the opinions of the west so much what about opinions in the rest of the world
8134601 people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost
8134602 a society is judged by the way they treat their animals
8134603 i can clearly see we have some people with math degrees on here 100 00 divided by 1 000 is 100 100 per dog that isnt gonna touch the cost of rescuing these puppies by the time you add up the cost to transport feed bath have a vet check each dog and the cost while the dog is waiting to be adopted 100 00 isnt near enough
8134604 dogs have always been cherished members of our family and it is outrageous to me to think that they would be used in barbaric bloody contests for the purpose of greed and a sick sense of entertainment
8134605 the humane society of the united states has shown its commitment and success with this issue and we are proud to provide this grant so that more animals do not have to become the victims of animal fighting
8134606 we are enormously grateful for the generosity of the ware foundation and we will honor it by working every day to put an end to this most horrendous and inexcusable form of animal cruelty
8134607 the iranian threat is the greatest threat to the world today

8134616 we recovered all of the stolen property from the aug 14 burglary one firearm and were still working on the property from the other burglaries
8134617 we separated the three occupants to ask questions and all three related different stories
8134618 we found a loaded shotgun a loaded 22 and a loaded 380 pistol believed to have been taken from one of the suspects parents home without permission
8134619 while searching the vehicle we also found a small drawer containing jewelry with an estimated value of 200 to 300 and a checkbook bearing the name of a chattahoochee hill country resident
8134620 a second did the same thing and admitted that they had done all four of the recent burglaries
8134621 we were also able to recover some of the property from the other burglaries
8134622 la entidad demandada esto es la naci n el ministerio de defensa y la polic a incurri en fallas del servicio por no prever el ataque y por fallas en la respuesta armado de guerrilla a los agentes que se hallaban en el comando de la polic a antinarc ticos ubicado en el zona comercial del municipio de miraflores

8134650 this is in keeping with the humanitarianism which to avoid hurting one individual lets a hundred others perish the demand that defective people be prevented from propagating equally defective offspring is a demand of the clearest reason and if systematically executed represents the most humane act of mankind
8134651 we prefer the policy of immediate sterilizarion of making sure that parenthood is absolutely prohibed to the feeble minded
8134652 the danger to the community of the unsegregated feeble minded woman is more evident most dangerous are the middle and high grades living at large who despite the fact that their defect is not easily recognizable should nevertheless be prevented from procreation in my view we should act without delay
8134653 i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question
8134654 we also recognize the importance of good medical care for women that were also recognizing the importance of age appropriate education to reduce risks i do believe that contraception has to be part of that education process
8134655 i think that most americans recognize that this is a profoundly difficult issue partial birth abortion for the women and families who make these decisions they dont make them casually and i trust women to make these decisions in conjunction with their doctors and their families and their clergy and i think thats where most americans are
8134656 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
8134657 as an ardent practicing catholic uh this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and uh senator uh im senator uh st augustin sic said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child uh eh er first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester the the theres very clear distinctions
8134658 and this is like 50 years or something like that so again over the history uh of the church this is an issue of uh controversy
8134659 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state
8134660 true i was born guilty a sinner even as my mother conceived me
8134661 before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you came to birth i consecrated you
8134662 when he issued the decrees for jacob and instituted a law in israel he gave our ancestors strict orders to teach it to their children the next generation was to learn it the children still to be born
8134663 human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of god and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the creator who is its sole end god alone is the lord of life from its beginning until its end no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being
8134664 many say that such a system could never happen here

8134800 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations

8134813 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
8134814 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
8134815 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
8134816 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8134817 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads

8134892 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8134893 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8134894 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8134901 and i think its going to be whichever team comes out ready to play could win on that night so weve talked a lot about the pressure and just being prepared to play every night
8134902 our expectations are high our expectations are the same that theyve always been in the past we want to win so what were doing is trying to put ourselves in a position to do that

8134916 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8134917 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8134918 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8134919 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8134920 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8134921 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising

8134967 it would be a big win if we could do it but all we can guarantee is that well go out and give it everything not just count down the minutes in the game until the end of the season but just go out and enjoy the challenge of playing against a great side worsfold said
8134968 this week well go out to compete and play at our best and the expectation is probably not that were a great chance to win but anything can happen
8134969 you go out to get your match ups as good as you can get them give players great opportunities and you expect them to do their best
8134970 the hardest day they are ever going to have in their life but worsfold said his team was ready for the challenge
8134971 we are going to lap that up thats one thing for sure worsfold said
8134972 its a great learning environment for a lot of our players it will be a great learning environment for me

8134975 real commitment for the dnc and the various candidates to take a real commitment to the latino vote
8134976 we hispanics are severely underrepresented in terms of voter registration s and the numbers have been going down steadily since 1968

8134978 when he leaves office he is going to leave us with something we have had corrupt governors before but at least this one is leaving us with something he did a lot for illinois children
8134979 i do think people want to have an idea of whos going to be their next leader especially with the mess thats going on in springfield
8134980 i will say this i do believe gov blagojevich if he runs again is going to have a primary opponent or two or 10
8134981 this is something im going to think about and when i make a decision you will know about it
8134982 i think he has done a very good job even though he has not gotten a lot of credit for it

8134984 tom designed the course we just helped out with a couple of the specialty kinds of things like hanging the cables and things like that
8134985 the idea is to get the group up and over the top by working together
8134986 scout groups church groups maybe well be able to take the chicago bandits through it

8134997 only on gilligans island tv land listen to me youre just guessing
8134998 obviously they are what if they need to carry these things farther still what if theyre just resting what if they are trained to do this when they need to rest drop their packages find a hole rest then grab their stuff and carry on
8134999 so are you suggesting we flush them out cause there is no way im going to crawl back there they can get out later on their own

8135078 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8135079 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8135080 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8135081 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry
8135082 i want to be dominant master discipline oral and spanking i want you to let me take control
8135083 maybe i shouldnt be going to school i should do what you do
8135084 a fun vacation crossing great waters is coming to you soon
8135085 as i have to cross the great lakes to get to the cottage i figured it was preety apt
8135086 in terms of raw power dynamics progressives are not particularly relevant
8135087 i know they would do the right thing for our children and make it safe and secure for them
8135088 theres been no concerns about safety if anything its more safe my concerns have been alleviated school is more than a building its the heart and soul of the teachers and faculty
8135089 the final cosmetic repairs are not completed in the building
8135090 we are still waiting to get those done it will be done in the summer
8135091 our engineering and architectural firm has designed the permanent fix for that area
8135092 they dont see it they dont know it they are here to learn
8135093 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8135094 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8135095 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8135096 george bush has put the middle class in a hole and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8135097 if there was an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold they want another four year term to continue to alienate our allies spend our childrens inheritance and hollow out our economy
8135098 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8135099 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8135100 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8135101 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8135102 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
8135103 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8135104 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8135105 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8135106 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8135107 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8135108 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8135109 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
8135110 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
8135111 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8135112 if theres some hard feelings let it show a little bit
8135113 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
8135114 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent

8135124 in africa and south america the cattle were shifted slightly to a more north eastern south western direction
8135125 but it is known that the earths magnetic field is much weaker there
8135126 i would have to actually challenge that statement if i may
8135127 by tearing up his check for obama he basically wrote one to mccain
8135128 i openly no flamingly endorse obama whether he says hes for gay marriage or not i know under obama it will only be a matter of time until the country sees the legalization of gay marriage
8135129 for our gay lesbian bisxexual transgender rights to continue to grow and not further diminish then we need to stand behind obama good luck with your life mr colichman i hope you get to sleep well at night after mccain becomes elected shame on you
8135130 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
8135131 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
8135132 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
8135133 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
8135134 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
8135135 when the brains survival mode kicks in and gives the body a wake up call
8135136 the world was never meant for one as beautiful as you
8135137 my view is we need to come together as a party
8135138 i admire hillary clinton greatly but i think it would be divisive to have a vote on the floor we need to have a unanimous vote
8135139 we just want a roll call like youre supposed to have
8135140 i came out here by god to vote for her and im going to do it
8135141 she is our captain we dont want to see her disrespected
8135142 i think the votes should be cast and counted the way they have been historically
8135143 but i dont think every delegate needs to stand and say something i want a good convention
8135144 ive seen the petition but im not going to focus on that
8135145 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the u s dollar
8135146 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
8135147 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8135148 and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8135149 the shifting faith vote what it means for the election
8135150 the push for the democratic party is to have a new position on abortion
8135151 when you look at catholics and evangelicals you see that they agree with 80 percent of what mr obama says but theres this stumbling block with abortion
8135152 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
8135153 assuming that the guilty partys identity and responsibility have been fully determined the traditional teaching of the church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor if however nonlethal means are sufficient to defend and protect peoples safety from the aggressor authority will limit itself to such means as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the human person today in fact as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has for effectively preventing crime by rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm without definitely taking away from him the possibility of redeeming himself the cases in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity are very rare if not practically nonexistent
8135154 i think this archbishop is anti catholic and is trying to drive catholics out of politics

8135161 the most logical and critical action to address the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs is to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
8135162 although ocean acidification is affecting the health of our oceans the same thing increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is going to in fact be affecting terrestrial environments also

8135168 in 148 days george bush no longer will be president
8135169 in the north and northwest suburbs there are new people there are young people living out there the 60s and 70s are over those people who voted solidly republican have moved away or just simply are gone
8135170 they think all they have to say is im not a republican im for change
8135171 it worked two years ago but people are really taking a serious look at the candidates they want more than just the sound bite they want people who have experience and they want people who will make the right changes in policy
8135172 he didnt get anything done in the first hour because his office was jam packed with people
8135173 he surprised us he just came in one person cried
8135174 the existing library is a fine building but its outdated its too small
8135175 its time we improve on what we have going to a library you probably can save a lot of money borrowing books movies magazines
8135176 we have roads that people cant drive down without chattering their teeth twenty five million dollars is a lot of money its going to limit what we can do
8135177 todays vote represents a turning point it changes the policy for how the commission governs this agency
8135178 my colleagues and i are confident that the changes weve instituted will not only prevent future situations such as those highlighted in the performance audit report but will make the port a stronger more agile organization as we continue our mission of bringing jobs and economic growth to king county
8135179 resolution 3605 is a major reform milestone for the port a key step in our ongoing work to improve commission oversight of the port
8135180 this commission is continually looking for ways to make the port more efficient and transparent and the new delegation resolution provides a strong tool for us in our continuing efforts to make the port a more effective public agency
8135181 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8135182 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8135183 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
8135184 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
8135185 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8135186 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8135187 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
8135188 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
8135189 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
8135190 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
8135191 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8135192 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
8135193 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
8135194 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
8135195 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
8135196 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
8135197 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8135198 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8135199 to us scenic is natural terrain not an altered terrain its a natural view of a forest open hillside creek sweeping view of the ocean not a building for industrial use
8135200 in essence there would be two different categories of wineries
8135201 it is a beautiful location we wanted to capture the scenic quality of the natural terrain
8135202 its not very scenic for la honda weve been looking at gaping holes in the ridge for five years

8135210 barack obama got a special deal from a convicted felon
8135211 i think it was a strange thing for barack obama to seize upon
8135212 if homes is going to be the topic of discussion that barack obama is going to end up on the short end of that one

8135226 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8135227 im very excited and very happy it came out like this
8135228 for a little while everyone was worried he might get away with this
8135229 do you expect someone on the church choir to be friends with this guy beltran we didnt pick our witnesses the defendant did you may not like zuno but he came in here and told you what he saw
8135230 its totally false and im sure it will all come out that way
8135231 its a shame that we have a system in which someone can make these kinds of claims without any proof

8135241 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8135242 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8135243 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8135244 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8135245 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8135246 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8135247 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8135248 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8135249 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8135250 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8135251 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8135252 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8135253 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8135254 we rely on the expertise of the buying staff to determine the hot new items for each category and what the trends are for the upcoming seasons
8135255 more than 100 buyers attend markets and product shows year round to ensure they are in tune with the trends of their category
8135256 we want to continue to enhance our human resources capacity and what better way to do that than to take some lessons learned from another top notch operation
8135257 because the air force contact center at afpc is able to provide quality multi tiered support to so many people we definitely wanted to get a hands on look on how they do things
8135258 i was especially impressed with their use of technology in their personnel processes ms
8135259 from the contact center to the records management area all of us now have quite a few takeaways we can apply to our organization
8135260 i think the excitement is in the air i know our players are excited i think the biggest challenge we have right now is keeping their emotions in check i felt that we had a real good spring we made some changes offensively and moved some people around on the defense so everyone is excited to see where we are and how we are going to do this year
8135261 we are anxious for the temple game we know that this is a good football team and not the same team we played last year they only traveled a couple of seniors last year so there are a lot of returning starters and lettermen they are a very talented football team so its going to be a great challenge and should be a real good contest for west point
8135262 offensively i am excited it will be interesting to see where we are we havent been able to do anything but run this offense against our defense i think that quarterback carson williams has done a great job learning all of the aspects of the new offense i am very proud of our coaching staff for all that they have done and learned i think the most important thing is their ability to teach and i think that they have done a great job with this group of kids carson will be our starting quarterback we have made some changes on the offensive line just by position and well have a couple of different running backs in there so were excited to see it work
8135263 i think well have as much speed as weve had at the linebacker position im excited to see our defensive line we feel that we have good depth in the defensive line and they are moving around very well its going to be a big matchup with temple ive heard that they are going to play some young offensive linemen but even those guys are big men they probably average around 6 5 and 300 pounds so its going to be a big challenge for our defensive line but they will be ready for it
8135264 the question mark and what will be a big challenge for us this week is our defensive backfield they know were young and dont have a lot of experience i know that those guys will come up and hit you our safeties will play the run and the pass and our corners are going to have to grow up and grow up in a hurry
8135265 i havent made a lot of decisions on special teams yet when we practice i want to see who is going to be the most accurate extra point and field goal kicker who can kick it the farthest and who has the hang time so that will probably be a game time decision just about every week
8135266 i think well continue to progress as we go through the season by no stretch of the imagination have we perfected anything this will be something that well tweak twist and turn as the game goes on and the season goes on from week to week well make changes
8135267 well probably continue to make changes there are some that do certain things better than others and you always want to play to the players strength so if we need something else we can always make a change that includes the quarterback position and offensive line im not afraid to make those changes and our goal is to win football games well challenge them every week as to who wants to be the starter thats just the way that it is going to be
8135268 we havent seen their offense either so i dont really know in the first game you dont get to watch film youre basing everything off of last year they know that we are an option based run football team and what our formations are but they havent seen any film on it we havent seen any film on what they are doing are they going to line up and run the same offense they ran last year i doubt it we have to prepare for a lot of different things but that is no different from anybody else around the country preparing for their first game
8135269 i just wanted some bigger guys in there and i thought he lemming was doing a really good job the goal was to get the best five offensive linemen on the field i didnt care where i had to move them around or who i had to play where we know who the best five are and we just wanted to get them out there together
8135270 heres what i ask all of the players to do do the very best that you can if they go out there and they play the best that they can play then im good with that and well continue to get better are they going to get beat yes when you are a defensive back you are going to get beat and you have to have a short memory they work very hard and they are going to go out and play to the very best of their ability and that is all you can ask
8135271 from a defensive standpoint they have a lot of talent they have guys that can fly around they have good size and quickness on the defensive line ive read that they have moved some of their linebackers around and the linebackers that we faced and where they were will be a little different they were playing hard last year and playing better so you can only assume that they are a much better football team
8135272 offensively i think their quarterback adam dimichele was one of the top three quarterbacks we faced last year and we faced some good quarterbacks i felt that when he was in the pocket we did okay but when he gets out of the pocket he is very accurate scrambling he has some young receivers that have a lot of speed that can get open so i think that they are going to be much better they had a lot of yards against us last year so it is going to be a big challenge i think that is how you have to look at it how they are going to be better they are another year older and they were pretty darn good last year
8135273 the players love that kind of field with the rubber down there its a good look and i like the logos from an aesthetics standpoint its a great looking field and i know the kids like to play on it
8135274 i would play the first thing in the morning if i had the option because of my last 16 years in the nfl i liked getting up getting the pregame meal going to the stadium and playing to me sitting around a hotel all day wears on my nerves i know our kids dont mind playing in the evening because it allows them a little more sleep sleep is a big thing to them coming in rested up is probably a positive i think our kids like playing in the evening ive never really asked them so i dont know if it really matters but personally i prefer to play at noon
8135275 its looking pretty good we have been working very hard since camp and things are starting to come together im very excited its a new experience for me with the fullbacks role in this offense we havent played any games yet so i dont know what it feels like but well see on friday night
8135276 i hope to bring my own style and do my own thing its a tremendous honor i like that i have the respect of my teammates to elect me captain i want to be able to serve my teammates and do a great job
8135277 offensively i think we have to come off the ball very hard if the offensive line comes hard and the fullback hits hard everything will be in sync
8135278 for us on defense its coming off the ball hard and getting a lot of pressure on the quarterback we cant think we have to react and play like were having fun and make plays
8135279 its harder to prepare in the sense that you have to learn more styles of offense and more sets but its still football they still have to give the ball to someone and that person has to try and run down the field and were going to try and stop them
8135280 were excited were tired of hitting our heads against the wall tired of hitting the same people and tired of playing against our offense now its time to go out and show what we can do
8135281 it gives you confidence but you cant rest on what happened in the past you can always strive to do better even if we lost by 40 points we would still be the same confident group we have been jelling as a unit since spring ball and were excited to get on the field
8135282 we all know the different tasks and techniques and what we need to do we need to communicate with each other and make the necessary calls and adjustments to effectively play together as a unit were doing a couple of things differently this year weve made some changes that have enabled us to get more playmakers on the field
8135283 were going to be physical and were going to be focused we have to read out keys and do what we need to do to stop teams as best as we can
8135284 it definitely means a lot because its been a long time coming we have had good guys around and a great squad its easy leading these guys
8135285 its the first game of the season and defenses always come out with something different i think well be pretty well prepared we just have to be heads up and ready to go these guys are ready a lot of them have been here before we have to go out stay motivated and stay focused and i think well be all right
8135286 were really excited to get out and play its my senior year and i am hoping to get the ball in my hands do some blocking and run some routes and do whatever i can to help this team win i cant even explain how excited everyone is weve been hitting each other for a long time it will be nice to play against an opponent in michie stadium
8135287 we need to play our game we need to listen to the coaches and listen to offensive coordinator coach tim walsh if we play hard and execute our assignments everything else will fall into place
8135288 predicting it is fine for the sake of kicks but its not a scientifically valid approach
8135289 you have to assume that everything that has happened in the past will continue in the future
8135290 typically when you get someone that big they cant start
8135291 i was here last night and my clothes didnt dry so i am back to dry them
8135292 the dryer starts by itself it started by itself last night it is warm this morning i know it will start by itself again this morning i am waiting for bob the owner to get here so i can tell him my clothes didnt dry last night
8135293 i deserve to live and the powers that be like me more of the time than not

8135307 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8135308 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8135309 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8135310 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8135311 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8135312 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8135313 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans

8135322 we are so excited about the opening of our st charles center just before labor day and wanted to celebrate it by doing something weve never done before entering our donors in a raffle to win a vespa scooter wii system or ipod
8135323 the experience was overwhelmingly positive i hope to have the opportunity to attend a future nij conference
8135324 i was shy quiet and not comfortable speaking in front of groups
8135325 the skills i learned in toastmasters helped me not only prepare my presentation for the nij conference but also deliver well timed humor to keep the audience engaged
8135326 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8135327 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8135328 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8135329 president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8135330 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8135331 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8135332 it is looking like he will be coming back as a regular employee with the same status as he had before
8135333 part of curtis responsibility is to get that evidence to defend himself especially when it isnt being provided by others
8135334 it should show our city that our union isnt going to back off and cower when the city is clearly doing something wrong

8135338 church members their businesses and schools are subject to exactly the same regulations laws and scrutiny by government agencies tribunals and courts as other australian individuals businesses and schools
8135339 i heard this really loud noise and all of a sudden there was a boom and a big explosion
8135340 you could see big black smoke and flames were coming out
8135341 you could see bits of plane flying off and flames shooting up
8135342 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham
8135343 as we understand it and were waiting for final confirmation of this two light planes possibly landing or taking off from moorabbin have clipped wings
8135344 one of those planes landed successfully and the other has crash landed into a houses garden area and as we understand it it was the pilot of the crashed plane that has been killed
8135345 there is a school right on the corner if it had come down another few hundred yards it would have been in the school
8135346 on a hot night youll be sitting in your tv room and you can hardly hear the tv they come down so low
8135347 it was nerve racking ive thought about it often what would happen if one of those planes came down its so densely populated and if youre driving down centre dandenong road they would almost touch your car during landing
8135348 i always thought somethings going to happen one day and ive lived to see it
8135349 because they are both training aircraft and both are operated by the royal victoria aero club you would assume they were both on training exercises
8135350 moorabbin airport holds a certificate from us and we audit them but we dont look at the geographic location of the airport thats a planning issue for the government
8135351 most of the big training airports in australia are in pretty similar suburban locations so its not as if moorabbin is robinson crusoe in this situation it used to be way out in the bush and the city has grown up around it

8135360 i have spent every day since monday june 9 2008 looking for my daughter
8135361 i have lied and stolen from friends and family to do whatever i could by any means to find my daughter i avoided calling the police or even notifying my family out of fear i have been and still am afraid of what has or may happen to caylee
8135362 maybe his wife left him and this is all he has to remember her by

8135365 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech
8135366 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8135367 my friend you just took the bait hook line amp sinker

8135369 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
8135370 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
8135371 tj ayers still makes anti american speeches to various marxist groups such as the sds
8135372 bob bauer makes another credible argument that mr simmons might violate an aggregate federal contribution limit if it can be proven that the money was solicited to run these ads
8135373 dems we need to take this right to the networks this ad is airing on and the advertisers who run ads on those networks next time you see the ad make a list of the other companies running ads in the same commercial break and call their customer service departments demanding that they pull their advertising from the offending network this kind of attack is disgusting and cheapens our political discourse
8135374 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old

8135383 this expansion isnt something we just dreamed up in the last six months
8135384 we offered a proposal for traffic calming and child safety to which the developer has agreed
8135385 this would mean people turning off eola onto the new sheffer connection would come into old eola with a sign that says do not enter
8135386 but it still keeps open the ability for traffic in the local area to get around the neighborhood without blocking them off entirely
8135387 i think this is a good compromise and it tackles a lot of concern that were brought up along the way most of us have kids and or are married and know we must sometimes pick our battles
8135388 i think we have picked the right battle and it is now time to compromise
8135389 this is a document that saves country club village isolates eola and uses sheffer as your own personal cut through for anything westbound
8135390 we were not considered this is not what we wanted

8135409 we are seeing more and more families with more needs

8135416 cuando la vida nos depara un gran desaf o grandes esperanzas de charles dickens
8135417 its a step in a positive direction people are looking forward to the improvements
8135418 the overlook will be a very good asset for the riverfront project
8135419 we have to remind ourselves we are cheerleaders for barack obama
8135420 i know there is issues in springfield cook county chicago washington d c united nations those issues will be decided after this convention lets keep everything out of this convention
8135421 too many of our blue collar americans too many of our union members they like this guy mccain they like him
8135422 this race is too close we should be so far out ahead we should be able to take a breath but im telling you we cant even breathe it is so close
8135423 i think the speaker spots are filling up which is great
8135424 they had lunch together last week and he still stops by here every now and then i am still trying to wrap my head around things
8135425 i would never had suspected a thing in a million years theyre just your average run of the mill family
8135426 things have now evolved to the point where linux subsystems are set up so that you can use a removable device in the same way you use them in windows
8135427 even though linux has reached well beyond its school project roots linux users tend to be soapbox dwelling fanatics who are quick to spout off about why you should be choosing linux over windows
8135428 10 sets of rambling disjointed thoughts full of fallacies and assumptions on both sides
8135429 the event must have worked last year because we are back this year
8135430 its going to be great we have a nice mix of veterans like corey partridge and young guys like ray hutson who can all catch balls
8135431 the fact that we have so many talented receivers is a big advantage for our team we can substitute receivers every four or five plays even as often as every two or three plays depending on the routes we run
8135432 we are a family it is important for us older receivers take the younger receivers under our wing
8135433 not one young receiver has done so much as a minute late to a meeting that is a testament to our older guys its good that none of the guys see this as just a competition but as a group of teammates working to make each other better
8135434 tyrone has looked really good through camp he may be our fastest receiver
8135435 hopefully he can really stretch the field for us and open it up for guys like a t turner in the middle
8135436 i found out at the start of camp that coach wanted to try me out at receiver
8135437 i am excited to help the team any way i can
8135438 a t is an asset wherever he is on the field
8135439 when we found out he was going to be a receiver this year we welcomed the addition with open arms
8135440 we had a better team than that obviously we didnt play well
8135441 were going to have a young team this year we lost jace walker
8135442 jace was very talented and played very well for us last season
8135443 matt and john amongst others are going to have to step up
8135444 its a big hole to fill but i dont expect it should be a problem with the guys that played well this summer
8135445 we lost four guys that we were pretty important to our team thats going to be pretty tough to overcome
8135446 but we got two incoming freshmen and hopefully they can come in and contribute right away and were thinking they will
8135447 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8135448 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8135449 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8135450 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8135451 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8135452 i felt a pop and a pain id never felt before
8135453 the trainers told me i had to show them i could put weight on it and so i put weight on it and collapsed i had to go to the hospital and everything else from there
8135454 any time you lose a top tackler its going to be tough on you as a unit and as a team
8135455 but you hope to mold the people around you the younger guys for when someone gets hurt they can step up and fill that role although thats big shoes to fill you hope you have somebody that can do as well as john did at that point in time last year
8135456 well if the percentage was higher not long ago things must be getting better
8135457 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please take care of me
8135458 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8135459 she made it very clear to her delegates and im one of hers how critical it is to get behind barack obama
8135460 for the short term theyre going to feel even worse
8135461 theyre going to say this is the speech she shouldve given on thursday accepting the nomination but ultimately theyll get behind barack obama
8135462 there will still be a small percentage of people who wont let it go but most democrats want to win and keep our eyes on the prize
8135463 something we should be pushing every time somebody says it next week
8135464 concerned about whether shed be holding back at all but it was clear from the beginning that she was fully in support of barack obama
8135465 she got the message across that her supporters need to come and get behind barack obama
8135466 i think she sincerely means it i hope people dont keep looking for cracks
8135467 she reached out for all of the different segments she even appealed to the african american community that she had problems with in the primaries
8135468 she did her homework she touched on something dear to african americans
8135469 those who were pissed off by clintons loss might never come around but those who were hurt i think itll heal their pain
8135470 i understand their pain being a black man ive felt it numerous times
8135471 the markets are not impressive at the current levels as it is trading in lower volumes for the nifty 4380 is a good resistance levels on the downside it has support at 4250 levels the banking sector will be the first one to show positive movement on rally
8135472 oil markets are keeping a nervous eye on hurricane gustav with forecasts showing it may move into the gulf of mexico
8135473 as well diplomatic tensions involving russia have intensified following russias decision to recognise as independent states both south ossetia and abkhazia
8135474 for oil traders it is another weekend of storm watch
8135475 the new estimates which reflect improvements in internationally comparable price data offer a much more accurate picture of the cost of living in developing countries and set a new poverty line of 1 25 a day
8135476 high gdp growth in india has reduced poverty however to achieve a higher rate of poverty reduction india will also need to address inequalities in opportunities that impede the poor from participating in the growth process
8135477 siamo pronti a fare la class action gi dal primo gennaio
8135478 sta succedendo come con il banco di napoli spiegano dove 12 000 miliardi di debiti sono finiti a carico dello stato e tutti i privati si godranno gli utili
8135479 ormai siamo arrivati al ridicolo con un piano di intesa lacrime e sangue purtroppo la class action stata rimandata al primo gennaio aggiungono ma per quella data saremo pronti

8135482 what it took for him to get here was something i never thought id see in my life
8135483 hes been working all summer hes on the phone all the time
8135484 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8135485 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8135486 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8135487 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8135488 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8135489 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8135490 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8135491 with the private hospital programs ending and the population of lake county growing in general the demand continues to increase
8135492 we generally have 100 to 200 people on our call in waiting list at any point in time
8135493 were still working on trying to interview all staff who are affected to look at what else is available in the rest of the health department
8135494 this will severely impair a moms ability to undergo treatment
8135495 we work with 100 women per year and half of them have kids that they bring into treatment with them
8135496 many of those individuals need short stays at the addiction treatment program
8135497 those services will just be less available to the court as they are less available to anybody else
8135498 we work one to two years ahead on grants this significant
8135499 this has affected a lot of our county partners and its also affected our colleagues in the city who provide similar services
8135500 we probably need to work on assessing who has what to assist our patient needs with any patient that were not able to serve we look at what is available in the rest of the community
8135501 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8135502 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8135503 libraries suffer from cramming too much stuff into too small of an area
8135504 it offers the opportunity to provide the library with free heating once the wells are paid off
8135505 we think we are one of the most valuable things in this community and we want to stay that way
8135506 we thought more people would be able to participate in this
8135507 sometimes its tough to get here because of the traffic
8135508 its nice theyre inviting the community to be part of the building
8135509 were excited for the branch but well still come here too
8135510 we came to retrieve those last books before school i was happy to sign
8135511 thats what youve been elected for you figure it out
8135512 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
8135513 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
8135514 weve had community members come to us who went to school in u 46 mobiles and now their children and grandchildren are going through the same thing just how long is temporary
8135515 when they have a school that is under capacity why are we not giving the parents the choice their kids could be bused to a less crowded school
8135516 i always get anxious with the start of year probably more so than the students
8135517 every day since july 1 i have tried to enter the building from a different door to find my way around
8135518 someone can tell you what its like to walk into neuqua valley for your first day as principal but you dont know until you walk through those doors yourself
8135519 were going to keep our traditions intact and were going to make a new one challenging every student every day
8135520 there seems to be great deal of pride in having those events
8135521 theres a deliberateness about bringing adults together at the school to celebrate student achievement
8135522 whether its a student mastering a new skill or a teacher learning a new technique were going to do it with excellence
8135523 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
8135524 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
8135525 having fun learning the more were different the more were the same
8135526 when it happened it was something that was seen as a tragedy and it kind of held people back where now people acknowledge it for what it was and use it as a steppingstone to move on
8135527 ill never forget but its not in the back of my mind anymore
8135528 the board believes that dr egans proven track record of success at the high school coupled with his unsurpassed dedication to the children of district 95 make him a great candidate for taking our district to even greater levels of achievement
8135529 i think the challenges are getting the facilities issues straightened out
8135530 theres some long range facilities planning that we need to follow through on the work doesnt scare me and im looking forward to it
8135531 thats something that dr knutson and i will be working on together
8135532 ur wrong again damn u cant do any thing wright
8135533 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8135534 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8135535 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8135536 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8135537 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8135538 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8135539 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8135540 essentially the 790gx will fill the midrange gap where the 790x failed to gain ground itll offer more features and better overclocking from the new sb750 southbridge but depending on what price the few 790fx and sb750 boards arrive at it or whether ati pulls its finger out in hybrid power it will be make or break as to whether the 790gx is ever appealing or not theres just no point to expensive hybrid crossfire
8135541 the biggest thing we can do is be reliable and efficient
8135542 if you want to go to a specific address we will take you right there if thats what you need we would be the right choice for you
8135543 one of the things i felt important for the transit system was to get the word out to let people know we have it
8135544 you get to be friends with the passengers and talk to them i enjoy it very much
8135545 i truly believe we can meet the demand no matter how high it gets
8135546 the first of the units we will be taking a close look at is the everest 80plus 700 with fsps newest lines of power supplies their main goal is not only providing a lot of power but providing efficiency with the world in this whole green thing and people wanting to save as much power and money this new unit maybe right up your alley especially if you are in the need of a power supply that can power a dual nvidia gpu gaming rig nvidia has certified the everest plus80 as sli compatible
8135547 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8135548 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8135549 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8135550 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8135551 one of the things our government wont tolerate and after 9 11 our citizens wont tolerate is trying to use americans as punching bags or targets for terrorist acts or mindless acts
8135552 theres sort of this involuntary clench in my back when theres a car behind me and i cant see it
8135553 you dont want him to call any witnesses on your behalf
8135554 he was a really naive kid who wouldnt hurt a fly
8135555 bass pro means we are a very big fishing store but we have more than that we also have large hunting apparel and footwear departments
8135556 id be interested in shopping there because i like the outdoors and id be interested in learning more about future fishing events and activities
8135557 the purpose of seminars is to educate children in the outdoors and provide more learning experiences for novice people
8135558 we try to be involved in communities and schools around us the bgsu cheerleaders were here for the grand opening and we are always looking for more ways to be part of the community
8135559 next year we will be really involved with the national tractor pull that takes place in bowling green including providing shuttles to and from the location
8135560 the first thing everyone does upon entering the store is look up because its not a normal ceiling the store is full of murals that are hand painted by several different artists
8135561 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
8135562 you only had the best of the best taking the test
8135563 although the choice to use local transportation may have cost more money it proved to be a life saving one
8135564 she had the great presence of mind to get us out of there
8135565 she just got shot at her daughters in the hospital and shes helping us
8135566 insistir en la moderaci n salarial puede generar m s conflictividad
8135567 the truth is within the space of our lifetimes much of what we once almost universally abhorred has been packaged perfumed gift wrapped and sold to us as though it has great value by skilfully playing on our deeply felt values of fairness generosity and tolerance marketers have persuaded us to embrace as enlightened and noble that which previous generations regarded as grossly self destructive in a word evil
8135568 from pitching promiscuity as freedom to promoting abortion as choice the marketers of evil are always selling you something destructive with catastrophic results

8135574 of u tijdens de voorverkiezingen nu voor mij of voor barack obama heeft gekozen doet er niet toe
8135575 het is tijd voor eenheid met n enkel doel barack obama is mijn kandidaat en hij moet onze president worden
8135576 we willen geen john mccain als president als obama in het witte huis zit zal hij onze economie tot leven brengen hij zal de amerikaanse werknemers verdedigen en de wereldwijde uitdagingen van onze tijd aangaan
8135577 de democraten weten hoe je zoiets doet ik weet nog hoe president clinton en de vroegere democraten dat in het verleden hebben gedaan en obama zal dat opnieuw doen
8135578 wie gisteren de speech van michelle heeft gehoord weet dat ze een fantastische first lady zal zijn joe biden is een solide leider en een goed mens
8135579 they still have players in there who have got the job done
8135580 even with them out of there i think you kind of keep in mind that the way theyve been playing theres no letdown regardless of whos in there
8135581 i was just a little too anxious i was trying to do too much on the mound

8135592 i really do think that bakeries are a dying breed because people want to make their money the easier way
8135593 its easier to sit at a computer or to be in an office than to have to get up at midnight and come to work
8135594 we have one man that always comes in for prune danish
8135595 and we only make two of them every day so i always know what he wants when he comes in its kind of his reserve but he only buys one
8135596 i think when you feel it is when the customer comes in and goes wow look at that cake
8135597 other agencies use badges and other simple identification forms to give the public a clue of which agency theyre with i think thats a much more judicious use of taxpayer money than fancy jackets
8135598 if you want an example why taxpayers do not trust government im hard pressed to think of a better example than this
8135599 we want to represent the type of professional we want to place
8135600 internally i think it helps our staff feel better about what they do
8135601 maybe training the employees to do a better job auditing their programs would be a better investment than buying vests and sportcoats

8135614 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
8135615 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
8135616 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8135617 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8135618 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8135619 this is a fabrication by the sudanese government and some criminals
8135620 we denounce and condemn this act we want the protection of civilians wherever they are this is a dirty conspiracy to defame

8135645 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
8135646 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
8135647 i am honored to have the historic opportunity to nominate sen barack obama to be the next president of the united states of america
8135648 this is denver this is the southwest and there is a significant hispanic population here and salazar resonates well with them

8135657 thatll take care of itself i just have to go out there and play my game and show the coaches and the personnel people the progress ive made both with my injury and as a football player
8135658 its tough but normally if you let them play theyll tell you
8135659 for the most part we know what our roster will look like but there are a couple of guys that could gain a little bit of ground they realize that they know exactly who they are
8135660 located at 119 north fourth street at the corners of north 4
8135661 in minnesotas 5th congressional district also joining us on sunday is

8135664 if the president is not exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama were going to have somebody who answers that phone
8135665 living in the richest country in the world wouldnt you think youd have a better life
8135666 oh i just wanted to show you that if soccer is good enough for my cubs its good enough for me
8135667 hopefully she goes through the program graduates and then the charges will be dismissed
8135668 immediately after the tremors in irkutsk there were cuts in electricity mobile connections and the internet banks postponed work some houses lost roofs
8135669 there were no reports of serious destruction or casualties thank god
8135670 nu pot sa discut despre acest sondaj din moment ce diferenta ntre cei doi este n marja de eroare
8135671 let him who is without sin cast the first stone
8135672 send notice to these so called dispensaries to tell them that they are in violation of federal law
8135673 hopefully the feds will back off in instances where people are really following these guidelines
8135674 i have prayed for him for years such a brilliant mind and he will not acknowledge the god who gave it to him
8135675 duh sorry coach left fields been empty through the first inning
8135676 if i had a dog as ugly as you id shave his butt and teach him to walk backwards
8135677 trick out your bird of prey with green flame decals to show off when i decloak to pwn federation nubs
8135678 im going to be a straight shooter and say it like i see it and maintain that philosophy
8135679 im somebody whos really honest and gives an opinion if i feel i need to be hard i will be and if i feel i need to be more nurturing i will be
8135680 the track starts out sounding like chris brown singing a max martin penned backstreet ballad before blossoming into a lush chorus reminiscent of jojos too little too late
8135681 anyone who had that aussie tracksuit on you said hello to them galvez said
8135682 when youre away from home that team becomes your family and you really try to make everyone feel at home
8135683 would you believe i fainted on the last day and i wasnt able to go
8135684 they even took me to the clinic in an ambulance for tests
8135685 apparently i was suffering from dehydration just had a bit of a travellers bug but they still wouldnt let me go
8135686 it was a bit hard because even the doctor treating me ended up going to the closing ceremony but stayed on call in case i needed him
8135687 i dont want samak say this word no one died in government house
8135688 what i can say is that right now in this present moment she is disease free
8135689 he goes no no no it cant be cancer he thought it was pneumonia or something
8135690 they sit me in this cold little waiting room and he the doctor comes back in and says they found a mass
8135691 i say to people do people actually live like this you go to bed when you like you get up in the morning and then you have breakfast then you read and go for a walk and come back and read some more
8135692 then you put the fire on sit in front of it and watch the tv i thought if this is the way some people live or how they do when theyre sick then im happy to be sick forever it becomes addictive
8135693 i suppose its a little slower than i thought but as the doctor said to me the other day it wasnt an operation it was an excavation
8135694 i cant expect to be up and doing marathons straight away and its only five weeks since the operation im managing well and they seemed to have got all the cancer
8135695 im doing some tests this week ive got a bit of soreness because i had robotic surgery which is fairly invasive
8135696 the doctor said of the area that is sore thats where i went after you so i suppose i have to be prepared to pay a bit of a price but im doing all right
8135697 there are side affects you have to deal with but thats the choice the choice is between vanity and life and i chose life
8135698 but i dont want to go into the bit to do ive had to do with him
8135699 but ive interviewed little matthew and i said at the time when they were talking about gold medals for everybody else that this was the fellow that could really upset the apple cart
8135700 he had been to hell and back on many occasions and much has been made of him leaving the sport and all ill say to you is i can assure you it wasnt a voluntary thing and there were very significant pressure from administrators in relation to this young fellow
8135701 i think for him to know hes come out of the olympic games with the greatest dive in the history of the olympic movement gives him a permanent place in the history of the olympic games
8135702 kajian itb menyebutkan lambatnya perkembangan ekonomi di daerah karena kurangnya infrastruktur transportasi yang memadai

8135707 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right
8135708 we are very excited to bring the fourth annual harvest hustle to the village this year
8135709 this event gives us the opportunity to promote healthy activities for our residents while raising money to support important initiatives
8135710 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
8135711 has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters
8135712 i say it with force by abandoning the afghan people to their bad luck and their tormentors by abandoning out democratic allies and our responsibilities as a permanent member of the united nations security council we would be in a way abandoning the security of the french people and our status as a great power
8135713 the combat that they are leading in afghanistan is a just combat a combat that we must not lose
8135714 for them the goal is to hit our spirits to cut our forces off from the support of public opinion to sow doubts in western public opinion so that certain countries leave
8135715 its not because you have extra drones or helicopters that youll avoid that talibans who are hidden in the mountains appear and decide to launch an operation
8135716 in such zones human intelligence is more important than technical intelligence
8135717 the bookies in the u k have been pretty poor performers recently paddy powers certainly held up better than they have
8135718 paddy power are the only listed retail growth story right now in the u k
8135719 can couple that top line growth with improved operational performance it could make a meaningful contribution to earnings growth
8135720 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8135721 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8135722 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8135723 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
8135724 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8135725 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
8135726 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
8135727 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8135728 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8135729 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
8135730 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8135731 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
8135732 those who aligned todd with spiritual fathers should have realized to do so publicly was a mistake
8135733 and could be interpreted by those watching in no other way than as a complete endorsement
8135734 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8135735 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8135736 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8135737 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
8135738 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
8135739 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
8135740 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
8135741 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
8135742 he has taken on the whole bn machinery and all the resources at their disposal and come out tops
8135743 there are factors that we have to be practical about but this does not mean that he is enjoying full support elsewhere in the country
8135744 he is the winner here because this is his hometown and the timing of the elections is to his advantage because umnos party polls will be held in a month
8135745 i dont think so in the last general election the people gave the barisan nasional the mandate to rule so if the opposition wants to form a government they will have to wait for the next general election
8135746 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
8135747 i thank the voters the wisdom of the people has prevailed the win shows the people reject the sodomy allegations thrown at my husband
8135748 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8135749 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8135750 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war but we of course dont want it
8135751 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners in the west
8135752 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision and the situation will be calm
8135753 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8135754 the black sea is just a small pool for their arms with the range of 2 500 kilometers
8135755 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8135756 it is the first attempt in europe since nazi germany and stalin of a big country to annex the territory of another country
8135757 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted to oppose it to the west
8135758 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
8135759 the bonds have ben set low enough so that we believe that most people will bond out in a relatively short time
8135760 there was no warning we werent coming at them they were coming at us
8135761 we must remain nonviolent we must have the high moral ground
8135762 theres a powerful police presence here the chill of 1968 is in the air of denver
8135763 located at 119 north fourth street at the corners of north 4
8135764 in minnesotas 5th congressional district also joining us on sunday is
8135765 we need the support of the people and the gop and other republican party candidates state wide to ensure an across the board win for minnesotas republican party
8135766 the county was put in an awkward position because of the lawsuits but i really do think its just about over
8135767 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
8135768 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8135769 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8135770 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8135771 the application failed to intialize properly click ok to terminate
8135772 there are very few historical buildings as old as the cook museum in the area these dresses each bring back a little life to the history of libertyville
8135773 like everything in the house it took a while to put the dresses together again
8135774 it took me about three or four years to put together each of the dresses that have been up on display since 2003
8135775 when i first saw the dress i thought oh my theres a hole in this dress i have to mend
8135776 then i discovered the small pocket was meant for a lay down which is a tiny flat glass bottle the owner of the dress would have filled with a type of perfume
8135777 many women would have worn their wedding dresses after their wedding day
8135778 back then some women would have only owned three nice dresses which they wore over and over again and couldnt wash
8135779 you go through it once and you think you see everything
8135780 theres so many little things you come upon you just cant imagine the history
8135781 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
8135782 you only had the best of the best taking the test
8135783 we are working with fema to get to the bottom of it
8135784 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
8135785 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
8135786 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
8135787 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
8135788 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
8135789 pulling back from something outlandish is easier than trying to convince yourself that the dull idea that has appeared in front of you is worth pursuing
8135790 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
8135791 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
8135792 why the government felt it was necessary to create a new liability provision only for lessons is not clear infringement is infringement yet bill c 61 establishes an entire new class of infringement specifically for lessons

8135795 this new episode of harassment and persecution is occurring just as porno para ricardo is in the middle of recording its new record which eliminates any possibility that this repressive escalation could be described as a coincidence
8135796 in cuba the voice of the brave is silenced by the regime which doesnt hesitate to use intimidation and force
8135797 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
8135798 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians

8135800 were bewildered at the extreme level of activity of nato naval forces in the black sea which continue to increase their numbers
8135801 only yesterday i said there were nine nato ships in the sea and by evening another frigate of the us navy passed through the bosphorus straits
8135802 we have also learnt that another eight warships from nato states are expected shortly
8135803 they talk about planned exercises and you can probably find some legitimacy in that but its very hard to believe that all the visits so far have been bringing only humanitarian aid
8135804 while russia shows adherence to the achieved international agreement tbilisi continues to revive its armed forces
8135805 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
8135806 theyve established some self declared security zones observation posts check points and things of that nature
8135807 would be a reflection of them not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
8135808 i immediately got up and introduced myself to him and we had a nice talk before i returned to my table which was people from ohio
8135809 i met cincinnati mayor mark mallory at the airport and his parents and started meeting several people from ohio on the plane who were going to denver for the convention
8135810 economic development will be a priority the next four years
8135811 will give the usw international and the usw bargaining committee the authority to call a strike if it becomes necessary
8135812 i cannot stress enough how important these two meetings are for our union members we have been negotiating with arcelormittal for the past 14 weeks and unfortunately are now at this point but i will provide a complete and detailed report to the membership at the two meetings and we will decide at that point what direction we will take
8135813 at all arcelormittal plants in the united states for the more than 14 000 steelworkers covered by this basic labor agreement
8135814 it is more important than ever that we all stand strong and send a unified message to the company that the steelworkers will not back down and will not go away we continue to stand by our commitment to bring back a contract that provides the employment security earnings security and retirement security that we need and deserve
8135815 it is extremely important to attain these cornerstone issues in a new labor agreement and we need investment in our facilities so we can stay on the cutting edge of technology
8135816 we have witnessed the severe pain of our retirees suffering because of the weirton steel bankruptcy and the pension plan termination as well as the loss of their health care
8135817 the pattern was set this month with the new contract with u s steel we must remain united on these issues in order to obtain the contract that meets our goals
8135818 that provides very significant wage substantial bonus and pension increases and improves benefit programs for active employees and retirees as well as reduces health care premiums for retirees
8135819 weve gone through some tough times in the steel industry during the last 20 years
8135820 our union was instrumental in restructuring the industry and this new contract rewards our members for their hard work improves the living standards of our retirees and the capital investments that will be made in our mills protect our communities far into the future this contract is the new standard in the industry
8135821 yet the company arcelormittal continues to demand a 39 percent increase and the company still has not agreed to a continuation of adequate funding for our voluntary employee beneficiary association trust fund
8135822 continue to demand a new financial incentive program that would reduce incentives and force us to make new improvements just to get back to our current levels of pay
8135823 nach einer studie der unabh ngigen international union against cancer k nnen die wenigsten leute einsch tzen welche faktoren tats chlich unser krebsrisiko erh hen und welche uns davor sch tzen auch die frage ob krebs berhaupt heilbar ist beantwortete nicht jeder befragte mit ja
8135824 wer bereits einmal ein basaliom hatte also einen nicht melan sen hautkrebs der ist nach dessen entfernung keinesfalls auf der sicheren seite eine studie im fachmagazin journal of the national cancer institute kommt zu dem schluss dass solche personen ein doppelt so hohes risiko tragen sp ter an einem b sartigen krebs zu erkranken
8135825 aber den augeninnendruck sollten wir doch schon bei ihnen messen denken sie einmal an die gefahr eines glaukoms
8135826 wir empfehlen ihnen dringend mit einem psa test ihr risiko einer prostataerkrankung abzusch tzen
8135827 wer wundert sich noch warum pseudowissenschaften wie hom opathie und astrologie immer fester in der gesellschaft verankert sind wenn mit der propaganda schon bei kleinen kindern angefangen wird
8135828 es ist doch unglaublich in welchem ausma heutzutage in papers gest ckelt gemogelt und zurechtgebogen wird und alle decken sich augenzwinkernd gegenseitig
8135829 i recognize and appreciate the hard work of the sponsors in passing this legislation
8135830 however i cannot sign this legislation because it raises taxes on consumers
8135831 el padrino entre el poder de hollywood y el de la mafia
8135832 he was almost done he was ready to get out
8135833 i must say however that if they were left alone together my car would definitely kick your cars ass and your cute mini would run home crying little tears of washer fluid
8135834 my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8135835 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8135836 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8135837 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8135838 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care and fighting for womens rights to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfills the hopes of our people
8135839 a strong leader a good man who understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad
8135840 im a united states senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in seneca falls new york many traveling for days and nights to participate in the first convention on womens rights in our history and so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter and a few sons and grandsons along the way these women and men looked into their daughters eyes imagined a fairer and freer world and found the strength to fight to rally and picket to endure ridicule and harassment to brave violence and jail and after so many decades 88 years ago on this very day the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our constitution my mother was born before women could vote but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8135841 have been financed by islamic charities of the iranian regime based in california and by the silicon iran network
8135842 in exchange the senator does his best to aid the mullahs
8135843 i believe than an improved relationship with iran is in the naked self interest of the united states of america
8135844 we had hoped that after the 11 september attacks the iranian regime would end its support for terrorists
8135845 but iran did not stop its support for terror indeed the hard line elements of the iranian regime facilitated the movement of terrorists escaping from afghanistan
8135846 biden has been too cozy with the supporters of the iranian regime which is anti american anti iranian and has a horrendous human rights record
8135847 this is because the iranians instead of empowering the lobby supporting them undermine it
8135848 senator joseph biden said that even if iran was a full democracy like india it would want nuclear capability like india what the world needed to address was irans emotional needs he said with a nonaggression pact
8135849 he really impressed us by his grasp of world affairs
8135850 he encouraged us to make our views known and to get more involved in american politics
8135851 iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the u s
8135852 as iranian americans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism
8135853 mr youssefi has earned the reputation of being a vocal supporter of iran us rapprochement and d tente
8135854 in march of 2000 he created fairpac the foundation for american iranian rapprochement a political advocacy council as a means of informing and educating interested persons everywhere of the benefits of improved u s iran relations
8135855 iapac has no relationship with the islamic republic of iran and is not focused on u s policy towards iran establishing ties with or legitimizing the government of iran
8135856 highlights the need to really investigate the web of iranian influence in the united states
8135857 what you have here is a group of people who have been working together through different groups and organizations for the past ten years
8135858 its deeply troubling to have a vice presidential candidate raise funds from people whose ties to the iranian regime raise such serious questions
8135859 last night we all got stuck in featherston because our mate ran out of petrol if you want a ride somewhere now it costs more petrols 15 a lift not 10
8135860 i think you can be too long in anything and its good to have a change
8135861 if i had a baby now heaven forbid youre not allowed to smack your child why should they tell me what to do thats one thing i object to were in a nanny state and i dont want people to tell me how to bring my child up a woman who has never had any children telling me how to bring my children up
8135862 ive voted winston peters and last time it was labour but im undecided about what im going to do now at the moment im probably tending national i dont think economic circumstances are as good as they were in our days
8135863 it is a little bit of a struggle at the moment
8135864 i dont know who i am going to vote for this year ive always gone with labour im doing a big toss up because i really dont like john key at all but i think labour needs a bit of a kick in the pants id like to vote someone else in just so they labour could get their act together again and reassess what theyre doing
8135865 to be honest it is hard to gauge how people are thinking but i know that john hayes has done a lot of work in the community
8135866 the more national promote this new broadband internet thing they want to do then theyre going to pick up a heap of votes our internet here is disgusting they said theyre going to spend 2 million re running the cables so hey theyll also get my vote because theyve worked very hard here
8135867 the problem at the moment is most people dont know which way to go because national havent given us many policies yet and a lot of people have had a gutsful of labour we dont know whether were going to jump out of the frying pan and into the fire or vice versa
8135868 oil markets are keeping a nervous eye on hurricane gustav with forecasts showing it may move into the gulf of mexico
8135869 as well diplomatic tensions involving russia have intensified following russias decision to recognise as independent states both south ossetia and abkhazia
8135870 for oil traders it is another weekend of storm watch
8135871 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8135872 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8135873 were talking about a very serious issue here that also has huge economic implications
8135874 unfortunately we have no policy framework and there are so many agencies involved with very little coordination between them blame must be shared equally at the institutional level the engineering level and the consumer level
8135875 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers
8135876 our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about fuel efficiency and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
8135877 canon 917 a person who has already received the most holy eucharist can receive it a second time on the same day only within the eucharistic celebration in which the person participates
8135878 its important there are maori views in parliament ill look to them but i havent really heard what theyve promised for people ive heard labour is guaranteeing no interest on student loans i was thinking thats a good thing thatll pull me their way
8135879 to make sure our children dont become what the media think
8135880 when i was in year 9 they werent going anywhere after they left school
8135881 i know what goes down on a friday night in a small town i think they do as much as they can to keep the buzz going
8135882 the huge land losses the social cultural economic and political marginalisation of maori society and mass migration to the cities from 1950 onwards
8135883 i grew up in ponsonby but i come from here
8135884 but its getting faster its getting rougher you dont realise it until you move away from it
8135885 kaikohe is the home turf for shane jones and hone harawira
8135886 and those guys are here all the time they support church marae local initiatives
8135887 thats missing now there are no set foundations they dont grow up with the values our people grew up with in the beginning
8135888 ive never ever made up my mind until ive reached the booth but weve been listening to the parliament channel and getting a really good laugh from it and i cant hear strength from john key i listen for strength and their policies and i cant hear any strength
8135889 he just thought it would be a good place to bring up kids its out of the concrete jungle kaikohe is kind of like an old shoe now its comfortable isnt it its got everything you want lifestyle climate and its a good town
8135890 i looked at what was being imported to the town and decided to make trailers youre only limited by your imagination
8135891 do not worry about tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself sufficient for a day is its own evil
8135892 in recognition of her sublime unparalleled voice and unique stylistic versatility
8135893 connoisseurs and the general public alike have been dazzled by the beauty of her soft and natural voice which is equally supple in every register and exudes sensitivity in every tone
8135894 for their monumental contribution over the decades to the fusion of art and music in the development of popular culture
8135895 through extensive sonic experimentation they captured the mood and spirit of a whole generation in their reflections and attitudes
8135896 because of the role that ones address plays in the electoral system new york state law requires voters to notify the board of elections within 25 days of an address change to preserve their voting rights
8135897 what in the world is that ancient custom i dont understand that
8135898 whenever im about to do something i think would an idiot do that and if they would i do
8135899 if we catch a democrat saying something inaccurate or embarrassing were on top of it
8135900 when you talk to democrats theres a lot of disunity
8135901 they are not sold on their message they are not sold on their candidates
8135902 he said he was going to be back in the office as soon as he could and i guess he kept that promise
8135903 you come here for 36 years in a row i guess its a hard habit to break
8135904 i lost all my hair but other than that im in pretty good shape
8135905 so far i havent felt very sick ive felt pretty good although it saps your energy some
8135906 hes getting a little short on hair and wearing a baseball cap but thats the style now right
8135907 i am writing to you to urge you to oppose an exemption for india from the rules of the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group nsg
8135908 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
8135909 the us india nuclear agreement effectively grants india the privileges of nuclear weapons states nws despite the fact that india developed nuclear weapons outside the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt regime the agreement doesnt even require india to accept the same responsibilities as other states i e full scope iaea safeguards for non nws and a commitment from nws to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of nuclear weapons
8135910 when we travel to places whose people and cultures are far away from our comfort zone we have no option but to grow stretch and reach out we learn that our assumptions and world views are often limited unintentionally biased and prejudiced and that we have incredible opportunities to become the people that we often dream about the gift of travel is one of the greatest gifts because it invites and entices all our senses to observe learn and become enriched
8135911 from that moment onwards i decided that i would open doors for others to experience india and all that it has to offer
8135912 i realized india had so much to offer the western world
8135913 i want to be a messenger to those who may be unhappy sad confused lost stressed that it is easy to be the opposite happy peaceful calm joyous
8135914 i love operating my company because of all the great people that i get to meet and work with
8135915 i love it because unlike academia where entrepreneurship innovation and creativity is often slowed down or looked down upon i can run with my strengths typically every day is a learning day every single day you learn something new you learn about yourself a little more and you have an opportunity to serve others meet their needs go the extra mile and become one of the most admired companies
8135916 india like human beings is a glaring dichotomy of virtues and vices systems and chaos successes and failures dreams and dashed hopes good and bad opulence and poverty it is a country that exposes its strengths and frailties in a rich yet stark way i love india because it has so much to offer but you must be thirsty to drink from the well it is not for everyone it is for the adventurous it is for those who are willing to step outside their comfort zone it is for those who are willing to test and then adjust their assumptions it is for those who are open to new experiences
8135917 thought i would drop you a line to keep you up to date on my recovery i havent touched a drop sinc
8135918 atmosfera primo scudetto irripetibile santacroce presto in nazionale ho letto critiche a rinaudo ma un buon difensore
8135919 e stata allestita sicuramente una buona squadra sono arrivati dei rinforzi allaltezza della piazza e c zalayeta che sta recuperando a tempi di record ritengo sia fondamentale nello scacchiere tattico del napoli
8135920 penso di si numericamente ci siamo ci sono pi di 20 giocatori in rosa in ogni ruolo ci sono varie alternative e ci innesca anche tra i calciatori una costruttiva competizione e li sprona ad allenarsi sempre con la giusta concentrazione per un calciatore gli stimoli sono fondamentali
8135921 nel calcio moderno i nostri giovani sono sempre meno apprezzati si tende sempre ad investire su stranieri quando poi la nostra scuola la migliore al mondo bisogna avere coraggio e dare la possibilit ai nostri giovani di esprimersi e di non buttarli nel dimenticatoio anche a vitale spero gli diano la possibilit di giocare senza eccessive pressioni e forse potr anche esplodere come giocatore
8135922 santacroce ha grandi mezzi personalmente lho visto giocare a genova contro la samp e devo dire che in quella circostanza non fece toccare nemmeno un pallone a cassano prestazione da incorniciare devo dire che mi sorprese per il senso di applicazione con il quale affrontava la partita sempre molto agile e soprattutto in anticipo doti che ti portano a vestire presto lazzurro della nazionale a mio avviso santacroce gi sarebbe pronto per questo tipo di discorso
8135923 fu un anno particolare per me non si ripeteranno mai pi scene di quel genere il napoli potr vincere anche altri scudetti ma il primo avr un valore sempre unico si era creato un giusto mix su tutti gli aspetti da quello ambientale a quello tecnico e societario grazie ai nostri tifosi sembrava che giocassimo sempre in casa una macchia azzurra in tutti gli stadi avversari che ci ospitavano mi vengono ancora i brividi quando penso alla magica vittoria a torino contro la juventus erano anni che il napoli non espugnava il campo bianconero nonostante fossimo andati in svantaggio tra di noi cera la consapevolezza di poter ribaltare lincontro in ogni azione maradona ci dava una carica incredibile in campo un vero leader e poi la spinta delle 30000 anime azzurre era qualcosa di eccezionale quando segnai il terzo gol ci fu il tripudio assoluto corsi come un pazzo sotto la curva napoletana se ci penso mi viene la pelle doca unatmosfera unica e irripetibile
8135924 approdai in maglia azzurra con la benedizione di allodi e marino ma il nostro direttore fu colto da un grave malore per questo al suo posto arriv come nuovo ds luciano moggi che port in maglia azzurra altri 4 5 innesti tra cui francini e corradini io non rientravo nei suoi piani cosi scelsi di accettare la proposta del verona guidato dal mister osvaldo bagnoli mio grande estimatore stravedeva per me purtroppo questo il rischio che corre ogni giocatore il giorno prima essere leroe della causa e il giorno dopo essere ceduto al migliore offerente inizialmente avevo un po il dente avvelenato perch sapevo di poter dare ancora molto alla causa azzurra ma con gli anni e con maggiore esperienza ho capito che le cose nel calcio non sempre vanno come speri la mia carriera comunque si chiusa con tante soddisfazioni tra cui una finale in uefa centrata con la maglia della fiorentina
8135925 molti dicevano che diego non si allenava proprio non era affatto cosi anzi aveva uno spirito di dedizione unico in allenamento sempre puntuale e professionale almeno nel periodo nel quale siamo stati compagni di squadra in allenamento faceva cose strabilianti un giocoliere palleggiava con palla da calcio balilla arancia con tutto dico con grande soddisfazione di aver avuto la possibilit di giocare con il pi grande giocatore di calcio della storia
8135926 ho affrontato moltissimi campioni con diego sono stato avversario nel suo primo anno a napoli e non ho assolutamente demeritato rummenigge nelle sue movenze era anche lui un giocatore di livello assoluto in generale forse non ho avuto tanti problemi con i grossi campioni ma piuttosto con calciatori di categorie inferiori verso fine carriera forse ho collezionato anche qualche brutta figura poich non affrontavo le gare con la giusta concentrazione
8135927 a parte santacroce di cui abbiamo parlato prima credo che anche hamsik possa consacrarsi se si esprime a questi livelli il napoli parte gi con una marcia in pi
8135928 per come ha operato in fase di mercato dico genoa ci sono tutte le prerogative per fare grandi cose societ solida calciatori giovani affiancati da talenti come gasbarroni e palladino e soprattutto un tecnico molto preparato come gasperini un allenatore equilibrato che non si deprime di fronte alle difficolt e che garantisce alla societ sempre continuit nei risultati
8135929 santacroce merita la nazionale napoli sorpresa del campionato esordio a
8135930 pocho lavezzi mi fa impazzire darei fiducia a vitale sogno sempre il gol
8135931 napoli ha le qualit per fare bene in europa consigliai maradona a ferla
8135932 napoli sar a ridosso della champions nuovi arrivati sono di grande valore
8135933 napoli prendi pasqual punterei sulla voglia di riscatto di de zerbi deni
8135934 russotto ha grandissimi numeri messi sarebbe per napoli il nuovo maradona
8135935 denis un grande giocatore far tantissimi gol banega da napoli
8135936 pi maturato molto sente la fiducia pu essere il suo anno
8135937 avrebbe preferito il rinnovo ora resta alla lazio e lanno prossimo
8135938 mercato chiuso giovedi saremo al pari di milan samp e udinese noi che eravamo a lanciano
8135939 denis un grande giocatore far tantissimi gol banega da napoli

8135942 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8135943 proud supporter of obama clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8135944 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8135945 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8135946 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8135947 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8135948 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8135949 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8135950 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8135951 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8135952 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8135953 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8135954 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8135955 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8135956 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8135957 ive never been more fired up the reason i supported hillary clinton came out in every word
8135958 were going to leave unified but then the real fight starts
8135959 a budget surplus peace and prosperity and record numbers of new jobs
8135960 its such an international game that the opportunities to play rugby around the world are great
8135961 i cant imagine anything better over the next four to five years than maybe to end up in japan or wales or italy or france
8135962 whether i get on the field or not ive had a great ride over the last 10 seasons
8135963 it would be a big win if we could do it but all we can guarantee is that well go out and give it everything not just count down the minutes in the game until the end of the season but just go out and enjoy the challenge of playing against a great side
8135964 this week well go out to compete and play at our best and the expectation is probably not that were a great chance to win but anything can happen
8135965 you go out to get your match ups as good as you can get them give players great opportunities and you expect them to do their best
8135966 the hardest day they are ever going to have in their life
8135967 we are going to lap that up thats one thing for sure
8135968 its a great learning environment for a lot of our players it will be a great learning environment for me
8135969 mark thompson has made a statement that is really directed at the geelong players more than at us
8135970 so hes dealing with his side and theyre going through a lot of different emotions this week and hell deal with it in his own way and im interested to sit back and look at how he deals with that and what impact it has

8135980 it has been a contributing factor in that i havent been able to get out on the park but its more that i feel that the club is going in a different direction with the young players coming through and i dont want to be in their way
8135981 i still havent made a final decision about playing footy again next year
8135982 with the global credit crunch and bear market entering its second year and with little end in sight we believe this is placing ongoing pressure on macquaries businesses and outlook ubs analyst jonathan mott said in a note to clients
8135983 globally we expect weaker equities volumes investment banking pipelines and softer commodities trading opportunities placing further pressure on macquaries revenues
8135984 i have no knowledge of where and by whom any donation to new zealand first was requested
8135985 and i have received an explanation which is that he refutes the suggestion
8135986 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8135987 helen clark must stand mr peters down as a minister that is what i would do if i were prime minister helen clark has stood ministers from labour down for much less
8135988 unless he peters can provide a credible explanation about this serious issue he should be unacceptable to helen clark as a minister in her labour led government
8135989 mr glenns letter represents a direct challenge to mr peters credibility from the only other person in the world in a position to know the facts
8135990 this match is going to help me because it was so challenging
8135991 i was missing a lot of match practice so i got a tough one today
8135992 i thought i served well and really moved good for the first round i went on a good roll
8135993 this takes a little bit of pressure off me because i know a little more about where my game is at
8135994 what in the world is that ancient custom i dont understand that
8135995 the message was awesome today i walked in not thinking this was an area i struggled with and walked out absolutely shocked at what god had shown me
8135996 i have spiritual struggles like the next person and really didnt know why until the series enemy within every morning before each one of those messages i told myself im not going to church i dont want to go and on the way i wanted to turn around and go home but i made it it is amazing
8135997 its strange i constantly want to show kindness and mercy to them i dont get that some people never forgive somebody for somewhat minor offenses yet i constantly want to forgive and move on even when the offense s are a pretty major deal
8135998 what you looking at me for i didnt come to stay
8135999 bastion of bigotry against men that has thrown its influence and prestige into violating the rights of men by offering a womens studies program but no mens studies program
8136000 the courses pretty much treat guys as if theyre sources of evil in the world and the women are victims
8136001 im using the same argument here as we have with title ix when a university receives government funding they have to provide equal opportunities for men and women if theres no mens studies womens studies is unconstitutional
8136002 thats going to be a knife to the heart of darkness of it
8136003 refrain from arresting or citing pot smokers during the convention
8136004 but were not bigots or homophobes thats what they want you to think
8136005 youre not one of us youre not part of the club

8136008 no one can do more to harm to the democratic party than democrats
8136009 when people say that we say not here and were not going to hear it because were a united party in the state and in the country
8136010 we must realize that we have to overcome the rough feelings and come together to stop the bush policies
8136011 ce sa iti spun e un partid de doi lei se trezeste unul vorbind si apoi noi ceilalti trebuie sa dam explicatii nu va fi nici o motiune
8136012 este o mare nervozitate in partid si de aceea trebuie recalibrate lucrurile in relatia cu pnl

8136017 she did a great job i think she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election she was outstanding
8136018 the law recognises a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8136019 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8136020 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8136021 i think that its something that at times the media tried to make more of
8136022 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups
8136023 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8136024 they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8136025 police will seek the warrants for our arrest today dont panic if we have been arrested others will carry on
8136026 if you want to arrest us come here and arrest us here it is the government who must go
8136027 the pads highly provocative action yesterday was completely uncalled for
8136028 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8136029 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8136030 since commencing in 1998 he has grown enormously in terms of his leadership and the contribution he has made to the culture of our playing group especially in recent years has been very significant
8136031 well always remember the animated bass responses the selfless acts of courage and the long runs out of defence which were trademarks of his 11 years as a player
8136032 martin dwaine johnson told authorities that an associate and an accomplice were planning to kill sen barack obama using a sniper rifle simply because he is black but the threat was not deemed credible by federal authorities
8136033 colorados u s attorney troy eid said today the threats did not meet the legal standard to charge the men with making a threat against obama
8136034 there is a difference between a true threat and the reported racist rantings of drug abusers eid said during a press conference
8136035 but eid did announce his office had filed federal gun and drug charges against tharin gartrell shawn adolf and johnson
8136036 human rights in general is a big thing with us
8136037 it turns out the obama campaign and all the pundits had nothing to worry about
8136038 youve got to go out there and gut and skewer mccain
8136039 a lot of democrats are going to vote for mccain
8136040 i was with a lot of the clinton staff this afternoon and i think this is being built up to be much more than it really is
8136041 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8136042 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on
8136043 nwa people told me well you know this is something the computer generates
8136044 some airlines do a very good job of matching to the watch lists and the cleared lists and some do not
8136045 we also send what is called a cleared list those would be individuals who might have a similar name but we have verified their identity and know those people are indeed not on a watch list
8136046 we dont put senators or reporters or others who are critical of the government on watch lists there are not millions of people on watch lists
8136047 we as an industry have to do a better job working with the tsa on the language we use when we have identified somebody who has a name that matches someone on the list
8136048 the bottom line is the whole idea of putting this list together was government initiated
8136049 and i believe we have a responsibility to fix it
8136050 i dont like this characters name linus it doesnt really fit his personality
8136051 lets go for a walk lets get some ice cream
8136052 im a racist thats why im not voting for obama
8136053 im not excited about him people arent excited about senator mccain
8136054 ive talked to middle class people that arent going to go to the polls vote for anybody period these are independents that normally vote republican in this county
8136055 if senator mccain came to voice of america i dont think there would be 5 000 people
8136056 the moscow international circus is an international circus that started out in moscow russia battle with republican guard nears as troops continue to advance on baghdad
8136057 i am writing to you to urge you to oppose an exemption for india from the rules of the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group nsg
8136058 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
8136059 the us india nuclear agreement effectively grants india the privileges of nuclear weapons states nws despite the fact that india developed nuclear weapons outside the nunclear non proliferation treaty npt regime the agreement doesnt even require india to accept the same responsibilities as other states i e full scope iaea safeguards for non nws and a commitment from nws to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of nuclear weapons
8136060 it continues to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons and retains the option to test nuclear weapons again in the future under these circumstances an exemption for india offers no benefits it will only serve to set back efforts for nuclear disarmament and undermine the international non proliferation regime
8136061 its used in other sports so i dont know why baseball was opposed to it yes weve dealt with the human element for a long time in baseball but there have been a lot of bad calls over the years that im sure the umpires didnt go home and sleep well after seeing it on replay ive lost a couple of home runs over the years that were called foul but i just think its always right to make the right call for all parties
8136062 im an old school guy and i still feel that its the umpires call to make whether its the right one or the wrong one the human element is what makes baseball so great and so much fun because with the naked eye you can either make it right or make it wrong
8136063 its a story thats still evolving and its very complicated so going in with a drug like varenicline im not surprised that there are side effects
8136064 its been shown to increase the release of dopa mine glutamate gaba every major neurotransmitter
8136065 i was hopeful that varenicline could be used for schizophrenia
8136066 then the first report came out of it causing a psychotic episode and it was hands off
8136067 it was great to be honored by this event the speeches were interesting and it was good to see everyone again to talk about the past
8136068 it gave us young fellows a job and a place to sleep at night
8136069 the whole thing was run under the army and we had a commanding officer directing us to plant trees build camps and etc
8136070 our parents received 25 a month and we got 5 allowance but back then it was 10 cents to see a movie
8136071 i offered to trade her a fattening hog for those girls
8136072 i meant it as a joke ive said it a million times most people get a kick out of it
8136073 i join the people of guam in mourning the deaths of sgt brian leon guerrero and spc samson mora who were fatally injured in afghanistan
8136074 as the dawn of the next day approached those of us who remained in the trenches became very anxious for our own safety and when the dawn appeared there were several regiments still on duty at this time a very dense fog began to rise off the river and it seemed to settle in a peculiar manner over both encampments i recollect this peculiar providential occurrence perfectly well and so very dense was the atmosphere that i could scarcely discern a man at six yards distance we tarried until the sun had risen but the fog remained as dense as ever
8136075 may the god of the armies of israel shower down the blessings of his divine providence in the day of battle and danger

8136096 og n r det er sagt s kan jeg godt afsl re at vi afsluttede regnskabs ret 2007 08 30 juni og at vores resultat ikke har v ret bedre de sidste fem seks r
8136097 i flip a coin to decide on which building to destroy but in the end i destroy them both
8136098 snake in my ass literally right now theres a snake in my ass
8136099 sin importar si votaron por m o por barack este es el momento de unirse como un solo partido con un nico prop sito
8136100 no a mccain barack obama es mi candidato y l debe ser nuestro presidente
8136101 cuando barack obama est en la casa blanca l revitalizar nuestra econom a defender a la gente trabajadora de estados unidos y enfrentar los desaf os mundiales de nuestro tiempo
8136102 hes an american hero hes got character hes been around
8136103 who started this rumor that he was a war hero where does that come from aside from himself about his suffering in the prison war camp
8136104 his 96 year old mother could beat the crap out of gore vidal with her shoe
8136105 nicollette sheridan y michael bolton pusieron fin a su compromiso amistosamente ambos aprecian que se respete su intimidad en este tema
8136106 il segreto del canto risiede tra la vibrazione della voce di chi canta ed il battito del cuore di chi ascolta
8136107 you know i was going to go with mitt romney but then i read rick lowrys post on the corner and i decide you know that huckabee sounds pretty good
8136108 oh youre a woman youre going to vote for the woman
8136109 by the way care8free what are you baylesss agent give it up if he were that g
8136110 these incidents are most unfortunate the police are looking into the matter and action will be taken against those who have caused these incidents
8136111 all of the above but we dont understand how it all fits together
8136112 the new gi bill is really not going to help me unless i go to grad school but its really important to see how it will help the military
8136113 in my opinion we need to focus on afghanistan and have it be a responsible redeployment from iraq
8136114 if you look at iraq the average casualty age is 21 this election really will affect us significantly
8136115 i had never worked with girls before theres cool clothes nobodys trying to kill me girls smell nice
8136116 had there not been a surge i probably wouldnt be alive today
8136117 nwa people told me well you know this is something the computer generates
8136118 some airlines do a very good job of matching to the watch lists and the cleared lists and some do not
8136119 we also send what is called a cleared list those would be individuals who might have a similar name but we have verified their identity and know those people are indeed not on a watch list
8136120 we dont put senators or reporters or others who are critical of the government on watch lists there are not millions of people on watch lists
8136121 we as an industry have to do a better job working with the tsa on the language we use when we have identified somebody who has a name that matches someone on the list
8136122 the bottom line is the whole idea of putting this list together was government initiated
8136123 and i believe we have a responsibility to fix it
8136124 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st
8136125 bring it i still help elect the popes around here last time i checked
8136126 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
8136127 like jfk obama is charismatic and represents a generational changing of the guard
8136128 like kennedy obama is a barrier breaking once in a generation leader
8136129 i believe that he has captured the imagination of a new generation as john f kennedy did
8136130 both are creatures of the mass media and built campaigns based on generational politics
8136131 carter had a reform message too and had a hard time connecting with the middle class
8136132 depends on which o we get the o from the primary was jfk the o over the last month or so has been jimmy c which if it continues will make him more like al smith jackie robinson may have looked the other way when he was attacked but when the game was tied he would steal home with his spikes high and sharp obama needs to run his campaign based on the jackie robinson model project the hope brand but dont forget what it takes to win
8136133 jimmy carter so far if elected hopefully the comparison ends
8136134 both men are appealing charismatic and intelligent trailblazers but also cautious and sometimes overconfident
8136135 he is his own phenomenon but of this group colin is the closest
8136136 obamas similarities to 1992s bill clinton may be the source of their mutual discomfort bright self assured and clearly capable of winning the election and governing obama seeks nothing short of supplanting bill as a leader toward electoral success but a president we can be proud to follow
8136137 jackie robinson is the closest comparison obamas nomination is historical and if he wins his victory will be felt way beyond politics both home and abroad
8136138 he is a unique character in american politics a first
8136139 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8136140 were not in the business of trying were in the business of doing
8136141 its not the way we wanted to start this series
8136142 their senses are so much different when you play the red sox
8136143 they know how to relax in the tough situations theyve been through it a lot you know theyre not going to panic which is encouraging you dont necessarily like being in this position but because youve been through it before people understand what it takes
8136144 were not in the business of trying were in the business of doing

8136147 from what i understand michael is somewhere on a lawn chair with a pizza
8136148 hes retired and i expect him to stay that way
8136149 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8136150 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8136151 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8136152 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8136153 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8136154 i dont really know if i would come back because somebody else got hurt
8136155 you come back because you want to come back and play mike knows the grind that you go through playing a 16 week season so i think michael is going to make the best decision for michael strahan
8136156 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8136157 ive got a great home at fox now and i think its where i belong i wish i couldve had different news for giants fans but ive known for a while im done

8136169 she did a great job i think she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election she was outstanding
8136170 she did a great job i think she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election she was outstanding
8136171 we are working with fema to get to the bottom of it
8136172 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
8136173 ainda sim existe uma tend ncia de redu o da taxa de inadimpl ncia

8136178 i wanted to make a blog on vocations one where everybody could bring their own experiences
8136179 i wanted to create a showcase for the pastoral experience of nuns
8136180 instead they made it look like it was a catwalk a la miss italy
8136181 some of my friends think its funny but mostly they are supportive
8136182 i know its not very feminine but i think it will become more acceptable once more and more women qualify
8136183 im proud to be related to such a great man
8136184 ive spoken to boxing trainer brian hughes who also wrote a book about jock and he says that todays boxers arent fit to lace his boots
8136185 with the expectation that one two or several individuals would drop by to share what a meal to get through to the next day
8136186 giving to others is a way of becoming an angel on earth granny said and i came to believe it
8136187 hey im going to dublin maybe ill run into your bff bono
8136188 the more people let these kids get away with it the more they will do it these kids need to have respect there is a lack of it in this country these days communities need to stand up for themselves the more people that do then the more these children will realise that they cannot get away with their actions
8136189 i was sat on the computer and saw him out of the corner of my eye
8136190 he was flicking his chips with his fork on to the pavement outside the gate
8136191 i was telling him to shift through the window i then went to the front door and told him to go away
8136192 they were making threats and said they would be back then they disappeared
8136193 i went outside and the next thing i knew one of them went behind my back and hit me on the head with something i thought it was a bottle at first
8136194 these children could be carrying anything these days but if you stopped and thought about it they would ride roughshod over everyone they thought that they could do want they wanted whenever they wanted
8136195 their actions will not be tolerated i am sure there are people who could assist us in our inquiries and i would appeal to them to get in touch
8136196 were hopefully getting the keys to our first home together in the next few weeks
8136197 before the apprentice no one knows who you are but since the show people are always coming up to say hello or to pinch my bum
8136198 and i was just walking down the street today when a bloke came up and kissed me everyone has been so nice to me since the show
8136199 hannah has been brilliant about it all i think shes coped better than me
8136200 its cool i love meeting new people and im always the first to offer to take a photo when people run up to alex
8136201 next week im doing a photo shoot for my first calendar
8136202 it turns out the obama campaign and all the pundits had nothing to worry about
8136203 youve got to go out there and gut and skewer mccain
8136204 a lot of democrats are going to vote for mccain
8136205 i was with a lot of the clinton staff this afternoon and i think this is being built up to be much more than it really is
8136206 barack obama es mi candidato y debe ser nuestro presidente
8136207 no tenemos un momento que perder ni ning n voto de sobra
8136208 estoy aqu esta noche como madre orgullosa como dem crata orgullosa como senadora orgullosa de nueva york como orgullosa estadounidense y como orgullosa simpatizante de barack obama
8136209 recuperar el pa s que amamos y no importa si ustedes votaron por m o por barack este es el momento de unirnos como un solo partido y con un solo prop sito
8136210 estamos en el mismo equipo y ninguno de nosotros puede darse el lujo de sentarse a un lado
8136211 esta es una lucha por el futuro y una batalla que debemos ganar juntos
8136212 no queremos cuatro a os m s de los ocho que ya tuvimos
8136213 ustedes me ense aron mucho me hicieron re r e incluso me hicieron llorar
8136214 me permitieron ser parte de sus vidas y ustedes de la m a
8136215 revitalizar nuestra econom a defender a la clase trabajadora y enfrentar los retos globales de nuestro tiempo
8136216 recuerdo que ya lo hicimos antes con el presidente clinton y los dem cratas
8136217 ya lo hicimos y lo haremos otra vez con el presidente obama
8136218 alguien con muy poca experiencia nacional o internacional que empez a buscar la presidencia desde el primer d a lleg al senado
8136219 empez su campa a presidencial dejando en claro que barack obama no estaba preparado para gobernar
8136220 conservo la rapidez y puedo golpear como siempre pero ya no es lo mismo que 10 a os atr s me levanto a entrenarme todos los d as a las cinco de la ma ana y me duele la espalda y las rodillas lo cual indica que est cerca el retiro
8136221 me gustar a que fuera el filipino manny pacquiao porque le ha ganado a varios mexicanos en los ltimos tiempos y quiero vengarlos
8136222 todav a me fajo en el gimnasio como cualquiera pero cada vez todo se pone m s peligroso porque los rivales son j venes no creo en que el retiro sea despu s de la pr xima pelea pero puede ser
8136223 es mejor como era antes que unos jueces vean y luego decidan el ganador porque ahora los boxeadores tiran golpes a lo loco y eso perjudica especialmente a los latinos
8136224 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8136225 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8136226 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8136227 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8136228 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8136229 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8136230 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
8136231 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
8136232 existen varias normas relacionadas al trato entre pacientes y profesionales de la salud pero la m s espec fica en materia de asistencia en el momento del parto es la ley nacional n mero 25
8136233 en este sentido dos de sus art culos son los m s representativos
8136234 al poseer car cter nacional opera por encima de cualquier norma interna de las instituciones o centros de salud e inclusive de cualquier ley provincial y argument que si una instituci n colabora en la prohibici n del acceso del familiar deber ser sancionada al igual que el m dico quien con su actitud adem s estar a violando el decreto 8
8136235 el profesional que ha de examinar a una mujer debe procurar hacerlo en presencia de uno de sus familiares o en su defecto del personal auxiliar
8136236 es obligaci n del profesional conocer y comunicar cuales son los derechos de sus pacientes lo conveniente ser a propiciar un di logo previo entre ambos para que los pacientes elijan libremente a su m dico
8136237 la presencia de un familiar en el nacimiento de un ni o es muchas veces necesaria el nacimiento de un beb es un acontecimiento familiar de hecho siempre se hac an los partos a nivel domiciliario donde estaban los abuelos los hermanos u otros familiares presentes debe haber esa contenci n familiar para la embarazada
8136238 el estado se deber a haber encargado de difundir esto
8136239 creo que este tema tiene que ver con un acuerdo entre el m dico y el paciente muchas instituciones no permiten el ingreso de los familiares en los partos
8136240 es importante que el padre o el familiar est con ropa adecuada y preparado mentalmente para el momento del parto porque sino se transforma en un impedimento para algunas maniobras que los m dicos tenemos que realizar
8136241 cuando tuve mi bebe no permitieron pasar a mi marido el m dico me explic que estaba prohibido presenciar un parto por ces rea
8136242 mi parto fue natural y en el momento entr un familiar m o a quien no le hicieron ning n problema e inclusive no hizo falta preparaci n alguna por parte del mismo
8136243 en mis dos partos mi marido me ha acompa ado en la cl nica nunca le manifestaron ning n problema para ingresar a la sala inclusive es la misma instituci n la que preparara los zambos gorros u otros materiales descartables para ese momento
8136244 no se me pas por la cabeza asistir al parto de mi esposa no tenia curiosidad quer a ver bien a mi hijo y nada mas mi mujer tampoco me pidi que estuviese en ese momento pero en la cl nica me hicieron saber que s pod a entrar
8136245 i just wondered how it would feel to shoot grandma
8136246 one side of me says id like to talk to her date her the other side of me says i wonder how her head would look on a stick
8136247 i have learned over the last three days theres a very fine line between bullheaded and dedicated at first we were dedicated and then you turn just plain bullheaded about it we were going to keep this going for the community
8136248 we will definitely be coming back here to set up a meeting with authorities
8136249 regardless of how long it has been theyre all seeking some sort of closure
8136250 weve met a lot of really good people on the tour so far
8136251 its a big family but its not a family you really want to be a part of
8136252 we do whatever we can do to generate publicity then help law enforcement in whatever way we can
8136253 families who have been waiting so long for answers like this one deserve to have their case given more attention
8136254 anytime you can do something to draw attention to an old case it cant hurt
8136255 theres almost always someone who knows something about an unsolved case maybe theyve been afraid to talk about it for whatever reason or didnt think what they know is important sometimes it can be the smallest thing that can help solve a case like this
8136256 if these bats perform at the level of standards they purport to absolutely
8136257 im very interested to see if this technology works and makes the game safer
8136258 the grain radiates from the center so you create a bat as strong as can be in any orientation
8136259 no grain goes all the way through the bat the most you can do is break one or two wedges the bat will not be catastrophically breaking
8136260 in the field you rely on your reactions and youre trained from your experience if what happens is completely different then youre in danger that will never happen with this bat
8136261 the biggest challenge he probably has is to convince retailers to stock the bat
8136262 its one thing to make a great bat its another to get the retailers excited about it
8136263 hed have to go to spring training and start handing some of them out and let guys use them when theyre just getting back into it
8136264 a lot of guys are pretty set in their ways with their wood
8136265 it feels like a metal bat because its very well balanced it felt better than a normal wood bat it almost feels like a composite wood bat
8136266 you love to have your favorite bats last so durability could be a factor
8136267 if these bats perform at the level of standards they purport to absolutely
8136268 im very interested to see if this technology works and makes the game safer
8136269 the grain radiates from the center so you create a bat as strong as can be in any orientation

8136278 i feel that prayer is more important than great voices
8136279 i sent word to the pastor letting him know what was happening
8136280 songwriters always have their ears open to a song the song started singing to me i wanted to write it down but couldnt i thought the song would be gone after the service following the dismissal i went home the next morning to my surprise i heard the song again so i went to the piano and began to put it all down
8136281 when you hear the dogs barking move on when you see the torches keep moving we must move on
8136282 the negatives lately have outweighed our positives but i still see the light at the end i cant stop walking towards it and i wont ill always be here for you ive told you this countless times im not walking out on us i wont give up i need you to help facilitate our future together i cant do it alone i truly believe that if we make it to d c together then we can be a happy family this is what i want ive betrayed you once im never going to do it again i used to say id never cheat on anyone but i did you cant really say youd never do anything until youve done it and i know deep down id never do that again im sorry for the things ive done to hurt you and the things i havent done to show you how much i really care we both need to change for one another in order for this to work we both need to accept that compromises must be made and not one person is in control we need to have faith in one another and always believe that this is going to work we shrouded in negativity doubt and mistrust and its blinding us from our wonderful future so im pledging to devote myself one hundred percent to you and us and our future for as long as you want one too if you dont want my love just say the words but you are who i want you are the person i believe in i know we are right for each other and that we can be genuinely happy forever but we need to try and also change for one another now we are both young and inexperienced in this and mistakes will be made along the way but we need to believe in one another during these times instead of making accusations and jumping to conclusions so what im trying to say is that i love you for who you are now and will only love you more as you become the person girlfriend mother wife friend that you can be and will be love boy

8136301 there should be something special in my collection at that time olympic games were going on and it came in my mind if any metal coin has been issued in the olympics i came to know that the first olympics coin was issued in 1952 from helinski which was host country for the games from my sources i got the coin after that i have been trying to collect more coins
8136302 unfortunately i am unable to get beijing coins till date i got few coins but i am trying for more coins i feel very soon i would get them

8136570 ive had extenuating family circumstances to deal with this year that has not been ideal and i have four kids that need a father it was a tough decision to walk away as coach but an easy one in a way because i knew what i had to do and had to make my kids my priority
8136571 to be a full time coach you have to dedicate your life to the trade and the hours are incredible in my situation i just no longer have that time to give and had to make the decision for my kids it was a situation where something had to give and unfortunately its the coaching
8136572 its fair to say when i came in the club was disjointed there had been no continuity in the retention of the core group of players and weve made sure we have given the responsibility to our key players to know how important they are to us
8136573 the task has been to find players willing to do the work to be successful and that have the ability to play the game in the current form that it is in our major focus has been on building and promoting local talent and those kids have been given opportunities and should be better for the experience
8136574 ive been proud of the shift in culture ive seen take place at the club there is a real hard work ethic from everyone to the staff to the players and it has been good to see the players are now working desperately hard to bring back the pride to the club

8136596 to play them such a trick when they have swallowed all our bull and rallied round so quick
8136597 youre now under the gun is everybody fine with that

8136603 we think that resveratrol is a good agent that may be able to prevent the start of breast cancer
8136604 there are a couple of problems with getting resveratrol from red wine
8136605 im really excited for this season we have the potential to be one of the best teams maybe even the best team ever at nebraska
8136606 we have a good balance of returning and incoming players that will contribute right away
8136607 they have the new learning curve of coming into college to get used to but theyll be in the mix right away
8136608 last year we were all really close but with the girls coming in the chemistry will be the same after awhile
8136609 itll be a good year i want to play solid throughout the year and just help the team out as much as possible
8136610 we want great results so we should expect to be the best in the field
8136611 well use a little more psychology this year for a different mentality in order to play at a higher level
8136612 i sit down with students and talk to them about what they want to do
8136613 i came back to school when i was 31 years old and havent left since
8136614 our student body is making a difference in the community
8136615 if i wasnt in the frat i dont know if i wouldve been involved in something like that
8136616 i think that nebraskans as a people are very concerned about our neighbors
8136617 we see a need and we want to help fill the void
8136618 considering how expensive college is the iphone wouldnt be enough to change my mind
8136619 i dont think that those are the kinds of things that we would be looking at doing
8136620 i want that excitement and enthusiasm to come forward from the students naturally and not come from a free iphone
8136621 it wouldnt affect my decision its not going to make or break my university experience
8136622 we often hear from prospective students that they are impressed with how personal our admissions process is
8136623 i like nebraska a lot better and it has a lot to offer its exciting to have this opportunity
8136624 it was tough but ultimately it benefited me to be back closer to home and to be a little happier
8136625 coach spangler offered a scholarship to me first thing after i contacted him
8136626 ill be the first to admit i didnt recruit him hard enough or thorough enough
8136627 hindsight is 20 20 he ended up a husker now and im glad to have him
8136628 i like to go out to my course and play at night

8136630 hes played on a big stage many times in the last couple years hes played golf on a national stage this summer a golf course is a golf course whether you are playing big 12 or pac 10 or whatever
8136631 erik brings a tremendous amount of competitive experience with him
8136632 hes somebody who wouldnt have accomplished what he did as a player if he wasnt competitive and really driven and he brings those qualities to our gym and to our staff thats why i wanted to hire him
8136633 just because youre a great player or you have great playing experience doesnt make you a great coach
8136634 but it definitely provides you with some insight and background into the game a little bit
8136635 its the sudden stop when you hit the ground that hurts like crazy

8136661 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8136662 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward

8136682 the truth is out there in search of intelligent life in the world of 9 11 conspiracy theories

8136696 those nerves are going away theyre becoming more confident with the game plan but those nerves are going away
8136697 you would think we were scrimmaging the way we were playing
8136698 were getting a little tired of playing each other and all that good stuff
8136699 just because youre my squid doesnt mean youre my ally
8136700 we have some more days of practice and well get them ready we have a lot more learning to do and we need to familiarize ourselves more with the process
8136701 were ready for a game in the sense that were just anxious to play someone else
8136702 i feel our offense is game ready we know theres going to be mistakes but i think were ready to play that game with us knowing the assignments and were ready mentally
8136703 it was very frustrating to see that and im sure it was frustrating for fans i just want us to play hard no matter the situation we just need to get after it
8136704 i dont want to let anyone down i know the excitement is there and theres no one more excited than me i cant let that affect me and i have to look at the reality and see what i can do to get this football team ready

8136731 it was nice to have berkman up there and to get him because he has beaten me so many damn times
8136732 in this park im up 3 1 and he hits a three run jack or something
8136733 to hold this team to one run in this park thats masterful
8136734 even if you have an off year you usually sprinkle in a few here and there i knew after last time when i went seven and he pulled me we thought we might not ever get this thing now we got one so were off the schneid for this season
8136735 a lot of good defensive plays that wont show up in the box score
8136736 he rang me up on balls i thought were really low
8136737 so i went to the mound and test him out he called those strikes too so i said beautiful and tried to stay way way low with my pitches down at the bottom of the zone right at the knees and those got me all those ground balls

8136757 hes taken care of things and will be able to play but i wish he would have been eligible for the first practice aug 4 when the rest of the 104 athletes were
8136758 for coaches players and fans alike the carolina game is going to be as close to a regular season game as can be in the preseason
8136759 its hard to prepare yourself when you know youre only going to play one quarter
8136760 you know we didnt gameplan the jets at least as far as the players go we practiced against our defense all week and we didnt practice against the 3 4 look offensively i know our defense didnt prepare very much for them like i said you know youre only going to play a quarter you know when a quarter ends youre going out so its hard to get in a mental state to get fired up to play hard
8136761 i think our biggest goal is to just do what we want to do and to have a great drive
8136762 we did put one nice drive together and move it down the field we had a penalty there that moved us back in the redzone and we didnt score a touchdown but i think we felt confident that we put a good drive together with our first team
8136763 it was exciting i was happy that we could have such a successful two minutes and its fun to see colt brennan throw the ball
8136764 even the guys on the sidelines are excited to watch colt pass i was surprised that they didnt just go for the touchdown i was surprised that they went in to tie it up in a preseason game its different that they went for the overtime shot i thought that they could get two plays at the endzone but thats them we had a good time though it was exciting and we had everyone up on their feet
8136765 colt said to me on the sideline as soon as i go in im going for it he wants to throw the ball down field hell make smart plays but he also wants to throw the ball down field i think its good for a young quarterback to have that confidence
8136766 bids may be accepted if acceptance is in the best interest of the state
8136767 hes different certainly than any of the young guys ive seen as far as how far ahead mentally he is in the scheme of things
8136768 i cant wait to watch him play i think he has a tremendous feel for the game its nice
8136769 hes one of those guys who gets the ball out in a hurry
8136770 he can feel that rush and the ball comes out when hes being rushed he uses his backs and his check downs really well hes got a little bit of brett favre in him when hes trying to fire something and youre like whoa where did that come from brett favre will get those in there and he will too
8136771 the defense is going to be the face of the team and rightfully so
8136772 i got to be honest ive been thinking about recruiting jamaica since i saw that stuff
8136773 ive been to jamaica and let me tell you something heres the extent that ive thought about that subject theres approximately 2 8 million people in jamaica which is approximately the size of the state of iowa or kansas or the city of houston

8136777 in the meantime the matter is still the subject of public discussion at the board
8136778 can this guy go into the backfield as a tight end give us some snaps there and play on special teams or is he just going to be a tight end that cant contribute on special teams when i have this fullback who can
8136779 i think its just someone who doesnt understand football very well
8136780 its like whats not a system quarterback some guy that doesnt have plays that just drops back and says everybody go deep and throws it
8136781 someone said the guy should have done his homework and gotten the new license well guess who gets to decide if he gets a license or not denny sadowski think he is going to vote to give hime a licsense not until he shows he has four years experience installing field turf in a supervisory position working for another licesned filed turf installer been doing it under a c 27 licsne sorry no good go get a job and apply again in four years guess what there is only four companies that have the licsen and they are not going to vote to allow new competitors the whole process is an inherent conflict of interest in the name of the protecting consumers from uscrupouls unqualfied contactors what they really do is protect themselves from competition

8136800 kejadian tersebut betul betul tidak masuk akal warga soviet berteriak dalam terror
8136801 kalkulasi mengindikasikan bahwa suhu mencapai 1 100 derajat celsius atau lebih dari 2 000 derajat fahrenheit
8136802 ini lebih yang dapat kita bayangkan hampir mirip neraka api brutal ada di pusat bumi
8136803 as a communist i dont believe in heaven or the bible but as a scientist i now believe in hell
8136804 needless to say we were shocked to make such a discovery but we know what we saw and we know what we heard and we are absolutely convinced that we drilled through the gates of hell
8136805 the drill suddenly began to rotate wildly indicating that we had reached a large empty pocket or cavern temperature sensors showed a dramatic increase in heat to 2 000 degrees fahrenheit
8136806 we lowered a microphone designed to detect the sounds of plate movements down the shaft but instead of plate movements we heard a human voice screaming in pain at first we thought the sound was coming from our own equipment
8136807 dave represented everything we valued about disruption and creative thinking
8136808 he brought a sensibility to the business that got people to look at the world a little differently
8136809 fine they may be as obsessed about their outward appearance as you but its way too late to cash in on their 15 minutes and way too early to try and make an ironic comeback statement
8136810 are you a minority agency or an agency that just happens to have minority talent
8136811 yeah i could go work at goldman sachs and make half a mil a year but id rather come work for you because youre black owned
8136812 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
8136813 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8136814 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8136815 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8136816 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8136817 i am a historian i am not a believer but i must confess as a historian that this penniless preacher from nazareth is irrevocably the very center of history jesus christ is easily the most dominant figure in all history
8136818 here i am i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in and eat with him and he with me

8136825 a feature is not a feature until some user used it
8136826 what they should do is remove two rows of seats in the right field stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in left field 12 feet
8136827 that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the wall 8 feet and end up in the first row
8136828 and they should raise the wall to the same height in center to eliminate home runs that barely clear the wall and land in the grass
8136829 they should put wind screens up in that gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and center
8136830 im not bitching about this because of my record 4 13 but i know that would save our pitchers 20 home runs a year and at least 30 runs
8136831 how many line drives barely clear that wall in right and how many balls barely clear the center field wall and drop into that grass i know ive given up a few
8136832 its ok with me as long as it doesnt take too long

8136839 they dont look at palestinian politics which includes what is aired on the radio taught in school and preached in the mosque all of which makes up public opinion
8136840 what people say in arabic is really what is important
8136841 abu mazen is in many ways relatively moderate but he is not moderate on the palestinian refugees right of return which is very close to his heart

8136953 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room

8137035 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8137036 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8137037 among the metal containing products 95 percent were sold by us websites and 75 percent claimed good manufacturing practices
8137038 current regulations governing the quality of herbal supplements made and sold in the us and india are inadequate
8137039 we recommend strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements manufacturers should have to demonstrate compliance with these standards through independent third party laboratory testing

8137041 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
8137042 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
8137043 this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again
8137044 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
8137045 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed
8137046 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
8137047 acquisition is getting the crime related digital information from a computer or network
8137048 it is the most important part because if you do something wrong in that process you cannot use it in court
8137049 this involves crimes such as hacking id theft and the dissemination of trojan horses or viruses
8137050 research into cyber forensics started with support to law enforcement agencies
8137051 they needed to work at crime scenes where digital evidence needed to be recovered
8137052 we supported the agencies with training in application of a crime scene methodology and the analysis of digital evidence acquired at the crime scene
8137053 if an investigator collects biological samples without using gloves he will contaminate it and it wont be accepted in court
8137054 similarly digital evidence needs to be collected using the correct process to enable acceptance in court
8137055 firstly digital evidence can be a technologically complex issue requiring expert witnesses and familiarity with the terminology in court
8137056 secondly there is the issue of acceptance digital evidence is a recent development that has not been fully tested in court
8137057 a feature of digital evidence is that it is difficult to prove that the evidence is original unmodified evidence
8137058 this requires a sound evidence gathering process because opposing counsel will try to prove that the acquisition process was faulty

8137067 la estrategia de putin y medv dev busca subrayar el contraste entre la respuesta rusa de 1991 y la de ahora primero para recordar que mosc ya intent la v a de la negociaci n segundo para demostrar que la ruptura del statu quo es responsabilidad de georgia y tercero y tal vez m s importante para dejar patente que la rusia de hoy no es la de entonces
8137068 no han conseguido reconducir la crisis ni arrebatar la iniciativa a mosc

8137077 plantea un desaf o suscita fuertes discrepancias entre los occidentales y obligar a revisar los planes de la otan
8137078 poco puede hacer occidente ante los hechos consumados ni siquiera arrogarse la superioridad moral cuando eeuu y la mayor parte de la ue hicieron exactamente lo mismo en kosovo
8137079 sin embargo es evidente que washington y bruselas est n obligados a reaccionar si no quieren que la historia se repita en cualquier otro lugar de la inmensa frontera rusa
8137080 el inquietante interrogante ahora es si su belicosa actitud se dar por satisfecha con el desconcierto causado o s lo constituye la evidencia inicial de un plan m s profundo para tratar de regresar a un mundo bipolar
8137081 el problema es que el resfriado es fuerte y que los remedios no se adivinan con efecto a corto y medio plazo

8137101 and we were unable do anything both from the mound and defensively to keep those runs from coming in
8137102 we unloaded on a lot of borderline and bad pitches tonight
8137103 a veteran pitcher will get you to do that and offensively youve got to be more disciplined we will eventually get there thats part of the experience
8137104 i threw the ball without really seeing the base things happen if i make that play maybe were still playing
8137105 that guy started saying all kinds of stuff why didnt i make it to second hey i hit the ball hard people who know baseball know the guy marlon byrd made a nice play i had no chance to make it to second
8137106 i can deal with that but the next at bat when i hit the ball to left field he said the magic words something personal about my family i dont deal well with that thats enough right there
8137107 i understand who i am and the money that im making
8137108 i understand that im hitting 250 and the fans are expecting a lot more than theyre seeing but the word he said trust me anybody would want to go there and kick his backside
8137109 i talked with the doctor tuesday and he said i can do some running right now and some light swinging in the next couple of days hopefully by the time i come off the dl disabled list i could be close im not saying its going to be that day but by sept 10 i will be good to go
8137110 i was getting adjusted and comfortable and this kind of puts a little wrinkle in it
8137111 hes played as good as anybody and maybe better than anybody we put in center field
8137112 i will try to help the team win and other than that trying to finish up on a good note
8137113 hopefully it will be solid enough for us in production and keeping guys healthy and sucking up some innings out of the rotation
8137114 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8137115 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8137116 it started in the loungeroom on one side of the house and it just took the rest of it within two minutes
8137117 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8137118 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8137119 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8137120 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8137121 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8137122 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
8137123 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
8137124 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8137125 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8137126 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
8137127 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8137128 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
8137129 the first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit the second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are

8137139 choice is concerned about the level of access that pharmaceutical company drug representatives have to gps relative to independent sources of information

8137148 as a member of the opposition alliance pakatan rakyat we will agree to support anwar as opposition leader to replace his wife
8137149 i am not sure that pas is convinced that he can get 30 government mps to cross over
8137150 he may not have the credibility needed to keep the country together
8137151 i think the main contents of his anwars policies are sound and they do make sense economically over the long run because it should have a positive impact on malaysias competitiveness
8137152 but i do question his ability to deliver them when and if he does become prime minister given that the opposition coalition that he leads is comprised of three parties with widely differing agendas and ideologies
8137153 weve established five victims from our initial inquiries and subsequent to that weve had a further eight people come forward
8137154 were looking at 13 victims who are cooperating with the police at this stage
8137155 one of them was a former teacher at the school and the other person worked in other capacities at the school
8137156 it was not our understanding that they were just going to give the job to jay we in no way thought that we knew he would have to win the job
8137157 while no one promised him the job we were under the impression he would be given a better opportunity to win it
8137158 had we known he wasnt even going to get that chance we never would have signed with the chiefs
8137159 it was just an ok day and i guess thats what they based their decision on they felt the other guys kicked better in the two days we appreciate the chiefs bringing him in and letting him kick he will kick somewhere in the league this year and kick well
8137160 this is what they want they know thats what they gettin they ask me what i do i tell em im teaching for a living

8137163 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
8137164 i say it with force by abandoning the afghan people to their bad luck and their tormentors by abandoning out democratic allies and our responsibilities as a permanent member of the united nations security council we would be in a way abandoning the security of the french people and our status as a great power
8137165 the combat that they are leading in afghanistan is a just combat a combat that we must not lose
8137166 for them the goal is to hit our spirits to cut our forces off from the support of public opinion to sow doubts in western public opinion so that certain countries leave
8137167 its not because you have extra drones or helicopters that youll avoid that talibans who are hidden in the mountains appear and decide to launch an operation

8137174 e ha gi rivelato uno dei suoi progetti pi ambiziosi la raccolta di tutti i teoremi matematici in ununica opera scritti tutti mediante la notazione della logica simbolica
8137175 fu il risultato di questo sforzo ciclopico e fu probabilmente lopera alla quale peano stesso teneva di pi ma questo non bast a trasformare il
8137176 che rest la sua ossessione per il resto della sua vita il pi grande progetto di peano rest infatti la fondazione di una lingua universale semplice da imparare e tale da non dare adito ad ambiguit gli
8137177 le domande riguardanti i fondamenti della matematica sebbene recentemente assai dibattute restano ancora senza riposte soddisfacenti lambiguit del linguaggio la causa principale dei problemi del filosofo per questo che della massima importanza esaminare attentamente tutte le parole che usiamo
8137178 does sex education encourage sex many parents are afraid that talking about sex with their teenagers will be taken as permission for the teen to have sex nothing could be further from the truth if anything the more children learn about sexuality from talking with their parents and teachers and reading accurate books the less they feel compelled to find out for themselves
8137179 parents arent sex education experts just because they are parents
8137180 experts agree that parents not school instructors are a childs best role models of sexuality they communicate with their children about sex and sexual values nonverbally however most adolescents report that they have never been given any advice about sex by either parent even though a majority of teenagers prefer their parents and counselors as sources of sex information while studies also indicate that both parents and their children believe that they should be talking about sexuality parents are extremely uncomfortable doing so
8137181 we rode that wave in radio really well he said
8137182 this year the august month was clearly impacted by the olympics we expected that
8137183 but over that national advertising is certainly softer tighter more cautious than it was 12 months ago

8137187 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8137188 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war but we of course dont want it
8137189 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners in the west
8137190 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision and the situation will be calm
8137191 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8137192 the black sea is just a small pool for their arms with the range of 2 500 kilometers
8137193 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8137194 it is the first attempt in europe since nazi germany and stalin of a big country to annex the territory of another country
8137195 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted to oppose it to the west
8137196 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
8137197 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
8137198 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
8137199 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
8137200 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
8137201 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8137202 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8137203 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8137204 the county was put in an awkward position because of the lawsuits but i really do think its just about over
8137205 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8137206 the bonds have ben set low enough so that we believe that most people will bond out in a relatively short time
8137207 there was no warning we werent coming at them they were coming at us
8137208 we must remain nonviolent we must have the high moral ground
8137209 theres a powerful police presence here the chill of 1968 is in the air of denver
8137210 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8137211 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8137212 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8137213 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
8137214 the bookies in the u k have been pretty poor performers recently paddy powers certainly held up better than they have
8137215 paddy power are the only listed retail growth story right now in the u k

8137219 there are very few historical buildings as old as the cook museum in the area these dresses each bring back a little life to the history of libertyville
8137220 like everything in the house it took a while to put the dresses together again
8137221 it took me about three or four years to put together each of the dresses that have been up on display since 2003
8137222 when i first saw the dress i thought oh my theres a hole in this dress i have to mend
8137223 then i discovered the small pocket was meant for a lay down which is a tiny flat glass bottle the owner of the dress would have filled with a type of perfume
8137224 many women would have worn their wedding dresses after their wedding day
8137225 back then some women would have only owned three nice dresses which they wore over and over again and couldnt wash
8137226 you go through it once and you think you see everything
8137227 theres so many little things you come upon you just cant imagine the history
8137228 the infiltrators in police uniform opened indiscriminate fire at several places
8137229 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8137230 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8137231 we are working with fema to get to the bottom of it
8137232 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
8137233 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
8137234 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8137235 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8137236 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8137237 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
8137238 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
8137239 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems

8137278 the point is that film critics were and still are examining a mass medium to which they will not in general make a practical contribution
8137279 the same has been true for the critics of radio and television and to some extent even the mass print genres of magazines newspapers and trade fiction cultural critics of media often assume that the audience including themselves will not have access to the means of production

8137319 scout groups church groups maybe well be able to take the chicago bandits through it
8137320 we want to make sure that buildings going to open
8137321 we thought a casually elegant format was a better venue for us to thank our supporters and announce the public campaign
8137322 weve ordered thousands and thousands of items and some of them arent in yet
8137323 we were able to capitalize on an unfortunate event and improve the building at the same time
8137324 in those days it was an all volunteer department with no paid professionals
8137325 i remember we used to sit in front of the radio and listen to what was going on just to make sure he was ok
8137326 even when we go away visiting relatives hed bring the radio with him just in case he was needed
8137327 when he leaves office he is going to leave us with something we have had corrupt governors before but at least this one is leaving us with something he did a lot for illinois children
8137328 i do think people want to have an idea of whos going to be their next leader especially with the mess thats going on in springfield
8137329 i will say this i do believe gov blagojevich if he runs again is going to have a primary opponent or two or 10
8137330 this is something im going to think about and when i make a decision you will know about it
8137331 i think he has done a very good job even though he has not gotten a lot of credit for it
8137332 weve got a good five weeks here for me to rehab and get a good sense of how im recovering and what it looks like said glavine
8137333 then i think we will all have a better idea
8137334 she had a vision for what the 50th anniversary should be and she brought all these people together to bring her ideas to fruition
8137335 i wasnt surprised she would receive this honor i was wondering why it took so long
8137336 we just have a lot of fun trying to do things to show the community what this village has become in the past 50 years how it started out what a great village it has become and what a great place it is to live
8137337 people can actually put a face to all the planning
8137338 i want them to learn the importance of being involved and contributing to the community you live in
8137339 municipal elections have notoriously low turnouts but those elected officials are the people who will affect your everyday life
8137340 i like trying to do things to make the community better
8137341 this is a way to help georgia make their web pages visible to the world

8137344 we encourage naperville residents to participate in the special census as it benefits all areas of the city especially those that have experienced growth since the last special census
8137345 it helps us to better know the citizenry of naperville in order to provide better services for them
8137346 the time is now its time for a fresh start
8137347 his story is our story your story my story its the american story
8137348 whether your story begins in a small greek village on the plains of kansas or the streets of chicago were all americans
8137349 we need a president who knows how to remove the obstacles that stand between parents and their dreams for their children
8137350 i had a few advantages but i lacked the most important one of all i wasnt barack obama
8137351 how this obamas campaign has become a litmus test for being black i dont understand it
8137352 i want to call on the clinton delegates here and everywhere to help us do that and if you have trouble making the argument i offer you two words supreme court
8137353 think about it there are so many many reasons that organized labor that women that minorities that ordinary everyday americans need to choose barack obama
8137354 the healing process is going to take a little longer than four days
8137355 we didnt do anything wrong we supported the candidate of our choice how is that wrong why is there a them against us mentality in this race ive never seen anything like this before
8137356 i said doubting thomases i said we dont need anymore doubting thomases we all have got to be together she misinterpreted what i said
8137357 cl sicos y no tan cl sicos emuladores para linux
8137358 congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech
8137359 we reiterate our request that the department of justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the american issues project and we further request that the department of justice investigate and prosecute howard sic simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits
8137360 this is not about not supporting the affected communities because we do
8137361 if its going to happen we need to extract the maximum benefit for citizens
8137362 we are very excited to bring the fourth annual harvest hustle to the village this year
8137363 this event gives us the opportunity to promote healthy activities for our residents while raising money to support important initiatives
8137364 i thought this was a community of inclusion not exclusion
8137365 im saving gas im getting exercise where is that wrong
8137366 and when did commuters become the worst people in the world
8137367 ive never heard a complaint about commuter parking on eighth i cant believe weve spent this much time on it
8137368 its three spots we have a parking garage we spent millions of dollars and staff hours to make it all perfect its there lets use it
8137369 i dont think im going to live long enough to find the answers to that
8137370 you keep saying were going to do the study and put it on the ballot
8137371 theres probably two to three years of work after the study to even get it on the ballot
8137372 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
8137373 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8137374 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
8137375 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
8137376 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
8137377 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
8137378 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
8137379 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
8137380 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
8137381 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
8137382 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
8137383 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
8137384 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
8137385 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
8137386 we also need to figure out where were going to get salt and how much it will cost
8137387 im going to ask the attorney general to look into this because i believe its a blatant attempt at price fixing
8137388 there are a lot of questions i have as a public official as to how the state handled this
8137389 the pipeline was empty in march of last year all year the mines have been running flat out
8137390 i cant tell you if theres going to be enough for everybody to have what theyve bid
8137391 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
8137392 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8137393 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
8137394 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
8137395 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
8137396 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
8137397 labor day weekend is traditionally one of the deadliest weekends of the year on illinois highways

8137408 im afraid that youre wrong my dear wands may be the most common symbol associated with fire these days and i suppose i can see that as you need a stick of wood to start a fire but there are those who feel swords are more to fires taste
8137409 though i think i can see swords as being a symbol for sort of all the elements really
8137410 many feel the same way really metal from the earth fire to heat it air to feed the fire water to quench the blade spirit as intention
8137411 though air is still sort of the odd one out
8137412 no leprechauns are forthcoming my sources thus far have proved particularly intractable or and this is most of them particularly lacking in the gold department

8137418 its a community park that supports social interaction between individuals who might not otherwise meet
8137419 we offered a proposal for traffic calming and child safety to which the developer has agreed
8137420 this would mean people turning off eola onto the new sheffer connection would come into old eola with a sign that says do not enter
8137421 but it still keeps open the ability for traffic in the local area to get around the neighborhood without blocking them off entirely
8137422 i think this is a good compromise and it tackles a lot of concern that were brought up along the way most of us have kids and or are married and know we must sometimes pick our battles
8137423 i think we have picked the right battle and it is now time to compromise
8137424 this is a document that saves country club village isolates eola and uses sheffer as your own personal cut through for anything westbound
8137425 we were not considered this is not what we wanted
8137426 your putting through a road for one bank and youre destroying an entire community
8137427 a real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out
8137428 a friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words
8137429 a friend is one who believes in you when you have ceased to believe in yourself
8137430 your friend is the man who knows all about you and still likes you
8137431 two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labour for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up
8137432 friends are the most important ingredient in this recipe of life
8137433 the better part of ones life consists of his friendships
8137434 the love of my life is the love between friends
8137435 to be depressed is to be lonely to have a friend is to be happy
8137436 the greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches but to reveal to him his own
8137437 friendship is a pretty full time occupation if you really are friendly with somebody you cant have too many friends because then youre just not really friends
8137438 truth and tears clear the way to a deep and lasting friendship
8137439 its the friends you can call up at 4am that matter
8137440 what is a friend a single soul in two bodies
8137441 without friends no one would choose to live though he had all other goods
8137442 the best way to keep your friends is not to give them away
8137443 the happiest moments my heart knows are those in which it is pouring forth its affections to a few esteemed characters
8137444 one can never speak enough of the virtues the dangers the power of shared laughter
8137445 i no doubt deserved my enemies but i dont believe i deserved my friends
8137446 life is partly what we make it and partly what is made by the friends whom we choose
8137447 the most i can do for my friend is simply to be his friend i have no wealth to bestow on him if he knows that i am happy in loving him he will want no other reward is not friendship divine in this
8137448 if all my friends were to jump off a bridge i wouldnt jump with them id be at the bottom to catch them
8137449 a good friend is hard to find hard to lose and impossible to forget
8137450 a true friend is someone you can trust with all your secrets
8137451 when the silences are no longer akward you know you are around friends
8137452 everyone hears what you say friends listen to what you say best friends listen to what you dont say
8137453 a person is only complete when she has a true friend to understand her to share all her passions and sorrows with and to stand by her throughout her life
8137454 how do you know youve found your best friend when you are ready to talk to them about anything even though they know everything about you already
8137455 friends are like pillars on your porch sometimes they hold you up and sometimes they lean on you
8137456 friendship is delicate as a glass once broken it can be fixed but there will always be cracks
8137457 when i needed you most when i needed a friend you let me down now like i let you down then
8137458 thinking really really hard about checking out the local stitch amp bitch

8137466 with the private hospital programs ending and the population of lake county growing in general the demand continues to increase
8137467 we generally have 100 to 200 people on our call in waiting list at any point in time
8137468 were still working on trying to interview all staff who are affected to look at what else is available in the rest of the health department
8137469 this will severely impair a moms ability to undergo treatment
8137470 we work with 100 women per year and half of them have kids that they bring into treatment with them
8137471 many of those individuals need short stays at the addiction treatment program
8137472 those services will just be less available to the court as they are less available to anybody else
8137473 we work one to two years ahead on grants this significant
8137474 this has affected a lot of our county partners and its also affected our colleagues in the city who provide similar services
8137475 we probably need to work on assessing who has what to assist our patient needs with any patient that were not able to serve we look at what is available in the rest of the community
8137476 im doing this to remind everyone that anyone can be an inmate
8137477 i want to raise the awareness for the need for reform in the illinois department of corrections

8137479 in 25 percent one in every four organizing efforts somebody gets fired for saying id like to be in a union
8137480 thats not the united states of america thats communist china were acting more and more like them
8137481 i submit to you that when george bush said i want to bring freedom to the iraqi people and took the military there in an unjust and uncalled for war he should have taken that same military into the workplaces in this country and brought freedom to the american worker
8137482 there is no one carrying a union card living in poverty in the united states of america
8137483 you want more freedom in america you want more democracy in america lets get the efca passed
8137484 i was elected by over 84 000 democrats in western kentucky to represent hillary clinton and if her name is on the ballot that is what i plan to do
8137485 hopefully she goes through the program graduates and then the charges will be dismissed
8137486 i am honored to have the historic opportunity to nominate sen barack obama to be the next president of the united states of america
8137487 this is denver this is the southwest and there is a significant hispanic population here and salazar resonates well with them

8137498 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
8137499 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
8137500 the debts of governments federal state and local corporations farmers home mortgages and consumer commercial and financial debts
8137501 the consistency of the pattern suggests that some imperative is at work something that requires debt to increase
8137502 then i read g r taylors 1950 book hamilton and the national debt which described the debate over alexander hamiltons plan to fund the new economy with borrowed money
8137503 the most revealing account was a speech by the first congressman from georgia james jackson on february 9 1790 in which he predicted that adoption of hamiltons funding plan would lead to the explosive growth of debt
8137504 loans created only the principal interest had to be paid out of principal so payment of interest reduced the money supply and slowed economic activity recovery could come only when new loans were taken out at least equal to interest paid
8137505 as long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest debt must grow by compound interest
8137506 we are buying more and more in the same amount of time witness the efforts of people to get rid of their excess through yard sales storage units and big trash pickup days and the massive size of what are euphemistically called landfills while two billion people in the world lack basics such as clean water food and shelter americans throw away their microwave ovens televisions computers refrigerators furniture and cars meanwhile acceleration is applauded as increasing productivity its like arguing that cancer is good because it grows
8137507 stop using percentage rates to calculate charges for the use of money
8137508 congress must supply the economy with a money base that is debt free and interest free
8137509 this is a crucial time things are happening we have got some key media people talking and writing about our kind of reforms the inertia is starting to yield things are starting to roll the worsening conditions in 2009 will give us a once in a lifetime chance to be heard above the propaganda
8137510 its totally false and im sure it will all come out that way
8137511 its a shame that we have a system in which someone can make these kinds of claims without any proof
8137512 they had information that an employee jan hoeft had been using a company credit card for unauthorized purchases
8137513 it is alleged she used the card for personal items
8137514 in 148 days george bush no longer will be president
8137515 in the north and northwest suburbs there are new people there are young people living out there the 60s and 70s are over those people who voted solidly republican have moved away or just simply are gone
8137516 they think all they have to say is im not a republican im for change
8137517 it worked two years ago but people are really taking a serious look at the candidates they want more than just the sound bite they want people who have experience and they want people who will make the right changes in policy
8137518 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8137519 proud supporter of barack obama she dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8137520 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8137521 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8137522 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8137523 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8137524 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8137525 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8137526 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8137527 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8137528 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8137529 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8137530 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8137531 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8137532 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8137533 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8137534 without our caring volunteers however none of this is possible
8137535 we need to do a better job taking care of our military
8137536 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8137537 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8137538 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8137539 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8137540 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8137541 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8137542 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8137543 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8137544 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8137545 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8137546 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8137547 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8137548 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8137549 president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8137550 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8137551 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8137552 the circus begins in the dark tom swirly takes the stage tattered lab coat trailing coaxing slow the music is foreboding and disorienting the lights start to flash and glow jeremy weirdos joins in and triggers samples from the three stooges then the powerful voice of tom swirlys electro acoustical wind instrument hammers out a driving beat he grabs a loop sings over it with layers of angelic and demonic voices this is the dancers cue they emerge from the corners slowly feeling for the rhythm getting more wired till they climb all over the stage more acts some noisy some beautiful some energetic the dancers adapt gain strength form arabesques the lights rise to a climax a strobe the audience goes wild

8137577 weve had community members come to us who went to school in u 46 mobiles and now their children and grandchildren are going through the same thing just how long is temporary
8137578 when they have a school that is under capacity why are we not giving the parents the choice their kids could be bused to a less crowded school

8137582 were going to keep our traditions intact and were going to make a new one challenging every student every day
8137583 there seems to be great deal of pride in having those events
8137584 theres a deliberateness about bringing adults together at the school to celebrate student achievement
8137585 whether its a student mastering a new skill or a teacher learning a new technique were going to do it with excellence
8137586 when it happened it was something that was seen as a tragedy and it kind of held people back where now people acknowledge it for what it was and use it as a steppingstone to move on
8137587 ill never forget but its not in the back of my mind anymore
8137588 libraries suffer from cramming too much stuff into too small of an area

8137615 we want to represent the type of professional we want to place
8137616 internally i think it helps our staff feel better about what they do
8137617 maybe training the employees to do a better job auditing their programs would be a better investment than buying vests and sportcoats

8137629 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
8137630 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
8137631 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position

8137646 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8137647 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8137648 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8137649 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8137650 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8137651 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8137652 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8137653 the experience was overwhelmingly positive i hope to have the opportunity to attend a future nij conference
8137654 i was shy quiet and not comfortable speaking in front of groups
8137655 the skills i learned in toastmasters helped me not only prepare my presentation for the nij conference but also deliver well timed humor to keep the audience engaged
8137656 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8137657 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8137658 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8137659 im very excited and very happy it came out like this
8137660 for a little while everyone was worried he might get away with this
8137661 do you expect someone on the church choir to be friends with this guy beltran we didnt pick our witnesses the defendant did you may not like zuno but he came in here and told you what he saw
8137662 thats what youve been elected for you figure it out
8137663 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
8137664 listen i want you guys to look after the girls look after mommy before i get there and ill see you guys on thursday all right
8137665 she was unbelievable but im not surprised when she does something she does it well
8137666 she told her story its a story that a lot of families can relate to her dad struggled worked hard and here his daughter is addressing the nation
8137667 gives to ambitious corrupted or deluded citizens who devote themselves to the favorite nation facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium sometimes even with popularity gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation a commendable deference for public opinion or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliances of ambition corruption or infatuation
8137668 whats left of the ussr is a collapsed group of half failed states while the u s stands alone as the globes sole hyperpower
8137669 its birthday present appears to be another 100 million in budget cuts according to a defense department document
8137670 both intellectually and financially a fabulous and alluring gravy train
8137671 a fertile area to further the science of death and destruction
8137672 darpa has been creating insect databases while increasing efforts to understand how to use endemic insects as collectors of environmental information
8137673 how long until they start thinking about weaponizing insects as well
8137674 that such creatures could be weaponized and the possibility according to one scientist intimately familiar with the project that these cyborg insects might be armed with bio weapons
8137675 a lead in applying state of the art technology for military capabilities and to prevent technological surprise from her adversaries
8137676 has been behind some of the worlds most revolutionary inventions
8137677 the internet the global positioning system stealth technology and the computer mouse
8137678 darpa has funded things that a lot of people thought were ridiculous and some that people thought were impossible they make things happen
8137679 the us is the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels
8137680 enable submarines to engage elusive maneuvering land and sea targets
8137681 harness the insights and power of biology to make u s warfighters and their equipment more effective
8137682 understand how to use endemic insects as collectors of environmental information
8137683 this endemic insect system in key operational demonstrations here and abroad
8137684 we think we can use this concept to make smart weapons smarter
8137685 plan that reduces to an absolute minimum if not eliminates noncombatant casualties
8137686 help researchers in various disciplines self assemble into teams capable of developing plant inspired actuation systems that will ultimately have application in military adaptive or morphing structures
8137687 darpa supported researchers are studying how geckos climb walls and how an octopus hides to find new approaches to locomotion and highly adaptive camouflage the idea is to let nature be a guide toward better engineering
8137688 performance of rats birds and insects in performing missions of interest to dod such as exploration of caves or covert deposition of sensors
8137689 exploit the life sciences to make the individual warfighter stronger more alert more endurant and better able to heal
8137690 investigating ways to prevent fatigue and enable soldiers to stay awake alert and effective for up to seven days straight without suffering any deleterious mental or physical effects and without using any of the current generation of stimulants
8137691 the long term defense implications of finding ways to turn thoughts into acts if it can be developed are enormous imagine u s warfighters that only need use the power of their thoughts to do things at great distances
8137692 inspiration from nature will allow more lifelike qualities in the system
8137693 were interested in investigating biological organisms because they have evolved over many many years to be particularly good at surviving in the environment and we hope to learn from some of those strategies that mother nature has developed
8137694 the new security plan should also include shia cities like hwaider khirnabat and abara
8137695 the forces of the new security plan took all our weapons to the extent that we cannot fight al qaeda any more we are impotent
8137696 no shia vip or layman has been arrested since the launch of the security plan
8137697 success of the propaganda campaign known as negotiations with the palestinians which convinces many that the status quo is temporary
8137698 olmerts proposal for a land swap introduces a new stage in the arrangement israel would immediately receive the settlement blocs but the land to be transferred to the palestinians and the free passage between gaza and the west bank would only be delivered after the pa retakes control of the gaza strip
8137699 over the past few months olmert has approved construction of thousands of housing units in these settlement blocs mostly around jerusalem and some are intended for the voluntary evacuees
8137700 any left wing meretz faction member could have signed on to olmerts proposal
8137701 israel also presented the palestinians with a detailed model of new security arrangements under the proposed agreement
8137702 the palestinians oppose any israeli military presence in the territory of a future palestinian state
8137703 for its part israel would like to supervise border crossings maintain a limited deployment in the jordan valley continue overflights of the palestinian territory maintain early warning stations on mountain ridges and hold emergency response units in palestinian areas

8137708 its my latest project its almost done but i need to test it first
8137709 well well look who left all right princess sit tight and lets make this easy
8137710 wow no wonder you took so long this morning this hair is so complex dont mind if i mess it up do you
8137711 oh bleeding already are we why would any god anywhere want to make a species as pathetic as yours
8137712 my your pretty maybe i shouldnt kill you although what good would you be alive
8137713 oh im sorry am i hurting you maybe i should be more gentle
8137714 my intentions arent to kill you i just want to see how humans react to pain ive seen it once before but its so much more entertaining when you have a pretty girl in the mix
8137715 he laughed like it was a joke i felt the shard pain all my nerves screaming at me i could fell the hot liquid run down my arm
8137716 wow i really hope youre not a hemophiliac if so this is going to get messy
8137717 well you dont have to be all sour about it
8137718 i hate hating you your too beautiful to be disliked even by someone like me let me change you this thing will change you for the better a step for zanes people you would do that for him wouldnt you be different for him it will be better for all of us do it for zane for you for us
8137719 you will be the definition of beauty power you will be the twilight princess
8137720 because your pathetic these people are pathetic if this works it will let us take it back
8137721 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8137722 the greens are very opposed to these painful and sometimes lethal stun guns being introduced into the police armoury
8137723 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8137724 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8137725 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8137726 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8137727 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8137728 they havent known each other very well or very long and sen obama ran against his wife and theres still some bruised feelings but i think the president and sen obama are trying very hard to reach across that divide
8137729 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and trying to help middle class families and it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
8137730 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8137731 there was some tension there it was a long battle and thats what politics is about
8137732 its a little bit like relationships you fight and you reconcile
8137733 you could argue that no one is ready to be president
8137734 sen clinton has pledged her whole support to my campaign as has president clinton
8137735 i think you will see during the course of this week that the democrat party is energized and determined to take the white house back
8137736 hell not only transform the nation hes going to transform the world
8137737 and im glad to be on the trip with him
8137738 we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrifices our moral standing around the world
8137739 ladies and gentlemen thats the bad news but there is good news america we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain

8137754 it sounded like a crazy idea but i do a lot of bike riding
8137755 i feel better doing a 100 mile bike ride than after 100 rounds of golf i dont like to play 18 holes of stroke play i like doing things out of the ordinary the weather cooperated im having some soreness but i enjoyed it
8137756 sunscreen and a good pair of golf shoes are important when you play 100 holes
8137757 i thought if anybody could pull it off chris would do it
8137758 everybody was told in the pro shop what i was going to do
8137759 no one had a problem with it the club members are great monday is the least busiest day and the kids were back in school
8137760 i think ill get somebody to go with me and play
8137761 next year well try to help somebody with the idea
8137762 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8137763 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8137764 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8137765 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8137766 thats going to be interesting because ive never been in that position before
8137767 i know one thing im going to be one proud father to have my boys out there on the field
8137768 i wanted to go to smu that was something that i put my mind to because of my uncle and my dad
8137769 i told ben the same thing my dad told me
8137770 even though i would have loved to see the legacy continue and it was in the back of my mind the value of commitment is important to us too
8137771 weve been talking about this game for months my three sisters are so excited they want to make t shirts practically my whole support system is going to be there
8137772 of course they probably wont side with one particular team they just want to see both of us do well
8137773 he was always coming in to the locker room talking to us
8137774 to me hes unparalleled he treats everybody like his family when i was in florida i got a chance to become his friend and the stories he shared with me about overcoming adversity early in his ventures to be successful meant a lot to me
8137775 id better watch that you meet some random stranger from the internet and she talks about taking your daughter
8137776 it is a sad day for anyone who knew him and the type of person he was
8137777 as long as we dont get any more heavy rains i feel golfers will be getting a good course this week and into the holiday weekend
8137778 the really only time we get in trouble with water is when the creek gets out of its banks
8137779 we were unable to mow fairways and roughs for five days
8137780 the bunkers did wash but have all been put back there was no standing water on any holes
8137781 with the exception of a very heavy storm two saturdays ago most of the rain was slow and steady and more helpful to the courses than anything
8137782 i have never enjoyed playing golf in the rain but the better prepared you are the better you will play
8137783 i highly suggest buying a good pair of rain gloves they really allow you to hold onto the club in wet rainy conditions
8137784 other than that do all that you can to keep your equipment as dry as possible keep plenty of towels in your bag and always carry an umbrella
8137785 the two suggestions i can give are to move up a tee box so you will play about the same yardages into the greens with less roll
8137786 also to hit the ball solid whether it is wet or dry you must make contact with the golf ball first and the ground second when the grass is wet the water gets in between the club and ball and can cause the ball to squirt sideways
8137787 everybody thinks grooves are for spin but what they dont know is that they also work like treads on tires moving water away from the face of the club keep your clubs clean
8137788 barack obama er min kandidat og han skal v re vores pr sident
8137789 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8137790 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8137791 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8137792 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8137793 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8137794 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8137795 i know its going to be bad my leg felt like it was going to fall off like it was hanging by a string
8137796 its day to day man but im way ahead of schedule
8137797 in my own mind i probably thought i could have come this far this fast but most people were saying no way id be even be talking about coming back in august theyd say 8 10 games minimum but ill be back way before that
8137798 i always knew i was destined to get back out here it was just something i was going to have to work through this is going to be a continuous process but i havent had a setback the whole time its amazing where im at as long as i keep from taking any steps backward its all good
8137799 if they want to give me more time to get as well as possible im fine with that im at a point where i feel good im going to keep going and well talk about it when the time comes
8137800 but i cant wait for him to get back on the field hes a very physical corner probably the most physical player on our defense when that comes from your corner thats speaking volumes from every standpoint you miss a guy like him its real hard to replace a dunta robinson
8137801 its going to be different to come out and guard these guys
8137802 that will be the test thats when ill know what ive got how close i am im doing everything you can think of doing by myself without actually facing a receiver ive got a little soreness in the back of my leg from the hamstring not the knee it doesnt keep me from working as hard as i possibly can but yeah theres a little pain
8137803 i felt harrys pain because i got carted off the same way
8137804 i hate it that he wont be able to play again but hell have his health and thats the most important thing
8137805 were going to kill all those stories right now i like playing safety i played it most of my life until my junior year in college but im a corner now thats it i didnt come into this league to play safety at least not yet ten 11 years down the line maybe
8137806 i was fine until they actually started playing watching the guys running around on the field that can be a dangerous thing you start telling yourself well maybe i can do that too but im listening to my knee its a long process i know that im not going to rush anything
8137807 one of the guys who kind of motivates me is carlos rogers
8137808 his injury wasnt quite as bad as mine but he did have an acl and a medial collateral ligament injury and i watched him play the other night here was a guy who was laying right next to me we went through the same pain the same agonies of rehabbing it helped me to see him out there running normal
8137809 when i came to from my surgery dr andrews came into my room and i could tell he was happy about the work hed done he was bragging saying you had a lot of surgery but i did a great job youll be 100 percent hearing him say those words being so happy i knew i was going to give it all when i got back out here

8137813 i didnt like els i was working one or two days a week the rest im sitting home with no money i got maybe 180 a week thats no money
8137814 and the problem was i would get up at 5am and go to work but after one hour i had to go back home because nobody told me i had the day off then the next day i would have no work this happened many times
8137815 every week there was a problem sometimes they didnt pay any money and they didnt pay sick money i was sick for six weeks and i didnt get any money
8137816 the workers in the factory seemed to be happy the information that was received by the gla was received through their intelligence network we dont have access to and that unearthed the wrongdoings
8137817 we came up with a plan together with sainsburys to directly employ the workers to make sure they had proper housing and were paid a fair wage
8137818 hence we can employ a number of workers directly but we still have to top up with agency labour at times the pool that were fishing in for workers is getting smaller and smaller
8137819 theres less immigration from eastern europe theres more people going home again because the economies there are better and the devaluation of the euro has affected the value of their wages
8137820 so it makes good sense for us to look after our staff because we need to get enough workers to do our crops
8137821 im a lucky man because when els left the factory the farm gave me a contract so now here i have a good life
8137822 now after one or two months i can buy things that i only dream about in poland for example i have a plasma tv and a car
8137823 and its not only money here i have prospects here i can go to school for example so maybe not in the winter because its busy in the winter but next summer ill go to school i like history
8137824 i want to stay here i dont think ill go back to poland maybe to another country but i think ill stay here
8137825 realistically were going to have to go through the process of trying to find another affiliate preferably in that league
8137826 we wont know if one is available until after the season
8137827 the only other option is the california league but our first choice is to stay in the carolina league
8137828 the idea is to get it right and i think the umpires have done a pretty good job to this point its always great to be able to look at in the screen like that
8137829 i dont think it happens that frequently where its going to slow down the game
8137830 actually it wont slow down the game at all because if the crew chief decides to look at the replay it takes as long as the four umpires getting together
8137831 i want to be way over 500 you can go back through the summer and see some games that got away from us and would have put us right smack in the middle of the wild card hunt but other teams can say the same thing
8137832 from what i see it clearly went over the line
8137833 from my seat i thought it wasnt but i when i talked to him a little bit he said he saw it as going out once i got back to the dugout everybody said they saw it go out we still need replay no question
8137834 he kept the ball low and mixed it up real well and had command of all his pitches when hes doing that you just try to battle we hit some balls hard and some were caught those days happen
8137835 his command was good and breaking ball was good i thought he attacked the bottom of the strike zone really well with his fastball and thats what we want wandy to do
8137836 i was holding it here near the waist and i moved it up here in front of his face
8137837 i feel more comfortable every pitch i threw was better my breaking ball my fastball
8137838 i threw a bad pitch but it was hit well it was good pitch it was a strike but it was bad location
8137839 i just hoped the umpire was going to make the wrong call
8137840 i was going to play it off like it was a hit but i could see it from my perspective and he made the right call you cant take it away from him
8137841 i dont know if they saw i saw a difference in them whereas they might have seen one in me when i talked to them about this is game week
8137842 man this is what its all about this is fun
8137843 so i didnt give them a chance to show me what they had as much as i wanted to explain what this was all about how excited they should be
8137844 he gets down there and defensive end mike bennett had already left so now he is mad because mike left
8137845 he wasnt saying much anyways so he went back inside and i was sitting out there talking to associate athletic director for football operations tim cassidy like did i do something
8137846 i wasnt sure what was going on but cassidy was like nah its just game week hes going to be like that
8137847 im doing work now but today or thursday itll start to hit me a little bit but you know its fun
8137848 you hope your coaching beats their coaching your players beat their players i will say this theyre a very well coached football team in all phases this is a good challenge for us
8137849 i tell you theyre not going to be intimidated coming into kyle field
8137850 theyve had opportunities in the past every year they play some of the top teams in the country theyve played in front of a lot of great crowds going to tennessee or going to austin and playing well so that part of it wont happen theyll be ready to play theyre very well coached
8137851 from my perspective we are going to have to play our best game
8137852 they are not going to be intimidated by who we are or this place or anything
8137853 they play big time schools every year and play them well their best games of the year seem to come against the best teams this is the first game of the year so they are healthy they are excited and they are going to have a lot of energy we know its going to be a great contest
8137854 ive had a chance to play and be healthy so im excited to be here
8137855 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8137856 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8137857 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8137858 well thats not my place to make those decisions on when cuts are made but youve had those kids all the way through up to this point and now youre two days away from playing your last game and you have to let a couple of guys go
8137859 this is a team with great kids and a lot of potential
8137860 it has really been fun so far and i am just excited about this season and what we can do
8137861 its a great district for volleyball and i think we are playing some tough teams to prepare for that now
8137862 never handle biscuit dough any longer than it takes to just mix the ingredients
8137863 i have got to bring a notebook along with me to the bookstore
8137864 you see what is going on today in your homeland people are rejoicing it couldnt have happened without you
8137865 brothers we always believed russia would keep its promise but we didnt think it would be so soon
8137866 now we can forget about war forever and our children can sleep peacefully at night
8137867 through the efforts of the most just and humane state on the planet russia the bloodshed has been stopped

8137891 thats 37 pounds of marijuana that is not going to be sold to the citizens of new hanover county
8137892 weve definitely stepped up our efforts to intercept and investigate these packages
8137893 but last week police taped papers in the windows reading

8137895 see honey you can be anything you want to be
8137896 the sky widened farther and farther the sea below became a dazzling gleaming sheet of steel the temperature rose in an almost terrifying way that seemed to have no relation to the tropical sun
8137897 the white smoke had by now enveloped us it was hot water vapor mixed with the curiously attractive smell of sulfur dioxide and dust
8137898 the mechanics of the making of the world were all in evidence just a few feet ahead of where i stood
8137899 the power of the process was all too apparent here also in the strangely compelling symphony of grinding and snortings and sulfurous snarlings in all the rushings of yellow and green gases and in the snapping and straining of the rocks and crystals and crusts
8137900 there is an anomaly between the legislation for knife crime and gun crime where gun crime carries much stiffer penalties
8137901 we all know a knife can kill just as easily as a gun so there is a great anomaly there a knife amnesty on its own wont be a solution

8137908 there is no doubt in our mind as to who this belonged to
8137909 chief lacroix was never suspected to have possessed this with the intention of using it
8137910 i want to make it very clear that throughout my more than 36 year career as a firefighter i have never imperiled the safety of newton firefighters or the general public by using or possessing illegal drugs
8137911 a lot of people here have been very supportive by getting the testing done it takes a lot of pressure off them
8137912 i have every reason to believe chief lacroix had no knowledge that there were illicit drugs in his city vehicle
8137913 in todays society there is a vast majority of families that are infected by this problem my family is not immune to that
8137914 the message wasnt getting home so we had to take it to another step
8137915 i am a little disappointed in some of the firefighters who fostered the story in a negative way
8137916 its a family matter and a deep personal matter and i am disappointed that some did not have trust in me
8137917 ive been as open as i possibly can and i dont believe i have done anything wrong other than maybe i should have called the police up front
8137918 i want to make it clear that chief lacroix is being treated and will continue to be treated no differently than any other city employee would be treated under these circumstances
8137919 firefighters should be held on an upper plateau anyone in public safety is held at a higher standard there is a public trust that goes with that and we should not betray that public trust
8137920 drug use is a disease in todays society it happens so frequently if it goes unchecked its just going to spread

8137929 that is ending on a minute by minute hour by hour basis i have to say sen clinton has been wonderful in the way she has been out there supporting the obama campaign
8137930 the media is trying to make divisions into a story line but there is little division left
8137931 we will learn more with sen clintons speech whether there will be a formal roll call vote or not i think that is a moving target
8137932 i got the text message at 3 in morning like everyone else
8137933 the goal is simple doing whatever we can to elect barack obama president of the united states
8137934 its about the presidency thats what the whole convention is about
8137935 ted kennedys dramatic return to the democratic convention rallied us into action to remember we have a job to finish and a legacy to continue that was started by president john kennedy
8137936 sen kennedy is certainly an inspiration to all of us in massachusetts and around the nation
8137937 i have been around politics for over 30 years and that was one of the best political speeches ive seen in my life
8137938 she was genuine and she laid out why her husband should be elected president of the united states
8137939 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord

8137951 labour party donor owen glenns letter to the privileges committee completely contradicts winston peters version of events about the substantial 100 000 donation made by mr glenn to mr peters legal costs
8137952 from parliaments point of view the privileges committee provides an appropriate vehicle to resolve the points of conflict and to hold individuals to account but from the prime ministers and the governments point of view that is not enough
8137953 governments and ministers must enjoy the confidence of the parliament and ultimately the public faced with todays revelations it is no longer acceptable for mr peters to offer bluster and insults where simple courteous honest answers are required
8137954 it is no longer acceptable or credible for helen clark to assert a facade of confidence in her foreign affairs minister and to fail to ask the plain questions of him that she has a duty to the public to ask
8137955 faced with todays revelations helen clark must stand mr peters down as a minister that is what i would do if i were prime minister helen clark has stood ministers from labour down for much less
8137956 unless he can provide a credible explanation about this serious issue he should be unacceptable to helen clark as a minister in her labour led government
8137957 mr peters will be unacceptable as a minister in a government led by me unless he can provide a credible explanation

8137967 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy i think that rich should be defined by a home a good job an education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited
8137968 i think americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although weve been the best at it of everybody in the world
8137969 patriotism is the critical affirmation of ones country in light of its best values including the attempt to correct it when its in error nationalism is the uncritical support of ones nation regardless of its moral or political bearing

8138007 im vorjahr war der asphalt neu aber weitaus weniger aggressiv als andere neue bel ge obwohl es recht wellig war weil in misano viel gefahren wird ist der asphalt diesmal wohl noch weniger belastend f r die reifen sein
8138008 unser ziel muss es sein den vorderreifen zu verbessern obwohl misano wie gesagt mit br nn berhaupt nicht vergleichbar ist wir werden mittelweiche bis mittelharte mischungen verwenden es gibt aber einige langsame kurven wo am ausgang die beschleunigung einen wichtigen faktor darstellt deshalb ben tigen die piloten am hinterreifen eine sehr gute traktion

8138033 georgia didnt have control of these territories and now its even more unlikely that it will ever be able to reintegrate them if georgia tried it would probably escalate into military conflict again
8138034 the western choice is an historic and natural choice of the georgian people nothing can change this choice
8138035 georgia has been trying for a very long time to tell the world what has been going on they kept saying the russians were taking up new positions and putting new elements into play but people said they were exaggerating
8138036 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8138037 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8138038 it started in the loungeroom on one side of the house and it just took the rest of it within two minutes
8138039 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8138040 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8138041 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8138042 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out

8138050 fasting is an act of worship and not a custom
8138051 islam is built on five pillars the testimony that there is no god except allah and that muhammad is the messenger of allah establishing prayer paying
8138052 there has come to you ramadan a blessed month which allah has enjoined you to fast during which the gates of heaven are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the rebellious devils are chained up in it there is a night which is better than a thousand months and whoever is deprived of its goodness is indeed deprived
8138053 whoever spends laylat al qadr in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward will be forgiven his previous sins
8138054 whoever fasts ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward his previous sins will be forgiven
8138055 whoever spends the nights of ramadan in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward his previous sins will be forgiven
8138056 when ramadan comes the gates of paradise are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devils are chained up
8138057 at every breaking of the fast allah has people whom he redeems
8138058 the five daily prayers from one jumuah to the next and from one ramadan to the next are an expiation for sins committed in between so long as you avoid major sins
8138059 whoever prays qiyaam with the imam until he finishes it will be recorded for him that he spent the whole night in prayer
8138060 is equivalent to doing 10 it is sunnah to observe
8138061 every action of the son of adam is for him except for fasting it is for me and i will reward him for it beyond measure
8138062 no servant fasts a day for the sake of allah except that allah removes the hellfire seventy years away from his face
8138063 the fast and the quran are two intercessors for the servant of allah on the day of resurrection the fast will say o lord i prevented him from his food and desires during the day let me intercede for him the quran will say i prevented him from sleeping at night let me intercede for him and their intercession will be accepted
8138064 i came to the messenger of allah saas and said order me to do a deed that will allow me to enter paradise he said stick to fasting
8138065 there is a gate to paradise that is called ar rayyan on the day of resurrection it will say where are those who fasted when the last one has passed through the gate it will be locked
8138066 o people repent to allah for indeed i repent to him one hundred times each day
8138067 when typing i powerfully connect with henry mills forward looking ideas
8138068 just think then of how many people will be ahead of you for the jobs

8138072 were you in this campaign just for me she asked and the correct answer surprisingly was no
8138073 we did it before with president clinton and the democrats and if we do our part well do it again with president obama and the democrats
8138074 before we can keep going we have to get going by electing barack obama
8138075 i think the people of assam cannot ask for anything more as all these world class institutes could go a long way in developing the state in terms of human resource development
8138076 the package is really noteworthy as the prime minister instead of just doling out cash incentives decided to go for specified projects and that too with a vision aimed at developing the skills of local youths by way of setting up several top notch educational facilities
8138077 i have never come across a prime minister like manmohan singh who has generously agreed to all our proposals this shows how sincere and committed the prime minister is to the welfare and development of the state
8138078 i think all these time bound projects would help develop assam by leaps and bounds

8138110 i think this is a good compromise and it tackles a lot of concern that were brought up along the way most of us have kids and or are married and know we must sometimes pick our battles
8138111 i think we have picked the right battle and it is now time to compromise
8138112 this is a document that saves country club village isolates eola and uses sheffer as your own personal cut through for anything westbound
8138113 we were not considered this is not what we wanted
8138114 your putting through a road for one bank and youre destroying an entire community
8138115 i didnt like els i was working one or two days a week the rest im sitting home with no money i got maybe 180 a week thats no money
8138116 and the problem was i would get up at 5am and go to work but after one hour i had to go back home because nobody told me i had the day off then the next day i would have no work this happened many times
8138117 every week there was a problem sometimes they didnt pay any money and they didnt pay sick money i was sick for six weeks and i didnt get any money
8138118 the workers in the factory seemed to be happy the information that was received by the gla was received through their intelligence network we dont have access to and that unearthed the wrongdoings
8138119 we came up with a plan together with sainsburys to directly employ the workers to make sure they had proper housing and were paid a fair wage
8138120 hence we can employ a number of workers directly but we still have to top up with agency labour at times the pool that were fishing in for workers is getting smaller and smaller
8138121 theres less immigration from eastern europe theres more people going home again because the economies there are better and the devaluation of the euro has affected the value of their wages
8138122 so it makes good sense for us to look after our staff because we need to get enough workers to do our crops
8138123 im a lucky man because when els left the factory the farm gave me a contract so now here i have a good life
8138124 now after one or two months i can buy things that i only dream about in poland for example i have a plasma tv and a car
8138125 and its not only money here i have prospects here i can go to school for example so maybe not in the winter because its busy in the winter but next summer ill go to school i like history
8138126 i want to stay here i dont think ill go back to poland maybe to another country but i think ill stay here
8138127 i knew when i saw the draw it was a good opportunity against oudin and i thought i did pretty well today
8138128 i was pretty pumped about playing because i knew my opponent melanie we both played in the juniors together
8138129 i know i have the tennis in me its just allowing myself to play and believe in myself and thats what im working on and i think i did a good job today
8138130 i thought serving out the second set at 5 4 i didnt do it too well but then i came back in the tie breaker so it was good
8138131 my serve is something sandon coach sandon stolle and i have been working on and i think its going really well
8138132 its more a visual thing for me and thats what weve been working on
8138133 ive had a chance to play and be healthy so im excited to be here
8138134 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8138135 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes

8138142 i cant tell you how often i run into people from youngstown now living in miami or chicago or cleveland who stop me and say yeah i may live here but youngstown will always be my home this is an opportunity for those people to play an active role in our future economic success

8138171 before the last election jim doyle told the people of wisconsin in his state of the state address that we should not we must not and i will not raise taxes after the last election he introduced a state budget that raised taxes and fees by more than 3 billion
8138172 an undeniable inculpatory admission of the harvesting of falun gong practitioner prisoners for profit
8138173 caller what you used before were they from detention centers or prisons
8138174 c oh prisons and it was from healthy falun gong practitioners the healthy falun gong right
8138175 lg right right right we would choose the good ones because we will assure the quality of our operations
8138176 i told her the caller i was not involved in the surgical operations and had no idea where the organs come from i told her i could not answer her questions she then asked me whether these organs come from prisons i replied no to her in clear cut terms
8138177 so here we have on our recording an admission from a doctor that he and his colleagues used to go to a prison to select falun gong practitioners for their organs he does not just say that someone else did this he says that he and his colleagues used to do this themselves moreover we have a further admission that the voice we have on our recording is the voice of the very person our recording says he is
8138178 it has the sanction of the government of china the admission is accordingly one which is sanctioned and approved by the government of china and can not credibly be denied by the government
8138179 it seems every time i turn around somebody says ive seen this ive seen this
8138180 i was trying to better my life for my family and myself
8138181 before i could make an earnest effort uncle sam called
8138182 my point is if he cant manage his own business with a smaller dollar amount
8138183 the county commission will have to approve my budget and make sure i adhere to it
8138184 this is my question which probably needs to go to the ethics commission or the county
8138185 i wouldnt let someone run for office just to find out later whether they could or could not be bonded
8138186 there are a lot of under the table ways to do things
8138187 i just found out yesterday the county will bond me so if thats the case its a moot point

8138190 i presume that his biden integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8138191 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettable knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8138192 from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong of course we now know with biological certainly exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to chose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
8138193 i think some of it is regional it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
8138194 yes thats what the females in my cs classes looked like
8138195 barack obama est mon candidat et il doit tre notre pr sident

8138200 en ce moment crucial de notre histoire nous navons pas le droit lerreur

8138203 it would be a big win if we could do it but all we can guarantee is that well go out and give it everything not just count down the minutes in the game until the end of the season but just go out and enjoy the challenge of playing against a great side worsfold said
8138204 this week well go out to compete and play at our best and the expectation is probably not that were a great chance to win but anything can happen
8138205 you go out to get your match ups as good as you can get them give players great opportunities and you expect them to do their best
8138206 the hardest day they are ever going to have in their life but worsfold said his team was ready for the challenge
8138207 we are going to lap that up thats one thing for sure worsfold said
8138208 its a great learning environment for a lot of our players it will be a great learning environment for me
8138209 mark thompson has made a statement that is really directed at the geelong players more than at us
8138210 ireland bucks the trend but only slightly with the ratio of working age irish people to oaps going from 16pc now to 43pc in 2060
8138211 however population predictions are what if scenarios to give information about the future size and structure of populations based on current trends and need to be treated with caution
8138212 but projections of an ageing population increasingly dep endent on migrants in order to maintain the size of its working age population are a feature of all eu economies
8138213 in terms of outlook the main change is in the americas materials division with profits expected to decline by a low teen percentage this year
8138214 we had expected profits to increase combined with further signs of deterioration in the european products business this is likely to result in a reduction in our forecast
8138215 it would be a fairly serious step to break that record
8138216 we have not had much contact with him he doesnt seem interested either way he has not asked any questions about our organization
8138217 we havent spoken with them in over a week theres nothing new as he has not decided anything as of yet he had told me that he would be making a decision in the month of august and as it stands this is the 26th we will find out if that timetable is respected what his decision is by next week
8138218 well wait for word from him until september if neccessary on paper were the perfect team for him there is a place for him on this team
8138219 i know that there are other teams over the salary cap presently we will see should mats not come aboard maybe will discuss matters with these teams
8138220 id like to know if he is in fit shape
8138221 he is a 37 year old player and it is important for him that it is clear in his head that he is physically ready for a complete season
8138222 if you truly believe a pandemic outbreak is likely there is reason to believe foreign governments and the u s will clamp down and control the supply
8138223 other places in the world may have a lot of money but no amount of money will get you vaccines in the case of a pandemic
8138224 we see no reason to invest additional money of our own into the pandemic vaccine when we can wait for a foreign government that needs this vaccine to put money in
8138225 will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state
8138226 will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8138227 weve been very clear with north korea that there will be action for action
8138228 and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8138229 no debemos considerar nuestra sociedad ni nuestras instituciones como de por s da adas y viciadas sino como parte de una tradici n respetable
8138230 salmson said he stabbed the rooster with his athame the edge of the ivory knife wasnt keen enough to slice flesh but its point could split a birds chest blood followed as he withdrew the blade splashing the stone and his arm to the elbow
8138231 salmson repeated he stabbed again and the boys blood gushed
8138232 whats that thats coming out of the hole now hey
8138233 take the talisman by the grace of franca god over all gods it is given to you to conquer the kingdom of the isles
8138234 and what then when ive conquered the isles what of your folk in palomir
8138235 when the whole world worships franca then he will decide our fate
8138236 the whole world will look like this like the worms own world
8138237 im well aware of what an old terran cat looks like chris
8138238 i dont believe ive ever seen one quite at large but i do know what they are what i dont know is what its doing in my mothers townhouse
8138239 and just when did this monumental change in your status as a parent take place
8138240 i found him wandering around over near the master chiefs club he looked like he needed a home and he walked right up to me and i couldnt just leave him there maam
8138241 and would it happen that this hulking menace to all mice hamsters chipmunks and unwary small children has a name
8138242 you do realize how many regulations there are against having a pet on board one of her majestys starships
8138243 this is commander hal roach and he is here because of you but not because of anything youve done unless of course you have a guilty conscience i didnt know anything about
8138244 thanks for the compliment but what i mean is jacques pierre isnt interested in me i mean except for teaching me to meditate which must have been meant by the stars you know its sort of too bad hes in great condition
8138245 spending every day trotting alongside a wagon and heaving the contents of garbage cans into it will do that for the old biceps and triceps and abs i suppose several of the orderlies at the assisted living center why dont they tell the plain truth and call it an old folks home or a nursing home the way people used to are in really good shape too
8138246 il est probable que nous essuierons encore des pertes en afghanistan
8138247 weve got three people who through boredom or idiocy have gone down to the beachfront with a firearm to shoot randomly at things
8138248 shes a cop we kill them if we catch them on their own
8138249 were runaways too and lani is a wanted woman i believe not a cop
8138250 i dont think that you can still be part of the force lani not after beating up several officers in your attempt to find howard
8138251 look we just came to fetch howard were out of here
8138252 you and him especially know too much and also this stinks how did you get here at the same time as him how did you know where to come to to find him
8138253 a computer system i have never bothered to show the police
8138254 i hardly know who you are all we want is go to where we need to were not intending any harm to you
8138255 well youre not going to have a chance spread their legs boys captains get first share those of you who like a bit of bum can have him
8138256 it wont help you if they call anyone im gonna blow your stupid balls off first
8138257 i cannot let you do this it is a sin
8138258 thats what they were going to do us you idiot
8138259 you treat us like that why shouldnt we do the same or worse to you bitch
8138260 do unto others as ye would have them do unto you
8138261 yeah and if they turn around and kick you in the teeth
8138262 what you do then give them the rest of your teeth
8138263 we were just doing what they do to us a womans got to know her place up here
8138264 and we share and share alike here when we get one not fair that you keep her to yourself big one two is greedy anyway
8138265 although it doesnt seem to have gotten through to him
8138266 can we get out of here and you can argue about who belongs to whom somewhere less dangerous
8138267 youve got a point and now weve got these jerks to avoid as well as the force
8138268 ive thought about it i can get the computer to simply give me all warm bodies not just those over a certain weight we should be able to avoid any more charming incidents i do begin to understand why diana came into being
8138269 dont worry i wont shoot anyone as long as they co operate well keep this one as a hostage
8138270 im not hurting you yet but i will if you dont shut up ill let you go as soon as were in the clear idiot all right the rest of you lot move out and well move out too in opposite directions those of you who can walk take those who cant and dont try anything stupid i was top of my marksmanship class
8138271 a group of people in our way a force patrol by the looks of it judging by the individual weights
8138272 the minimum fines stipulated in the decree should outweigh the cost of enforcement and act as a deterrent for possible future offences
8138273 often the fines imposed by the magistrate are not enough to recover the enforcement costs
8138274 it was basically like getting thrown out into the jungle not knowing where you were going not knowing what you were doing trying to survive
8138275 you cant even make a comparison it was very surprising to me i was overwhelmed
8138276 one thing about carl is hes getting more confident with every snap
8138277 now that he understands the offense hes playing fast and when you play fast and you play consistent youre going to have a chance to be successful in our offense im excited about what hes been doing
8138278 i definitely wouldnt have been ready to play this fall if i hadnt been here in the spring it was a good thing
8138279 i know the plays now and physically ive changed a lot i was like 269 pounds when i got here now im 290 pounds and have like only 16 percent body fat ive really changed a lot and its helped me
8138280 they would be non functional people now if they were not here in the spring
8138281 you all saw how carl moore looked in the spring now hes very dallas baker esque you say that name with reverence around here because he was such a good player for us he shows some of those same qualities
8138282 epps without spring football would not be ready now hes in the mix to either start or see a lot of playing time
8138283 i know my adjustments i know how to read the defense so right now i can say im really comfortable with the offense im really excited about playing
8138284 i knew i had an opportunity in the summer to get everything and learn everything i knew it was up to me i knew i determined my future so i knew if i put the work in id be fine
8138285 i had to learn a whole new system and get used to a whole new environment
8138286 thats a lot of responsibility and its hard to joke about that although maybe me being zachs replacement is kind of funny huh
8138287 but if he ever asks me for any help i aint telling him nothing
8138288 its like those old cars back in the day that had to be cranked back up
8138289 we got a new defense and were still learning it when you first start cranking the wheel its hard but when you get the momentum going and you get oil moving it starts going much smoother
8138290 he loves to talk he never gets tired of hearing himself talk
8138291 regardless of how much we get tired of hearing him talk he never gets tired of talking hes pretty much always the same he is crazy
8138292 on my locker my name is in paper its not even a real plaque so they can get rid of that thing real fast if i talk too much
8138293 youve gotta be ready to play if hes ready to play hell play
8138294 you think youre going to start but you dont really know sometimes your play just takes care of it and if you just keep making plays during practice and keep working hard and the coaches start believing in you then you know youre going to start when i was getting the coaches believing in me i felt like i was good to go
8138295 i gotta be careful because i usually pump guys up too much and they break our hearts
8138296 hes really worked hard if i can get him to shave hell be much better hes had a great camp
8138297 he sprained his ankle the other day and hes a battler
8138298 hes not with those other running backs right now hes a little bit behind them he cant get off the injury list i think hes not that far behind i just think the other guys are more consistent
8138299 this team is not going to be one of the ones
8138300 were very very motivated not to be the team that doesnt win the sec
8138301 i think its a really big motivator for all of us knowing there are 17 and we want to be the 18th
8138302 it will be a different team but were going for the same goals
8138303 i remember the day that we told our players that the rule had been passed and how excited they were
8138304 ive heard different reactions from athletes around the country but our athletes were thrilled they grew up playing to 25 points and theyve watched it in the olympics thats what theyre used to its less of an adjustment for them than it is for us as coaches
8138305 if a starter emerges were going to go with one starter instead of splitting halfs were splitting games right now
8138306 for the ocean liner scenes in addition to the actual vessel its smoke funnels and 50 crew members we were called upon to digitally create the environment of stormy seas and crashing waves we even created an interior for the ship that we projected into the windows in order to give the proper sense of depth for the army scenes using a variety of source material we added everything from digital tents and vehicles to the lancaster bombers
8138307 since we had the velocity of the boat and the velocity of the waves as we were able to create a geo version from the displacement shader code we knew the summed velocity at the boat water intersection and to automatically birth splash particles at this point
8138308 additional painted attributes allowed us to tweak the splash height spread and shape
8138309 white people dont feel bad whatever you do to them they deserve it god wants you to do it and thats when you cut out the nose cut out the ears take flesh out of their body dont worry because god wants you to do it
8138310 if obama is worried about ayers his day just got a whole lot worse
8138311 never tapped into the character and resolve of the american people

8138313 this is an extraordinary example of a creative shift in thinking that truly places new zealand in the twenty first century
8138314 insulating all houses and reducing fuel poverty by compensating residential electricity users for raised prices should lead to evident health benefits for all new zealanders
8138315 the present poor energy efficiency of our houses in new zealand has had serious public health consequences
8138316 many of our homes were built in the late 19th century and the early part of the 20th when energy seemed so cheap we just used lots of it with the certainty of climate change we dont have the luxury of doing that any more

8138441 while ted kennedy and michelle obama were rocking the democratic convention in denver john mccain made his 13th appearance with jay leno to joke about his age
8138442 mccain is two years older than his father was when he died suddenly of a heart attack at 70 he is 11 years older than his grandfather was when he died suddenly of a heart attack at age 61
8138443 the united states cannot afford the risk that mccain would die suddenly in the middle of an international crisis
8138444 mccain has never had an alzheimers test even though he has 6 of the 10 warning signs including his inability to remember recent facts like the number of homes he owns the 1m lawsuit he filed in 1990 or the u s invasion of iraq in 2003

8138492 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
8138493 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
8138494 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
8138495 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives

8138513 routinely surveying different groups in different years to get different perspectives to figure out how were doing is the backbone of continuous improvement efforts
8138514 they asked her to stay because of the current political uncertainty
8138515 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8138516 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8138517 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8138518 i think the fact that it seems to be taking several weeks just to have a phone call with opposition leaders i think indicates frankly a much deeper issue and that is that this parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
8138519 today is an additional episode of a continuing saga of a fabricated emergency by the prime minister
8138520 he wants to meet me and to pretend that the meeting went so badly that he needs to call an election thats what its all about
8138521 now hes saying i want to meet the leaders of the opposition i want them to accept my agenda what is his agenda nobody has any idea of what is his agenda maybe not himself and you want me to agree with it on the phone this is a joke
8138522 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is sic going to solve the sectarian violence there
8138523 overall violence is down at least 80 percent since the surge began and ethno sectarian violence the kind that seemed to be sucking iraq into all out civil war in 2006 is down by over 90 percent
8138524 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
8138525 as we have surged into neighborhoods to protect the iraqi people earning their trust and benefiting from their help violence has dropped and locals have turned against the jihadists
8138526 the iraqi people are going about their business and business is thriving it is so more and more i see it in places i could not go even six months ago
8138527 the simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isnt the answer in fact its a tragic mistake
8138528 it wont end the violence it wont provide security it wont turn back the clock and avoid the civil war that is already underway it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
8138529 the group will focus on education religion and social justice
8138530 its like squeezing a water balloon you squeeze it in one place it bulges somewhere else
8138531 the surge was designed to give the iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution
8138532 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
8138533 in baghdad parks are filled every weekend with families playing and picnicking with their children

8138539 when a recession hits businesses often cope with the changes by making budget cuts which can result in employees being laid off
8138540 those laid off employees are often some of the most affected consumers during a recession unlike their former employers cutting their budgets may not be enough to get through the tough times not preparing for these economic surprises in advance is a common problem because no one wants to think it will happen to them fortunately its a problem that can be alleviated starting today with a few changes

8138555 a book like the amazing remarkable monsieur leotard would have been good had only half of the effort gone into it but campbell and best have instead gone all out and created a comic masterpiece
8138556 with campbell you get the whole package not a page of the book gets wasted and theres something to entertain at every glance
8138557 campbells light touch with the art beautiful yet often disturbing watercolors proves supple and fluid enough to convey scenes of whimsy and scenes of horror this might just be my favorite campbell yet i cant recommend it highly enough
8138558 you will love rediscovering the joy of a wild adventure comic that you cant stop reading you will love laughing at each inevitable change of fortune that makes leotards life so amazing so remarkable you will love once again letting eddie and dan best take hold of your consciousness and imagination and turn them inside out and upside down on the wildest ride youll find in comics this year
8138559 campbells artwork meanwhile is beyond beauty his color work here crosses styles and genres and employs some brilliant panel placement as well

8138565 we are already flying to abu dhabi and sharjah so dubai is obviously losing out if we are able to pursue the civil aviation authority to allow us entry into dubai we would have a substantial number of travellers flying into dubai from saudi arabia

8138611 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8138612 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8138613 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8138614 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8138615 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8138616 its important to remember that there are real people and families behind these statistics

8138691 its hard to think of a single speech that did more

8138705 gold is still consolidating for the time being but it seems the market is still a little bit worried about the global economy
8138706 private investors have gradually shown interest in gold and the oil price has also reached its bottom within this week its possible for gold to reach 835 or 840
8138707 gold near 800 remains vulnerable in the near term to a stronger dollar
8138708 but it is underpinned by rising physical demand in key global markets deteriorating macroeconomic and financial environments accelerating inflation and tight supply demand fundamentals

8138727 we welcome the release of hu shigen but it is tragic that hu had to suffer so many years of abuse serious health problems and harsh conditions
8138728 she did a great job i think she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election she was outstanding
8138729 it was then that i realized that there was injustice in the world and that if you wanted to be in a position where you could fight against it you would have to work terribly hard
8138730 you would have to make sacrifices in my case i would have to go to law school one of the top law schools and to get in i would have to exceed any demands that any law school could make on me
8138731 im not this smart guy im just average but i got motivated
8138732 you and i are told increasingly that we have to choose between a left or right but i would like to suggest that there is no such thing as a left or right there is only an up or down up to a mans age old dream the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order or down to the ant heap totalitarianism and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course
8138733 men and women who turn their lives over to god will discover that he can make a lot more out of their lives than they can he will deepen their joys expand their vision quicken their minds strengthen their muscles lift their spirits multiply their blessings increase their opportunities comfort their souls raise up friends and pour out peace whoever will lose his life in the service of god will find eternal life

8138737 i was with a lot of the clinton staff this afternoon and i think this is being built up to be much more than it really is
8138738 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
8138739 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8138740 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope that is why i love this country

8138757 pew research center study showing the network has the most balanced audience in cable news 39 percent republicans and 33 percent democrats
8138758 but being out of touch with mainstream america is nothing new to jon as evidenced by the crash and burn ratings of this years oscars telecast

8138774 solicitor general ted olson has described the process there is no requirement for the executive branch to spell out its criteria for who qualifies as an illegal combatant
8138775 in other words what is safe to say today might imperil your freedom or your life tomorrow you can never know if you are on the right side of the law because the law is merely whim of the leader and his minions their instincts determine your guilt or innocence and these gut feelings can change from day to day this is now formally and officially the guiding principle of the united states government and underlying this edifice of tyranny is the prerogative of presidential murder
8138776 perhaps the enormity of this monstrous perversion of law and morality has kept it from being fully comprehended it sounds unbelievable to most people but that is our reality to overcome what seems to be widespread cognitive dissonance we need only examine the publicly available record there is nothing that any ordinary citizen could not know if they choose to know it
8138777 bush signed orders allowing cia assassins to kill targets without seeking presidential approval nor is it necessary any longer for the president to approve new names added to the target list the security organs can designate and kill as they see fit there is no way of knowing how many people have been killed by american agents operating outside judicial process most of the assassinations are carried out in secret quietly professionally the death squads are able to operate clandestinely using a full range of official and non official cover arrangements to enter countries surreptitiously
8138778 everything secret degenerates even the administration of justice nothing is safe that does not show it can bear discussion and publicity
8138779 the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them
8138780 god told me to strike at al qaeda and i struck at them and then he instructed me to strike at saddam which i did
8138781 since a human being has no power to create life he has therefore no right to destroy life
8138782 to force a man to pay for the violation of his own liberty is indeed adding insult to injury but that is exactly what the state does read the congressional record follow the proceedings of the state legislatures examine our statute books testing each act separately by the law of equal liberty you will find that a good nine tenths of existing legislation serves not to that fundamental social law but either to prescribe the individuals personal habits or worse to create and sustain commercial industrial financial and proprietary monopolies which deprive labor of a large part of the reward that it would receive in a true free market
8138783 how much traffic does my site bring to the chatroom
8138784 omg thats it porgys has like 4 times the meat at a quarter the cost
8138785 well keep everyone abreast of continued new nfl betting product releases
8138786 i can ad text and text links in the language editor but how do i add graphics
8138787 nwa people told me well you know this is something the computer generates
8138788 some airlines do a very good job of matching to the watch lists and the cleared lists and some do not
8138789 we also send what is called a cleared list those would be individuals who might have a similar name but we have verified their identity and know those people are indeed not on a watch list
8138790 we dont put senators or reporters or others who are critical of the government on watch lists there are not millions of people on watch lists
8138791 we as an industry have to do a better job working with the tsa on the language we use when we have identified somebody who has a name that matches someone on the list
8138792 the bottom line is the whole idea of putting this list together was government initiated
8138793 and i believe we have a responsibility to fix it
8138794 the navigon 7200t is for discerning users who are looking for next generation navigation features wrapped in a stunning design
8138795 it embodies exactly what navigon represents smart useful features backed by elegant design
8138796 dont pray then say amen and run away before god has a chance to reply
8138797 this is the core of the appendage it takes a pressure event and translates it into three unique control voltages continuous intial value and differential and produces the timing signal for gate and trigger everything past that is downhill these signals can be manipulated to do an astounding number of things simultaneously the way i see it if you want a standard ribbon controller go buy the doepfer from the videos ive seen its pretty cool the appendage however is going to be a different beast i envision it as a cross between a ribbon controller and a buchlian gestural controller position relative position rate of movement direction of movement split even into different directions will be able to control any parameter your synthesizer has simultaneously mixing these control voltages is fascinating for example the amount of control mixing differential with initial provides is surprising mixing slide with initial creates a sort of hyper range slide with slide bends the curve radically ive even discovered a neat trill function quite by accident
8138798 heres an idea for an appendage controlled touch sequencer which would be sort of like the serge touch sequencer but rather different as well
8138799 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
8138800 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated

8138802 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning

8138804 ich habe gerade ein gentest ergebnis bekommen ich bin erbkrank muss ich mich jetzt sterilisieren lassen
8138805 diese genvariante kommt bei etwa zehn prozent der bev lkerung vor und hat so gut wie nichts zu bedeuten
8138806 die mitteilung von ergebnissen aus genomsequenzierungen muss durch speziell geschulte berater erfolgen
8138807 die buchstaben und worte im genom zu entziffern ist heutzutage lediglich ein technisches problem diese worte zu entschl sseln ihnen die richtige bedeutung zuzuweisen ist die eigentliche herausforderung

8138811 sappiamo benissimo hanno detto che la nostra iniziativa non risolve il problema si tratta di una goccia in un mare ma vogliamo lanciare un segnale di solidariet che parte dalla locride una terra che spesso conosciuta solo per fatti negativi
8138812 ho ricevuto ha detto lucano una telefonata dal prefetto giuseppe forlani al quale ho illustrato la nostra idea forlani mi sembrato abbastanza interessato e mi ha detto di fare presto a formulare una proposta in modo che la macchina organizzativa possa iniziare a muoversi
8138813 noi siamo per laccoglienza e lintegrazione e non certo per il filo spinato
8138814 lidea di accogliere gli immigrati nella locride ha aggiunto vuole essere un messaggio che va in direzione opposta a quello del sindaco di lampedusa il quale pensa che limmigrazione solo un problema di ordine pubblico e poi propone di mettere il filo spinato intorno al centro noi invece siamo convinti che gli immigrati sono una risorsa
8138815 lesperienza ha proseguito lucano che abbiamo vissuto a riace in questi anni dimostra che gli immigrati sono una risorsa che bisogna valorizzare gli immigrati da noi hanno contribuito alla rivitalizzazione del centro storico abbiamo realizzato lalbergo diffuso con opportunit di lavoro per i ragazzi del luogo c stato il recupero delle attivit artigianali anche con il mescolarsi di esperienze portate dagli immigrati
8138816 lampedusa aggiunge ha dimostrato in questi anni di sapere accogliere questa povera gente ed stata desempio per tutti ma io ho il dovere di denunciare che 2 mila persone non possono essere ospitate in una struttura nata inizialmente per accogliere 381 immigrati e successivamente 762
8138817 perch lo stato non riesce a reperire posti allinterno dei diversi cpt dove trasferire gli immigrati sbarcati a lampedusa
8138818 e questo sottolinea de ribeis anche a causa dellopposizione da parte di sindaci e presidenti di regione
8138819 un deterrente per impedire la fuga di alcuni extracomunitari come avvenuto nei giorni scorsi quando io stesso ne ho trovati tre completamente ubriachi
8138820 i wouldnt be surprised if in a year or two more start popping up
8138821 it eases the parents financial burden and then with peer pressure and discipline and academic achievement studies are showing how much it helps
8138822 you can see who belongs where and who doesnt and for people worried about individual self expression students can do that with their sneakers
8138823 money cant buy friends but it can get you a better class of enemy
8138824 there is a good chance that if there is no movement the teachers will be out on strike on sept 2
8138825 were looking for cost containment they are asking for more benefits with no additional costs to them in the real world today thats not happening
8138826 i hope we will make enough progress monday that it will encourage them to continue to teach and negotiate until we come to a resolution
8138827 that would certainly be my fantasy but i dont know if thats going to happen
8138828 there is a lot of misinformation people saying that all our kids are parolees with ankle bracelets
8138829 just like every other community deals with there will be more activity when schools going on but the students wont really be intermingling with the community
8138830 its always been a school we thought there really wasnt a need to go and do that
8138831 this is a very residential area we dont know what problems the kids are going to have because no ones bothered to tell us
8138832 this is literally a scandal as far as im concerned
8138833 to go ahead and do this without any community involvement it just seems wrong
8138834 oil markets are keeping a nervous eye on hurricane gustav with forecasts showing it may move into the gulf of mexico
8138835 as well diplomatic tensions involving russia have intensified following russias decision to recognise as independent states both south ossetia and abkhazia
8138836 for oil traders it is another weekend of storm watch
8138837 there is a good chance that if there is no movement the teachers will be out on strike on sept 2
8138838 were looking for cost containment they are asking for more benefits with no additional costs to them in the real world today thats not happening
8138839 i hope we will make enough progress monday that it will encourage them to continue to teach and negotiate until we come to a resolution
8138840 our first accountability is to the taxpayers of this district for the last three years they have gotten raises of about 2 2 percent our proposal is closer to that than to the unions demands
8138841 that would certainly be my fantasy but i dont know if thats going to happen
8138842 teachers will return to work without a contract and without significant progress being made in negotiations since january
8138843 as long as the two sides are talking and progress is being made thats a good thing
8138844 it reflects a change in the wider society and the public attention on issues of global warming and the rising cost of energy
8138845 much of it is driven by students theyre seeing their future in this
8138846 al gores efforts have had a significant role to play and its katrina its haze over beijing its more hybrid cars they all start to pile up and after a while its hard not to pay attention
8138847 i just know were going to run out of stuff and thats not going to be good for anybody
8138848 our program is going to focus on solutions working with companies and organizations to create sustainable approaches to what they do
8138849 its definitely a job market thats going to increase in the future as more communities more businesses try to tackle the idea of sustainability we want to train people for those leadership jobs
8138850 i love it where i live and i dont want to see it developed
8138851 i was reading that about 40 percent of pollution coming from the car happens in the first two minutes or first two miles
8138852 if we could avoid those short trips we could eliminate a lot of pollution from cars and vehicles
8138853 this is one of the issues that is universally supported by students and faculty
8138854 people today get it that we all have to do our part to make a difference
8138855 it was nice to have derek out for a little bit and back around the team
8138856 hopefully on monday well have everyone inside rehabilitating back on the field and well begin preparations for the dallas game
8138857 joe feels good about being able to rehab and come around so well see how it turns out
8138858 but if we didnt think he could play he wouldnt be on the pup
8138859 that spot is up for grabs and we all know who the candidates are
8138860 there are some at wide receiver and defensive back but the rest of the positions are somewhat set
8138861 if he can handle the increased load hell be ready to go
8138862 if the trainer says theyll be out eight more weeks then they might not be on the roster
8138863 were serious about everyone we consider and ty is one to consider
8138864 only time will tell say we lose five dbs in this next game then the situation changes
8138865 joshua cribbs is the best return man around and you cant replace him but i feel ive done a good enough job filling in
8138866 high resolution satellite imaging is moving from the black world of intelligence to the white world of commerce and tom clancys h a w x will bring that reality to gamers

8138868 we are extremely grateful to geoeye for their collaboration with ubisoft and pleased with the level of quality and service weve received
8138869 geoeyes amazing imagery combined with the intense aerial combat experience in h a w x makes this a perfect partnership for everyone especially gamers

8138883 after speaking with the commission staff and some veterans service organization staff we concluded that the relationship exists between them especially at the leadership level could be characterized more as adversarial than cooperative in nature
8138884 we need to send a strong message that there needs to be a more cooperative working relationship that veterans know that we care about the care they are receiving

8138910 they chose not to ask whether it was a conflict of interest for general electric to both own nbc and be one of the primary sponsors of the games as well as the supplier of much of the games electronic security apparatus including 300 000 close circuit cameras all indications are that these cameras will most likely remain in place once the world has turned its attention elsewhere

8138918 everyone talks about one point we played over 200 points
8138919 i understand he can be really sad about that one point because he lost three match points in that match its not my problem its his problem
8138920 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
8138921 when you play for your country its a little bit different
8138922 normally on tour you play by yourself in the olympics people are following you at home its a little more pressure to do that its a great experience

8138964 die schijnbare komedie met een bittere nasmaak is een mijlpaal in het hedendaags theater
8138965 ik had het niet makkelijk in 1992 arriveerde ik in amerika als toeriste zonder de juiste documenten twee jaar werkte ik in restaurants later ging ik in londen studeren en in 1996 werkte ik op freelancebasis met orlin samen logisch trouwens dat mijn solowerk niet zo bekend is in het buitenland ik begon nog maar drie jaar geleden toch loopt het de laatste jaren aardig
8138966 na schooltijd gaf ik hedendaagse dans aan jongeren eenvoudige training en introducties in basisbewegingen en posities in afrika zit de dansscene in de lift toch heb ik het gevoel dat de zogeheten jonge choreografen een jaar of vier meer nodig hebben hun vroegtijdige aantreden op de grote sc nes heeft alles te maken met de vraag van de markt wie begint te dansen is twee jaar later professionele choreografe helaas doven die sterren weer snel uit je moet je lichaam goed kennen vooraleer je iemand anders iets kunt vertellen over of met je lijf
8138967 ik haat het om mezelf te omschrijven als iemand die in haar voorstellingen racistische themas en vrouwenproblemen aankaart maar uiteindelijk gaat mijn werk toch daarover die pijnpunten omringen me met die zaken heb ik dagelijks te maken aan de andere kant is het in mijn land niet al kommer en kwel we kampen met aids ziektes en geweld maar we lachen en spelen evenzeer hoewel ook dat in mijn werk aan bod komt is pijn hetgeen ons als gemeenschap het meest beroert
8138968 in het verleden voelde ik me vaak als een exotische figuur gepresenteerd als een mooi zwartje zondermeer als danser word je soms ingezet als iets bruikbaars voor de producer choreograaf of andere betrokkenen vooral met orlin maakte ik armoedige omstandigheden mee strangelove ontwierp een sc ne die tegelijkertijd een groot kostuum is een monster dat nieuwe bewegingen noodzaakt en waarop ik animatiefilms projecteer over een meisje dat een make over ondergaat
8138969 in die voorstelling lig ik samen met twee blanke acteurs op de grond in een raster van witte tape wanneer je dat projecteert lijkt het alsof we rechtstaan het is een stuk over zwart wit en cartoons maar ook over rassenissues zuid afrika heet in theorie een regenboognatie maar de werkelijkheid is anders daaraan wil ik mijn publiek blijven herinneren

8138978 and therefore not attacking the farmers but attacking those who provide the opportunity for farmers to cultivate opium
8138979 they bring a lot of heavy weapons and heavy logistical support from other areas in order to enter the camp to destroy the camp and to kill civilians this is the strategy of omar al bashir since he came from turkey he said that he wants to confront the international community he wants to wipe all the camps from the map in darfur

8138981 we are concerned about what is going on of course and we are engaging the government of south darfur it is not the first time that these kind of events took place last year it was an almost similar scenario so we have to come out with a lasting solution and as a matter of fact the government of south darfur asked us to organize a meeting with idp representatives and representatives from international ngos to find a solution to this tension which is prevailing in this big and huge camp since a long time
8138982 we are very very very astonished by the failure of the unamid forces
8138983 they came to protect civilians and now they let civilians be killed by the khartoum government
8138984 with explosions continuing and a fire raging it is quite treacherous for rescuers since there are huge hidden dangers amid the blasts along with leaks of toxic gases such as ammonia and formaldehyde
8138985 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8138986 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8138987 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility

8138994 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8138995 by proposing to ban uranium mining the premier and state alp government is effectively robbing one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country of the right to earn a living and potentially achieve an equity stake in a major mining project
8138996 there has been a great deal of mischievous scare mongering on the issue of uranium in wa and there will be serious long term consequences for indigenous people and wa as a whole
8138997 however the wider effect of this policy will be to reinforce the growing international perception that was mining policies are not conducive to investment
8138998 uranium and other mining companies will be reconsidering their plans to invest in wa today
8138999 cme is calling for the government to not proceed with such legislation if it is re elected
8139000 the future of uranium mining in western australia should be considered in the context of strategic resource development planning in wa and as part of a wider debate around future energy supplies and greenhouse gas abatement
8139001 cci is also disappointed that the alp in wa has declared that nuclear power has no future in wa without undertaking a sensible and rational debate on the issue
8139002 such a debate would be the opportunity to expose the misconceptions and misleading statements about uranium mining that are being put about in western australia

8139009 when i first met ned colletti in 1980 he was covering the flyers for the philadelphia journal a colorful newspaper that had a short life i mention this background because even back then colletti seemed more absorbed by baseball than the sport that was his beat that he is now the respected general manager of the los angeles dodgers shouldnt come as a surprise
8139010 colletti has seemingly been at his best this summer wheeling and dealing in an attempt to fill in the gaps in a battle with arizona for the national league west crown he energized the clubhouse landing third baseman casey blake from cleveland and pulled off a blockbuster three team deal for bostons disgruntled future hall of famer manny ramirez
8139011 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8139012 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8139013 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period

8139019 they dont look at palestinian politics which includes what is aired on the radio taught in school and preached in the mosque all of which makes up public opinion
8139020 what people say in arabic is really what is important
8139021 abu mazen is in many ways relatively moderate but he is not moderate on the palestinian refugees right of return which is very close to his heart

8139067 most supporters will be sitting under the open night sky but a group of lobbyists and corporate executives will watch the event from plush skyboxes with catered food and a flowing bar and a price tag of up to 1 million
8139068 corporations have turned our national nominating conventions into an opportunity for executives and lobbyists to wine dine and schmooze lawmakers all under the pretense of a public purpose
8139069 today the presidential nominating conventions are not very newsworthy because the presumptive nominees are chosen in advance fewer people care about the conventions as declining tv viewership shows and yet more special interest money than ever is raised and spent at the conventions
8139070 under the guise of civic boosterism unlimited and unregulated contributions are funneled through a giant loophole to host committees that largely serve the political purpose of providing advertising and access to corporate and other moneyed contributors

8139074 the blue dogs fundraising advantage has been in their ability to capture pro business interest groups that usually swing republican while simultaneously receiving money from left leaning ideological groups

8139087 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8139088 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8139089 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8139098 bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show

8139103 john mccain is a man who has served his nation in the military he served it in a prison camp

8139105 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8139106 a lot of people came here just because they wanted to celebrate hillary
8139107 we get criticism because theres this idea that the election should move on and just leave her behind were not going down that quietly
8139108 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got into arguments from time to time who contributed so generously to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8139109 so lets devote all the passion and the energy we have and theres a lot of it
8139110 it just makes me upset because hillary would have been the perfect woman to do this job
8139111 im a democrat first but its just difficult to get over
8139112 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8139113 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8139114 hillary got a raw deal right we dont want obama right it seems like were on the same team
8139115 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price
8139116 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8139117 if you cant get excited about voting for mccain these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against obama
8139118 if he thinks his long association with an unrepentant domestic terrorist is nothing the american people should be concerned about hes delusional or naive

8139124 this is not the time for excuses we have been outplayed england are playing with huge motivation and huge aggression
8139125 we have got to find out what the problem is we have got a lot of experience and we have got to tap into a bit of that
8139126 we have had times on this tour when we have had to look at each other honestly and find out what mistakes we are making our rhythm and confidence is not right i dont think reading the riot act is going to help
8139127 outside of world cup semi finals this is right down there in terms of lows we did not assess conditions well enough
8139128 we have got to look at ourselves and match the england team in the way we have matched in the time that i have been involved all of us need to get together
8139129 it was not a 280 wicket and that affected how we played there was a bit of bounce but if we could have got 230 we could have put them under a pressure but when you are only chasing 80 you play with freedom
8139130 i am trying to get into him that it is really great to be on a wave but you have got to get to a level where you are cool and calm and deliver
8139131 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8139132 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8139133 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8139134 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8139135 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8139136 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8139137 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8139138 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8139139 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8139140 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8139141 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8139142 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8139143 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8139144 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8139145 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8139146 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8139147 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8139148 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8139149 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8139150 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8139151 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8139152 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8139153 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8139154 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8139155 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8139156 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8139157 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8139158 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8139159 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8139160 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8139161 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8139162 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8139163 who are open to doing something on the production side
8139164 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8139165 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8139166 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8139167 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8139168 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8139169 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8139170 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8139171 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8139172 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8139173 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8139174 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8139175 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8139176 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8139177 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8139178 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8139179 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8139180 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8139181 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8139182 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8139183 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8139184 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8139185 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8139186 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8139187 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8139188 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8139189 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8139190 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8139191 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8139192 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8139193 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8139194 we didnt like the way the democratic process went during the primaries

8139230 two security researchers have demonstrated a new technique to stealthily intercept internet traffic on a scale previously presumed to be unavailable to anyone outside of intelligence agencies like the national security agency the tactic exploits the internet routing protocol bgp border gateway protocol to let an attacker surreptitiously monitor unencrypted internet traffic anywhere in the world and even modify it before it reaches its destination

8139245 how to add 100k or more in revenue in the next six month
8139246 a number of for profit companies have expressed concerns about securing leases even on public properties the city of morgantown the monongalia county development authority and morgantown utility board collectively they have 2 000 acres of undeveloped property that might be good candidates for such leases
8139247 there are two main concerns and they have to do with water one is the amount of water thats used in the process of drilling the wells the other has to do with pollution that comes back out of the wells that needs to be appropriately treated
8139248 that is one very important consideration to the potential proposals that the city would receive there are new drilling techniques and extraction techniques and all of those would be looked at very carefully
8139249 i think it would help if the wvdep looked at it more carefully and did start regarding more information and regulate this more carefully
8139250 i think since we dont have those laws now at a local level it is up to the land owners and city councils to take it upon themselves
8139251 senator obama you know its on the tips of everyones tongues and were so happy that everyones talking about him
8139252 everything we do here is on the soles of our feet and were out beating the pavement talking to our friends talking to family and neighbors and letting them know what the issues are so they can vote the issues and not the person
8139253 i just hope everyone takes the time to study the issues vote the issues and most importantly raise that thirty percent to seventy percent
8139254 we have a 1982 easement with peco energy from township line road in cromby up to fricks lock
8139255 from fricks lock north is where we are negotiating with landowners
8139256 our goal is to sign it uniformly and find access points and trailheads
8139257 thats important when you have a regional trail with thousands of visitors a day
8139258 i thought then and i still do what a heroic act
8139259 my feeling in 1976 is the same as it is today that two individuals were wrong in desecrating a symbol of the rights and freedoms that we have

8139264 this investigation deals a major blow to a drug trafficking organization which operated primarily out of the city of chester

8139272 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
8139273 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
8139274 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
8139275 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
8139276 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
8139277 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8139278 mastery trees will increase the power of all spells within this mastery

8139284 the pads last whistle blow is unjustified unnecessary provocative and illegal

8139286 repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8139287 this has a lot of peoples interest and my sense is they want to be thorough and complete were doing it as expeditiously as we can
8139288 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8139289 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8139290 i think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight
8139291 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8139292 nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8139293 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8139294 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8139295 there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8139296 its a very powerful speech hes going to come out of this convention the way barack obama came out of the last convention as the rock star as the next guy
8139297 it was an important speech because if this election is about experience and strength mccain wins but if this elections about the past versus the future republicans have a much tougher job
8139298 there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama the reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time
8139299 could not believe how close obama was to becoming president
8139300 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8139301 the economy today is in much worse shape than it was a year ago
8139302 if i had to pick one place to ride out the recession of 2008 2009 it would be the state of texas

8139307 to unite our people and forge a clear national direction
8139308 abdullah does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8139309 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8139310 i think abdullah should strongly consider for all our sakes to step down now

8139332 cynical and calculated attempt to divert police and public attention from the governments u turn on the democratic rights of police officers
8139333 for the last two years both the commissioner and the minister have insisted that the decision on tasers was a decision solely for the commissioner
8139334 yet now almost a year to the day since the trial concluded we have the minister announcing the decision in parliament a day after the governments backroom deal with new zealand first to keep police off councils
8139335 this decision could have been made by the commissioner at any time since he received the trial evaluation in december last year
8139336 instead the announcement can only be viewed with bitter irony as it highlights the politicisation of the highest levels of police at a time when constables are being banned from participating in their own local community councils
8139337 we didnt know what it meant and we didnt know how it would work in schools
8139338 this appeal was never really about the student it was about clarification

8139354 it is a waste of time and money to purchase equipment or hire a pi without being reasonably certain that something is going on our phone tracing particularly cell phone tracing proves that the person in question is talking to someone behind their partners back for some people such knowledge is enough for others it just marks to beginning on the investigation
8139355 if someone notices such behavior or sees strange phone numbers on their partners cell phone or even on the landline caller id there is cause for concern frequent hang ups or harassing calls from persons unknown normally indicate that the other man or woman is behaving in a jealous and likely unstable manner
8139356 anyone claiming to have access to a cell phone database or promising instant results is simply lying there is no cell phone database and likely never will be only a real time investigation can return the true information we provide such as the name and address corresponding to a given cellular number

8139371 we have seen first hand what the lack of tummy time can mean for a baby developmental cognitive and organizational skills delays eye tracking problems and behavioral issues to name just some complications
8139372 amass and quantify the observations of early motor delays as well as identify causal factors
8139373 new parents are told of the importance of babies sleeping on their backs to avoid sids but they are not always informed about the importance of tummy time
8139374 since the early 1990s we have seen a significant decrease in sids cases while simultaneously witnessing an alarming increase in skull deformation
8139375 the survey does not definitively identify lack of tummy time as the cause of the increase in early motor delays rather the survey quantifies experienced observations by qualified professionals which may serve as a hypothesis for a future scientifically controlled study on the rate of increase and causes of early motor delays
8139376 in addition to back sleeping and lack of tummy time
8139377 the increase may also be caused by factors such as a higher survival rate of preterm babies increased numbers of twins and triplets who may be crowded in the uterus and increased survival of children with cardiac neurological and genetic disorders

8139394 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8139395 its used in other sports so i dont know why baseball was opposed to it yes weve dealt with the human element for a long time in baseball but there have been a lot of bad calls over the years that im sure the umpires didnt go home and sleep well after seeing it on replay ive lost a couple of home runs over the years that were called foul but i just think its always right to make the right call for all parties
8139396 im an old school guy and i still feel that its the umpires call to make whether its the right one or the wrong one the human element is what makes baseball so great and so much fun because with the naked eye you can either make it right or make it wrong
8139397 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8139398 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8139399 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8139400 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8139401 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8139402 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8139403 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8139404 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8139405 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8139406 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8139407 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8139408 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8139409 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8139410 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8139411 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8139412 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8139413 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8139414 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8139415 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8139416 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8139417 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8139418 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing

8139422 people have noticed that even in the grocery store because of fuel and transportation and all that goes with it it just costs more to feed a family
8139423 the air force has traditionally outsourced its support to contractors

8139439 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8139440 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8139441 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out

8139448 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8139449 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
8139450 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
8139451 the market continues to question the same things and were not really getting any answers
8139452 i think thats one of the reasons why people are staying on the sidelines
8139453 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front

8139459 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8139460 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8139461 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8139462 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8139463 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8139464 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8139465 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8139466 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising

8139488 i dont think she did too well on saying i love america that wasnt adequate enough because look people are gonna hear that and then those that have paid attention to her earlier comments are gonna try and square those two off
8139489 do you think that you know her saying that she loves america that she loves this country is going to do it for those who questioned her patriotism because she said something what she said was and i wrote it down was the world as it is just wont do if you replace world with country youre back to the same debate arguably that you have been having about michelle obamas feelings about this country did she give her critics any fodder with that comment

8139583 now in terms of the weapons coming in from syria those weapons that youve described as coming in from syria and perhaps other sunni neighbors are killing our troops do we have a plan to address the syrian weapon source of killings of our troops
8139584 sir i know the military is working that border area to close it down from not only weapons but also jihadists coming in
8139585 its more than just were trying to close down the iranian border area too the problem is that these weapons are coming from a state which is doesnt recognize israel either just like iran doesnt weve got to try to stop weapons coming into iraq from any source that are killing our troops i agree with the comments about trying to stop them coming in from iran i think we have to try stop them that are going to the sunni insurgents as well as to the shia i was just wondering does the military have a plan to if necessary to go into syria to go to the source of any weapons coming from syria that are going to sunni insurgents that are killing our troops i think we ought to take action on all fronts including syria and any other source of weapons coming in obviously iran is the focus but it shouldnt be the sole focus

8139610 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8139611 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8139612 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8139613 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8139614 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8139615 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8139616 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8139617 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising

8139623 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8139624 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8139625 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8139626 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out

8139651 ze had al meerdere keren gedreigd hen om te brengen
8139652 ik zou zo snel mogelijk cht afscheid willen nemen en hen nog een keertje zien vorige zondag heb ik nog een paar uurtjes zo leuk met hen gespeeld in het park van kapellen ik mocht hen nog eens zien van chantal en nu moet ik een begrafenis regelen ik heb zelfs geen fotootjes of knuffels ik mocht niets meenemen van chantal maar uit mijn geheugen kan ze ze niet wissen
8139653 ze wist dat ik het niet lang meer zou volhouden het was haar manier om mij bij haar te houden ik wist dat mijn vrouw het heel moeilijk had ze was zwaar depressief en zei voortdurend dat ze geen leven had daarom ook is ze op mijn aandringen een paar maanden in behandeling geweest bij een psychiater maar daar is ze dan plots weer mee gestopt
8139654 ik heb huishoudhulp en opvang gezocht voor junior we zijn naar het comit voor bijzondere jeugdzorg getrokken maar om de kinderen te laten plaatsen was er een wachtlijst van vier maanden wat kon ik nog meer doen de politie was op de hoogte van de dreigementen maar die kende haar grappen ook al ze had me al meermaals smsjes gestuurd dat ze de kinderen had vermoord twee weken geleden nog in het midden van de nacht ik wist dat er een risico bestond maar ik had nooit gedacht dat ze het ook echt zou doen chantal was zo ze schreeuwde continu om aandacht op een ziekelijke manier ik voel me zo machteloos nu en ben ergens ook kwaad op het systeem want we hebben wel degelijk hulp gezocht en wat het nog ondraaglijker maakt is vooral dat er geen concrete aanleiding was
8139655 de echtscheiding was in gang gezet maar ik wilde alles regelen met onderlinge toestemming en daar waren we mee bezig het afgelopen weekend zouden julieke en junior eigenlijk bij mij zijn geweest maar we hadden vrijdag nog een gesprek gehad met het comit van bijzondere jeugdzorg en plots wilde chantal wispelturig als ze was niet meer dat ze bij mij zouden blijven ze wilde alleen dat ik weer naar huis kwam
8139656 maar er was gewoon geen weg meer terug het ging al lang niet goed meer tussen ons in 2005 zijn we al eens uiteengegaan maar toen bleek chantal plots zwanger van junior en hebben we besloten het nog maar eens te proberen maar eigenlijk hadden we continu ruzie en chantal kon heel agressief uit de hoek komen de jongste maanden heeft ze meerdere keren een keukenmes getrokken naar mij op de duur was het zo erg dat haar kinderen uit een vorige relatie red tussenbeide moesten komen de situatie was voor hen niet meer gezond en evenmin voor julie en junior
8139657 het leek me verstandiger rust te cre ren en de woning te verlaten zij kon zich daar niet bij neerleggen ze stuurde mails naar mijn collegas in nederland waar mijn kabinet is of vanuit mijn eigen mailadres naar zichzelf en daar liep ze dan mee naar de politie ze heeft zelfs eens een vriendin naar mijn assistente laten bellen om te zeggen dat ze zich had opgehangen ze stookte ook haar andere kinderen op om mij te pesten eigenlijk is het altijd een heel verwrongen gezin geweest maar de komst van onze kinderen heeft de problemen alleen maar groter gemaakt

8139673 did jesus exploit his racial status did he glorify israelite descent as a key to heaven no rather he was crucified because he repudiated the pharisaic doctrine of racial nationalism
8139674 if you choose to oppose this book do so on solid ground do not regurgitate the calumny of rabbis and zionists that judaism discovered incites jew hate if the book teaches you nothing else god grant you the grace to understand that it is the rabbis themselves who are the worlds most flagrant and virulent judaic haters
8139675 the zionist regime in palestine is satanic to the core
8139676 without divine permission the rebuilding of the hypothetical israelite commonwealth would be as spinoza had the prescience to foresee in the 17th century

8139746 they are looking to see if they feel comfortable and safe and looking at this campus to see if they can have fun and belong here note email address will not be published
8139747 policies against iran interfere with our policy of independence for the caspian nations
8139748 u s moves to foil iran pipeline kazakhs seek loans for alternate routes
8139749 i think wed be better off if we in fact backed off those iran sanctions didnt try to impose secondary boycotts on australian companies like bhp trying to do business over there
8139750 i think the hawkish iranian policy the us is following is also inappropriate frankly
8139751 i think we ought to begin to work to rebuild those relationships with iran it may take 10 years but its important that we do that
8139752 are imprisoned not for any crime that they committed but for their political activities which threatened putins totalitarian regime
8139753 he did not bring up those subjects and so we didnt either
8139754 i liked mr lantos attitude he had a lot to say about how russia and the us are on the same side of the barricade and that the problem is that in many cases they have not yet arrived at mutual understanding when confronting threats and challenges that they both face
8139755 an important statement one that will have historical significance for russian american relations
8139756 its time to put behind us this relic of the cold war
8139757 i will spare no effort to bring this about and i have every expectation that i will be successful
8139758 fully understandable attempt to demonstrate that his country a former superpower was resurgent after years of post soviet demise and stressed that putins criticism should not stand in the way of the two countries cooperation
8139759 the united states and russia have far too many common interests and long term goals
8139760 we certainly will not allow putins munich speech to stand in the way of our very positive attitude towards russia and our future cooperation
8139761 because of the embargo a number of third countries declined to supply equipment to iran thats why russian producers have to provide all the equipment all of a sudden its a tough situation
8139762 i dont know if nabucco needs a lot of help from america and europe but we are all for it
8139763 i think the iranians have proved themselves to be difficult associates
8139764 although president bush has said that no option is off the table i dont think a u s attack on iran is likely our policy is to change the behavior of the iranian government through diplomacy not to change the regime
8139765 im the guy who you know came up with the abdullah peace plan in an interview with the king of saudi arabia
8139766 when you mention the other sides plan and add all is open for negotiation it means that you are not going to stand firm on defensible borders in the golan heights or in judea and samaria
8139767 those who believe that redividing jerusalem by advancing the saudi plan will lower the flames of radical islamic rage have absolutely no idea of what they are dealing with any proposal to give the hamas government the hope of taking over jerusalem will shoot up jihadism in the region by giving new hope to al qaeda affiliates that jerusalem is within their grasp
8139768 i dont know but umm i already have a few weird things happening to me so this does not bother me to have two more voices beside my own now i have four voices in my head including mine
8139769 jeff ride why are you laughing like a hyena care to share
8139770 until four years when she changes her name to maximum and marries nick
8139771 the pershing is outdated and some concerts will not come to town
8139772 we need the arena to keep the entertainment level at the same level as we have had it in the past
8139773 everything is on hold until we hear from the public
8139774 were looking at designs and overall costs and identifying revenue sources
8139775 a new arena adds enthusiasm and increases attendance by as much as 15 percent in some cases
8139776 we have a lot of work to do we didnt play well enough we didnt coach well enough and it just wasnt good enough
8139777 hes just trying to get his feet back underneath him
8139778 i think they are expecting between 70 000 and 90 000 people
8139779 i think the history and excitement will be unmatched by anything ive experienced
8139780 were going to have some food and drinks and hang out watching barack obama accept the official nomination for the democratic party
8139781 the first thing we do is decrease the number of single rooms
8139782 that has allowed us to free up about 240 new rooms so far
8139783 this is the fourth or fifth straight year where the percentage of students living in university housing has gone up
8139784 there are a lot of things that we do to make sure theres room for each of them
8139785 this is something that we look at early on in the summer
8139786 if we see the need we can add sections of classes or just move them into a larger classroom
8139787 the point is coming where we are going to need more classrooms
8139788 the attention is nice after being under the radar for a while
8139789 at the beginning i just set goals for myself and then once i reached those goals i would just bump it up more and more until i got to the point where i am right now
8139790 you just have to work hard be patient and good things will happen
8139791 there are some guys that get down and being where im at im able to tell walk ons that there were times when i was down and that i was in their shoes at one point and kind of help them through that
8139792 a lot of people have said that we underachieved last year and me personally i dont want to have that on me
8139793 cody phil dillard and i are just really close and i think we mesh really well together we know what each other has to do on different plays and i think well be able to use that to our advantage
8139794 for me the biggest thing is i want to be assignment sound perfect
8139795 i am a new day rising im a brand new sky
8139796 this team is a about learning to live again to give to love again
8139797 shes doing great considering shes had almost a year and a half off
8139798 i know i would be super nervous and i think she did a great job
8139799 we need to believe in ourself that we can make it and well be fine
8139800 to hang the stars upon tonight i am a little divided
8139801 they gotta get a feel for how theyre going to have to play
8139802 they have a lot of new players out there and they have to get that feel and play with each other and together
8139803 equality day is an amazing holiday to celebrate because more than half of the population got the right to vote particularly in such an important election year that is crucially important
8139804 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal
8139805 suffrage wasnt why they got together it was an additional request to other larger demands and it was considered a radical demand to be making
8139806 over 200 women from 26 states were arrested for protests and they were treated pretty poorly once they got into jail
8139807 the lengths of their sentences progressively increased and they began hunger striking their jailers brutally forced food down their throats
8139808 the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex
8139809 the stadium is one of the loudest in the nation and they are expecting to have 50 000 or 60 000 in attendance
8139810 chastity does not mean abstention from sexual wrong it means something flaming like joan of arc
8139811 we all live together in the same house so the hardest thing to overcome is being roommates and kind of feeling like youre married to each other
8139812 theres no julia or there might be i dont know
8139813 i havent met her yet and she doesnt know anything that i know of
8139814 im not bashing anybody but when i saw katy perrys album cover for one of the boys and pinks song stupid girls its like theres so many female artists that try to make names for themselves by defacing or defaming what makes us women and im totally not into that
8139815 we love putting on lipstick we love shopping and we love art and we love music and we love politics and its okay we dont have to be these like farting beer drinking disgusting women to be cool we dont have to be like men to exist
8139816 thats whats being a woman owning what you do and knowing who you are and not apologizing for it
8139817 i hate when women want to act like men to be women or to be considered strong i think its just as strong that i want to go home and make my dad dinner that makes me a woman
8139818 people are drawn to the thought that its like pure pop and theres so much joy in it
8139819 i take myself very seriously but i dont write about things that are too serious i write about love and art and music and dance and glamour and new york city i write about the things i know about i think its refreshing its light but its heavy its all those things that make a record feel good
8139820 i think a lot of it is the womens fault in some kind of way
8139821 because were not being careful enough with what were saying about our sexuality and what were saying about ourselves as women theres a way to empower yourself as a sexual being thats intelligent and theres ways that you dont do that
8139822 i dont victimize myself as a female artist i am who i am and if im not being recognized its because im not good enough you have to work within the culture you have you have to flip it on its side and make people look at it differently
8139823 id be in offices and theyd say can you stand up
8139824 just looking at me like i was a fucking product honest to god i was in office meetings and theyd asked me to stand up and turn around before even putting my demo in to me that was disgusting
8139825 as a woman theres not very much expected of us from a creative standpoint probably because the industry has produced so much puppetry
8139826 dont get me wrong im a pretty girl but thats not what makes me interesting
8139827 we are pleased that the outcome will allow tennessee school systems to upgrade technology for the benefit of their students and allow additional resources to be directed toward improving teaching and learning
8139828 the department is working diligently to help districts take advantage of these vouchers in a timely manner
8139829 since america came into iraq uninvited it should not leave iraq uninvited
8139830 its going to drive the democratic presidential primaries to the left on national security and the iraq war
8139831 and its going to make it difficult for anyone to stand by their decision to vote to authorize the war
8139832 send the message that centrist hawks are unwelcome in the democratic party
8139833 while the republicans may be forced to reform themselves after the 06 elections the democrats will be emboldened and not inclined to change so the weaknesses that were evident in the 04 campaign will never be addressed
8139834 the paradox of 06 is that the republicans could be forced to get their act together while the democratic left will be completely reinforced by the results
8139835 labor was strongly against this legislation when it was forced through the senate they must not forget about it now they are the government
8139836 when the act was forced through the senate labor described it as extreme arrogant heavy handed draconian sorry sordid extraordinary and profoundly shameful the greens agree with the labors assessment and we call on the prime minister to repeal the act immediately
8139837 the chief minister of the northern territory paul henderson has also written to kevin rudd stating the northern territorys opposition in the strongest terms and seeking confirmation of the governments commitment and proposed timing of the repeal
8139838 nobody wants nuclear waste the answer is to stop creating it but in the meantime the prime minister should announce the timetable for delivering this election promise immediately
8139839 iraq is being turned into a battleground between iran and the united states
8139840 ali faysal al lami is a member of the shii political bureau and the political coordinator of the group in the united iraqi alliance that supports the nomination of iraqi national congress leader ahmad al chalabi to the post of prime minister
8139841 the principal story of the 2006 mid term elections is that voters were driven by their opposition to the war in iraq
8139842 this was not a vote for the democrats so much as against president bush and against the war in iraq
8139843 we need to begin a phased redeployment of forces from iraq in four to six months
8139844 the point of this is to signal to the iraqis that the open ended commitment is over and that they are going to have to solve their own problems
8139845 i dont think were going to be receptive to the notion theres a fixed timetable at which we automatically pull out because that could be a true disaster for the iraqi people but what weve always been prepared to do and remain prepared to do is indeed what senators levin and biden were talking about is put pressure on the iraqi government to take over themselves
8139846 has to understand that we need to put down sadr and we need to take care of the mahdi army and we need to stop the sectarian violence that is on the increase in a non acceptable level
8139847 a pentagon strategy review ordered by gen peter pace the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is backing the idea as is a separate panel studying iraq options led by former secretary of state james a baker iii the senior official said
8139848 one of the groups fighting for control of the city
8139849 he must change this is not his private office he should represent all iraqis
8139850 your so sexy your what i want id love to have u spread on the bed with your legs up so i can suck that pussy and finger u and bounce on it mmm i wanna give it to u
8139851 an insurgent leader responsible for numerous deaths of iraqi citizens
8139852 issue a fatwa prohibiting the killing of shia so as to preserve muslim blood and must prohibit membership of al qaeda or any other organisation that has made the shia their enemies
8139853 no war in 04 and the bush administration appears to moderate its policy in iraq appointing an ex baathist as its first prime minister reversing previous de baathification orders and handing fallujah to a baathist military officer brent scowcroft predicts that a second term will see diminished neocon power neocon aftermath with the 2004 elections out of the way the bush administration reverses course and reinvigorates the neocon project launching a massive assault on fallujah and sponsoring three major votes elections in january and december 2005 and the constitutional referendum in october 2005 that alienate sunni arabs and empower the shiite and kurdish populations 2006 midterms the bush administration welcomes the formation of an iraq study group led by realist right arabist james baker and suggests that it is willing to consider all kinds of tactical changes including quiet chatter about an anti shiite coup neocon aftermath it is too early to fill in the blanks regarding the neocon aftermath of the 2006 midterms but one can imagine the basic outlines regime change in iran etc the general pattern of pre election hesitancy and post election audacity looks set to continue full speed ahead
8139854 it may not be popular with the public it doesnt matter in the sense that we have to continue what we think is right
8139855 thats exactly what were doing were not running for office were doing what we think is right
8139856 i think itll have some effect perhaps in the congress
8139857 but the presidents made clear what his objective is its victory in iraq and its full speed ahead on that basis and thats exactly what were going to do
8139858 the real factor bush has to fear is a collapse of support among republicans as well as democrats
8139859 the fire lasted for the duration of the operation and continued as they left the neighborhood
8139860 should not happen again in order to protect the reconciliation process
8139861 i reiterate my rejection to such an operation and it should not be executed without my consent this particular operation did not have my approval
8139862 its true that we are targeting death squads but we are not going after the madhi army in particular
8139863 if we were it would be much more violent here it would be a very big fight
8139864 abu dera profile of abu dera or abu dereh in robertsons spelling that paints a portrait that resembling the portrait of keyser s ze painted by roger
8139865 calm and patient and avoid being drawn into civil war
8139866 denounce the kidnapping of iraqis denounce destruction of mosques and denounce killing of innocent people said his aide mohammed al fartousi
8139867 the result was more failure for israel its allies and masters
8139868 after five weeks it israel was still struggling to occupy a few hundred metres
8139869 from a military perspective it the battle was decided in favour of the resistance hezbollah israel has been defeated from the beginning
8139870 at that time israel invaded lebanon with three divisions and within 48 hours all katusha rocket fire
8139871 in this day and age with all the technology we have there is no reason to start sending ground troops in
8139872 we do not ask anyone to fight with us or for us
8139873 a final divorce from the arab regimes and a full marriage with iran
8139874 you should be prepared now for political and economic pressure put on you because of this speech
8139875 the cabinet cannot say explicitly that hizbullah is not a militia because it will cause lebanon problems with the international community
8139876 disarmament is an internal issue and should be resolved by the lebanese
8139877 we have never called and will never call the resistance by any other name but the resistance and it is a national resistance and we will not use any other expression to describe it but national resistance
8139878 the president has not betrayed our ideology he is just trying to keep all of us in office
8139879 the genius of elliott abrams is that hes elliott abrams how can he be accused of not sufficiently supporting israel
8139880 the worst weapons will not fall into the worst hands
8139881 at its heart this was an argument about whether you could isolate the iranians enough to force some kind of regime change
8139882 runs counter to our efforts it would limit our diplomatic flexibility
8139883 they do not lie with a shiite militia that fights for iran
8139884 the israeli attacks and airstrikes are completely destroying lebanons infrastructure
8139885 i condemn these aggressions and call on the arab league foreign ministers meeting in cairo to take quick action to stop these aggressions we call on the world to take quick stands to stop the israeli aggression
8139886 the battle is all of islam against all of the nonbelievers
8139887 israel is conducting an armed invasion of lebanon in every sense of the word
8139888 the lebanese army and i stress the lebanese army will resist and defend and will prove that it is an army that deserves respect
8139889 i would hope that you would see very early on an end to large scale violence
8139890 were trying to deal with a problem that has been festering and brewing in lebanon now for years and years and years so its not going to be solved by one resolution in the security council
8139891 gathering of 30 iranians including analysts academics and members of religious and ethnic minorities was billed by the white house as a historic first step in promoting personal freedom and liberty in iran
8139892 the cabinet cannot say explicitly that hizbullah is not a militia because it will cause lebanon problems with the international community
8139893 such a statement would mean that un resolution 1559 had already been implemented and thus put lebanon in a state of confrontation with the security council
8139894 we see that there are steps that need to be stressed beginning with the security situation and the need to stop the killing machine
8139895 was and will still be the main support for lebanon
8139896 syrian initiative that wants to restore syrias control on lebanon
8139897 we will obtain revenge against those who got lebanon entangled
8139898 the druze the sunni muslims some of the maronite christians and maybe even some of the shiites are lying in wait for nasrallah
8139899 there is no doubt that they will hurl accusations at him for wreaking havoc in lebanon and there is no doubt that the issue of hizbullahs weapons will be raised it still seems that there is no one who can disarm hizbullah apart from nasrallah himself and southern lebanon is the organizations home it is reasonable to assume that it will do everything to rehabilitate and arm itself
8139900 we never thought a purely military solution could resolve the problem of hezbollah
8139901 we are agreed on the goal the disarmament but for us the means are purely political
8139902 if the us were to attack iran then it would do so knowing that its forces in iraq would be at an even greater risk than they currently are any us attack against tehran would expose the us presence in iraq to retaliatory destabilising interventions by tehran
8139903 washingtons biggest security headache as it considers whether to embark upon an assault against the islamic republic is neither irans ability to fight in the airspace nor even in the streets of its border towns if the us were indeed to surprise most analysts and attempt a land invasion the greatest threat to the us is irans ability to further destabilise the already chaotic public spaces of iraq
8139904 the great problem facing the us is that iran has superseded it as the most influential power in iraq this influence has a variety of forms but all can be turned against the us presence in iraq with relative ease and almost certainly would heighten us casualties to the point where a continued presence might not be tenable
8139905 an early supporter of the invasion to overthrow saddam hussein
8139906 i had my passport taken away from me for ten days by the iraqi security police in 1986 haunted by hussein
8139907 but we have said publicly and that remains our position wed be prepared to consider talking with them once the government of national unity is formed he said
8139908 there are channels for communicating reports that a prior effort by khalilzad to open a dialogue with iran in march of this year met with opposition from within the administration the source of that opposition and its meaning remains unclear
8139909 the conflict with sciri in basra dates back to early 2005 when after the local elections fadhila managed to sideline sciri in the local governorate council by entering into coalition with smaller parties
8139910 at first the tension was mainly fought out within the council then sciri boycotted the council for a while and now it seems that the conflict has begun affecting the general security situation in basra
8139911 there has always been a small possibility that basra could become something like the fallujah of the south
8139912 the american ambassador and the tyrants of the arab states are giving political support to those parties who provide political cover for the terrorists
8139913 he who owns basra owns the oil reserves it is the gateway to the gulf
8139914 its the richest city in the world it has a strategic position so why would any one give it up
8139915 according to the constitution the oil and gas are the property of all iraqi people the revenues will be put in the state coffer
8139916 the main concern for regions is to get its share and not to run the oilfields or sign any contracts
8139917 is not likely to be turned from its threatening behavior by policies that emphasize negotiations
8139918 the pace of nuclear weapons development might leave washington with what the committee believes is the least desirable option of waging military strikes against iran
8139919 could bring only disaster to the united states and to the world
8139920 the united states is supporting the sunnis and baathists course not
8139921 what the united states ought to have done two years ago namely make a deal with the resistance and its core baathist leadership might after all be happening it is unclear how far up the food chain in the bush administration this effort goes but it appears that a desperate ambassador khalilzad has realized the importance of forging ties to the baath party thats all good
8139922 chas freeman who served as us ambassador to saudi arabia during the first gulf war and a leading foe of the neocons
8139923 i believe that jewish culture has always favoured a gamblers approach to realpolitik anyway and that this is one of the distinctive features of the jewish world view success is to the bold to he who takes a high risk strategy
8139924 but she listened to me when they came to iraq absolutely they were biased to the shiites i think they are being more evenhanded than what they were before they realized they cannot solve the problems in iraq without us
8139925 i think if they can reach a good agreement with these groups they can jump to bigger groups
8139926 theres been a certain amount of pop sociology in america
8139927 that the shia cant get along with the sunni and the shia in iraq want to establish some kind of islamic fundamentalist regime theres been almost no evidence of that at all
8139928 a narrow realpolitik that defined americas vital interests in terms of oil wells strategic chokepoints and regional stability
8139929 creating democracy in a land that for decades has known only dictatorship
8139930 some kind of shia state controlling the bulk of iraqs oil
8139931 including the saudi kingdom where the main oil producing area is inhabited by a shia majority
8139932 the ensuing chaos of any policy that generates upheaval in iraq would offer the oppressed majority shiites of that country an opportunity to enhance their power and prestige fear that this would in turn enable iran to extend its influence through its coreligionists has led britain and the united states along with our middle eastern allies to regard a continued sunni control of iraq as the cornerstone for stability in the levant saudi arabia in particular fears that any shiite autonomy or control in iraq will undermine its own precarious stability because an emboldened shiite populace in iraq could spread its fervor into saudi arabias predominantly shiite northeastern provinces the saudi government also fears that this upheaval could spread to predominantly shiite bahrain or to other gulf states with large shiite minorities
8139933 my primary point is that you cant understand this war if you dont know that some key right zionists were extremely interested in sunni shiite politics at least at the level of
8139934 saying that they cared is not the same as saying that the were correct
8139935 the crucial point however is that some key neo conservatives are as committed to cold hearted machiavellian realpolitik as any so called realist
8139936 within the united states the main driving force behind the iraq war was a small band of neoconservatives many with close ties to israels likud party
8139937 cole again points to mistaken contentions about the shia held by neocons
8139938 i do not know enough about sunnis or shiites to access the
8139939 were an empire now and we create our own reality
8139940 not all neo conservatives were ignorant of shiite sunni relations indeed many neo cons right zionists were quite keen to exploit the domestic rivalry between shiite and sunni forces in iraq as a key basis for changing the balance of power in the region
8139941 to suppose that right zionists didnt understand the sunni shiite politics of iraq is foolishness and is not supported by the record
8139942 we want the expulsion of the occupier and not the american ambassador
8139943 sadr has worked overtime to try to keep his own rank and file base from retaliating against the sunni minority for anti shiite terror attacks
8139944 his militia seems to one of the driving forces of the sectarian killings
8139945 a clear arab stand should be taken on this israeli aggression against lebanon
8139946 lebanon should not be left as a battlefield for everyone and israel must know that lebanon is not a terrorist state but in fact a resisting state and that israel is the enemy
8139947 with its arms crossed and watch what transpires in palestine because it influences what happens in jordan for better or worse
8139948 the goal of the war party is to keep up the momentum for intervention created by the iraq war and allow the conflict there to naturally spill over iraqs borders into syria lebanon saudi arabia and beyond
8139949 it is topic a of every single conversation i dont have a friend in the administration on capitol hill or any part of the conservative foreign policy establishment who is not beside themselves with fury at the administration
8139950 we should do what we can to encourage a democratic alternative to saddam hussein
8139951 and above all we should not accept the replacement of saddam hussein with another general who will run yet one more authoritarian iraqi regime
8139952 venezuelas disip was well aware of the smuggling of cocaine from colombia trans shipped on a saudi diplomatic boeing 737 through venezuela by saudi royal family members who then used the proceeds to support al qaedas attack on america
8139953 were trying to separate the insurgents from the rest of the people
8139954 there are a lot of rumors flying around that people think its another falluja its not
8139955 the problem with kirkuk is the presence of oil in it it should be in the ownership of all iraqis no one has the right to demand kirkuk
8139956 pro israel jewish neoconservatives like paul wolfowitz douglas feith richard perle and others were among the key architects of the policy of preventative war and were the strongest advocates for a u s invasion of iraq
8139957 it is certainly true that all neo conservatives are strong supporters of israel
8139958 if the special interest of the investor is liable to clash with the public interest and to induce a wrecking policy still more dangerous is the special interest of the financier the general dealer in investments
8139959 there is something quite convenient and discomfortingly familiar about the tendency to blame an allegedly powerful and wealthy group of jews for the overall direction of an increasingly controversial u s policy indeed like exaggerated claims of jewish power at other times in history such an explanation absolves the real powerbrokers and assigns blame to convenient scapegoats this is not to say that mearsheimer walt or anyone else who expresses concern about the power of the israel lobby is an anti semite but the way in which this exaggerated view of jewish power parallels historic anti semitism should give us all pause
8139960 we got this information from iraqi security forces as well as the americans
8139961 they conducted several operations last night but they did not produce results
8139962 this is an attempt to thwart the road toward democracy and the rule of law we will continue to collect intelligence to ensure her safe return and those with her
8139963 an insurgent leader responsible for numerous deaths of iraqi citizens
8139964 we have orders from sayyid moqtada al sadr not to fight the americans now
